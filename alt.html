<p>In a tweet in 2024 Fenton wrote: <span class="quote">"Between 2016 and 2022, I attended many research seminars in the UK on using AI and Machine Learning to <span class="quote">'combat misinformation'</span>. The example of Hunter Biden's laptop was invariably used as a key <span class="quote">'learning'</span> example so algorithms classified it as <span class="quote">'misinformation'</span>, <span class="quote">'Russian propaganda'</span>, <span class="quote">'Trump lies'</span>. Moreover, anybody pushing that story was classified as a <span class="quote">'spreader of misinformation'</span>, <span class="quote">'conspiracy theorist'</span> etc. In fact, most of the common <span class="quote">'training'</span> examples that were used - many of which were based on things Trump supposedly said, as well as about Covid - turned out to be true. So an enormous amount of research was (and is still) spent on developing <span class="quote">'clever'</span> algorithms which simply censor the truth online."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/profnfenton/status/1829137988355281114>https://x.com/profnfenton/status/1829137988355281114</a>] The seminars Fenton described sound like they might have been organized by some organization connected to intelligence or mainstream media. Did he also attend seminars on how to produce disinformation in order to combat inconvenient information?</p>
<p>In an article where the Canadian company Calian described their disinformation services, they wrote: <span class="quote">"We have delivered disinformation components for military exercises, for domestic major event security and for nuclear power generation exercises ranging from coordinated campaigns across all media channels to limited disinformation activities on key issues."</span> They wrote that their training on information operations focuses on understanding how adversaries use disinformation, which sounds similar to the content of the seminars Fenton attended: <span class="quote">"Training on information operations should focus on understanding how adversaries use disinformation, who they are targeting, with what messaging and what effect they are trying to achieve. As mentioned earlier, disinformation is a deliberate process. Training for disinformation can help us unravel the intention, target and likely outcomes the authors and spreaders of disinformation are seeking to achieve."</span> [<a href=https://www.calian.com/resources/blogs/disinformation-in-digital-spaces-a-key-weapon-in-war-and-competition-below-the-threshold-of-armed-conflict/>https://www.calian.com/resources/blogs/disinformation-in-digital-spaces-a-key-weapon-in-war-and-competition-below-the-threshold-of-armed-conflict/</a>]</p>
<p>Fenton is a professor emeritus at the Queen Mary University of London, which is located about 3 km away from the City of London and about 10 km away from the headquarters of MI6. It's not very damning information by itself, but the London area is the UK equivalent of the DC area where the headquarters of various intelligence agencies are located, so people who live in the London area might be more likely to have intelligence connections than people who live in more remote regions of the UK. Clare Craig and Jonathan Engler also live in the London area according to their LinkedIn profiles.</p>
<p>In 2015 BBC released a mainstream documentary about climate change that was presented by Norman Fenton, Hannah Fry, and David Spiegelhalter: [<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jsdrk>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jsdrk</a>]</p>

<p>In 2022 Hannah Fry hosted a BBC documentary which criticized anti-vaxxers: [<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019g27>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019g27</a>]</p>

<p>In 2018 BBC released a documentary that starred Hannah Fry titled <span class="quote">"Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic"</span>: [<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/12/contagion-pandemic>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/12/contagion-pandemic</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The groundbreaking BBC Four experiment uses app technology to <span class="quote">'infect'</span> users whilst tracking their movements and social interactions over 24 hours. The information collected from the app could inform public health policy and help save lives during the next pandemic. But will Hannah persuade enough people nationwide to download it? If she does, this will allow a team of mathematicians from the University of Cambridge to create a simulation of how a deadly flu virus could spread across the UK, predicting how many of us will be infected - and how many might die.</p>
<p>Whilst Hannah masterminds the experiment and adopts the role of Patient Zero - walking the streets of Haslemere in Surrey to launch the outbreak - Javid finds out why flu is such a danger to society. He meets the researchers trying to discover what makes some people more contagious than others and visits a factory that will produce vaccine when the next pandemic virus emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the BBC documentary Hannah Fry seeded a fictional pandemic in the borough of Haslemere, which in February 2020 was reported to be the location of the first known COVID case with a UK origin (if cases in people who were infected outside the UK and brought the virus to the UK were excluded). [<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51683428>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51683428</a>] It might of course be a coincidence, but on the other hand the borough of Haslemere has a population of only about 20,000.</p>
<p>In 2025 Hannah Fry joined Cambridge as a <span class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of Mathematics"</span>, but before it she was an associate professor at another college in London. [<a href=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hannah-fry-joins-cambridge-as-professor-of-the-public-understanding-of-mathematics>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hannah-fry-joins-cambridge-as-professor-of-the-public-understanding-of-mathematics</a>] Wikipedia says that Fry's work <span class="quote">"has included studies of patterns of human behaviour, such as interpersonal relationships and dating, and how mathematics can apply to them"</span>. But before COVID, Fenton and Neil also published popularized articles about Bayesian analysis applied to topics like soccer, and they had a blog written for a popular audience. So both Fenton and Fry had an appropriate background to present information about COVID to a lay audience, even though they may have been cast to play roles on opposite sides of the debate (but that is only speculation and I don't yet have good evidence it's actually the case).</p>
<p>In 2019 Fenton also published a review of a popular science book by Hannah Fry: [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331812193>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331812193</a>, <a href=https://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.com/2019/03/hannah-frys-hello-world-and-example-of.html>https://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.com/2019/03/hannah-frys-hello-world-and-example-of.html</a>]</p>

<p>When I looked at replies to the tweet where Fenton wrote that he had attended several seminars on combating misinformation, I saw a tweet by Fenton's coauthor Scott McLachlan who wrote: <span class="quote">"You'll recall I attended several too. A noteable one was that of <span class="citation" data-cites="d_spiegel">@d_spiegel</span> who had the temerity to complain because I pointed out that he offered no proof to support his misinformation examples beyond that it was misinformation because he or similar <span class="quote">'clever'</span> folks said it was"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/LawHealthTech/status/1829139475202506974>https://x.com/LawHealthTech/status/1829139475202506974</a>] Now what's crazy is that d_spiegel is David Spiegelhalter, who was the third person who presented the BBC documentary about climate change together with Fenton and Hannah Fry.</p>
<p>In 2020 Spiegelhalter posted a tweet that said: <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'the most consistent predictor of decreased susceptibility to misinformation about Covid-19 was numerical literacy'</span> - great study (COI, by my colleagues) <a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201199>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201199</a> Data literacy is vital"</span>. The senior author of the paper he linked was Sander van der Linden. In 2019 van der Linden and Spiegelhalter were featured as authors of a paper titled <span class="quote">"Communicating uncertainty about facts, numbers and science"</span>, where they wrote about Bayesian analysis applied to science communication (but of course Fenton and Neil's main topic of expertise is also Bayesian analysis). [<a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181870>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181870</a>] The authors of the paper also included Alexandra Freeman, who was the producer of the BBC documentary that was presented by Fenton, Fry, and Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p>In 2020 another similar paper titled <span class="quote">"The effects of communicating uncertainty on public trust in facts and numbers"</span> was published by Anne Marthe van der Bles, Sander van der Linden, Alexandra Freeman, and David Spiegelhalter. [<a href=https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1913678117>https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1913678117</a>] In the paper they described an experiment where they published three different versions of a news article on the website of BBC News and they analyzed the response of the readers to the article.</p>
<p>Spiegelhalter, van der Linden, and Freeman have written two papers together that were published by the Journal of Risk Research, but the same journal has also published three papers by Neil and Fenton. [<a href=https://exaly.com/journal/19864/journal-of-risk-research/top-authors/most-cited/lifetime>https://exaly.com/journal/19864/journal-of-risk-research/top-authors/most-cited/lifetime</a>]</p>
<p>An article from 2021 which profiled Clare Craig as a misinformation spreader said: <span class="quote">"David Spiegelhalter, Cambridge University's Professor for Public Understanding of Risk, has reviewed and commented extensively on the death data - as has the Faculty of Public Health."</span> [<a href=https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/01/beware-scientifically-suspect-grief-grifting/>https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/01/beware-scientifically-suspect-grief-grifting/</a>] Apparently Spiegelhalter is a <span class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk"</span> at Cambridge in the same way that Hannah Fry is a <span class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of Mathematics"</span> at Cambridge. I didn't find any other Cambridge professors of public understanding. David Spiegelhalter was also a prominent public voice about COVID statistics, and he even published a book titled <span class="quote">"Covid By Numbers: Making Sense of the Pandemic with Data"</span>.</p>
<p>Fenton's connection to the psychologist Magda Osman is also suspicious. She was previously faculty at the Queen Mary University of London, and she has authored many papers with Fenton including several papers about COVID. [<a href=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=norman+fenton+magda+osman>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=norman+fenton+magda+osman</a>] In 2022 Magda Osman was the first author of a paper published by Journal of Risk Research titled <span class="quote">"People's understanding of the concept of misinformation"</span>, and in 2024 Osman published a paper titled <span class="quote">"Public Evaluations of Misinformation and Motives for Sharing It"</span>. [<a href=https://bmeder.org/publication/2022-03-18_osman_et_al-2022-misinformation/2022-03-18_Osman_et_al-2022-misinformation.pdf>https://bmeder.org/publication/2022-03-18_osman_et_al-2022-misinformation/2022-03-18_Osman_et_al-2022-misinformation.pdf</a>, <a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5172/5/2/50>https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5172/5/2/50</a>] In 2020 Osman, McLachlan, Fenton, Neil, and two other authors published a paper about <span class="quote">"nudging"</span> as a strategy of behavior modification. An article about the paper quoted Magda Osman as saying: <span class="quote">"We believe that causal analysis can advance existing behaviour change frameworks as they allow us to formally model behaviour change problems and the context in which these interventions are situated. By incorporating these approaches into the early design of behavioural interventions, we can begin to understand what factors are relevant to the success of the intervention and how the intervention could influence these factors, and even prepare precautionary measures to help avoid failure."</span> [<a href=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/news/items/nudges-fail-more-often-than-is-reported-experts-warn.html>https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/news/items/nudges-fail-more-often-than-is-reported-experts-warn.html</a>] Osman's research into the topics of misinformation and the psychology of behavior change are both red flags, since they are both topics that are connected with the production of deliberate disinformation.</p>
<p>Magda Osman's website says that her areas of research include <span class="quote">"examining effectiveness of methods of behavioural change"</span> and <span class="quote">"why nudges are not the answer to effective wide scale behavioural change"</span>. [<a href=https://www.magdaosman.com/>https://www.magdaosman.com/</a>] Her website also says: <span class="quote">"I have been working with Fuel (an arts based company) for several years now on several exciting projects, the most recent of which was <span class="quote">'the lab'</span> which is a Wellcome Trust funded project that helps bring life sciences researchers and artists together to work on innovating and representing scientific ideas to mass audiences. [...] I spent the day with the newly appointed government in this arts project, in which as scientific advisor I presented with them several interventions informed by behavioural change frameworks (like Nudge) to solve a social policy problem."</span></p>
<p>Magda Osman's THE LAB project commissioned three art projects which started in August 2020. One of them was about vaccines and another was about misinformation, even though vaccines were not yet a very common topic of discussion in August 2020: [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313024233/https://www.magdaosman.com/_files/ugd/8b1381_695ef92003a8487fb1b80584662c6038.pdf>https://web.archive.org/web/20220313024233/https://www.magdaosman.com/_files/ugd/8b1381_695ef92003a8487fb1b80584662c6038.pdf</a>]</p>

<p>In 2018 Fenton and Neil coauthored another paper with Magda Osman about nudging as a technique of behavioral change. The abstract of the paper said: <span class="quote">"Social policy interventions, such as nudges (behavioral change techniques), have gained significant traction globally. But what do the public think? Does the type of expert proposing a nudge influence the kinds of evaluations the public make about nudges? Three experiments investigated this by presenting U.S. (N = 689) and U.K. (N = 978) samples with descriptions of nudges (genuine and fictitious) proposed by either scientists or the government. Overall, compared to opaque and fictitious nudges, transparent and genuine nudges were judged more ethical and plausible, and scientists proposing them were judged more trustworthy than a government working group. Also, trust in fictitious interventions proposed by scientists was higher than in genuine interventions proposed by a government working group."</span> [<a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2018.1469986>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2018.1469986</a>] An article about the paper quoted Fenton as saying <span class="quote">"While people judged genuine nudges as more plausible than fictitious nudges, people trusted some fictitious nudges proposed by scientists as more plausible than genuine nudges proposed by government"</span> (which sounds just like alt media, where people readily believe outlandish claims as long as they come from a former chief scientist at Pfizer, or the inventor of mRNA vaccines, or a great egghead from London). [<a href=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2018/se/people-trust-scientific-experts-more-than-the-government-even-when-the-evidence-is-outlandish-.html>https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2018/se/people-trust-scientific-experts-more-than-the-government-even-when-the-evidence-is-outlandish-.html</a>]</p>
<p>In 2023 the BBC published a radio program presented by Magda Osman where she discussed the future of nudging as a method of behavior modification. [<a href=https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001slsl>https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001slsl</a>] Even though she introduced herself as a critic of the nudge method, she discussed both the pros and cons of nudging, and overall she presented nudging in a mostly favorable light. Osman has also written articles published by BBC and she has been featured as a guest on TV programs by BBC and Channel 4. In 2022 she was a guest on the YouTube channel of the rapper Zuby who has about 300,000 subscribers. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzReiyULjdM>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzReiyULjdM</a>]</p>
<p>Added in March 2025: Fenton published a Substack post about his involvement in the BBC documentary about climate change: <a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/climate-change-by-numbers-10-years.><a href="https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/climate-change-by-numbers-10-years" class="uri">https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/climate-change-by-numbers-10-years</a>.</a></p>
