<a href=#Video_of_Andrew_Bridgen_that_was_posted_by_multiple_accounts_promoted_by_bots id=Video_of_Andrew_Bridgen_that_was_posted_by_multiple_accounts_promoted_by_bots>Video
of Andrew Bridgen that was posted by multiple accounts promoted by
bots</a>
</h2>
<p>This video of Andrew Bridgen was posted by Wide Awake Media,
Concerned Citizen, Vigilant News, Vigilant Fox, Mario Nawfal, Jim
Ferguson, Robin Monotti, DD Denslow, David Wolfe, and David Cartland,
which are all accounts that seem to be frequently reposted by bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino-6.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>When I searched for a part of the text in Monotti's tweet in double
quotes, I noticed that the text but not the video had been posted by an
account called <a href=https://x.com/TimAino2>TimAino2</a>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In the past 24 hours TimAino2 had also retweeted or quote tweeted
Wide Awake Media, Radio Genoa, Aussie17, Truth Justice, Eva
Vlaardingerbroek, Concerned Citizen, and Peter Sweden (who happened to
post another video clip of Andrew Bridgen):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Two Miles Guo bots also linked to versions of the video that were
posted on GETTR (and the GETTR posts were made by two different users
but they still had the same text):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>When I searched for <code>lang:zh andrew bridgen</code>, many Guo bots
had posted a version of Bridgen's video with Chinese subtitles or quote
tweeted the video posted by Wide Awake Media or Vigilant Fox. A version
of Bridgen's video with Polish subtitles was also posted by an account
called himalayaespana6, which used to post in Spanish until 2023 but for
some reason now it posts in Polish instead:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Another Guo bot also posted a Spanish translation of Bridgen's
video:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-aino-5.jpg width=500>

<h2>
<a href=#Video_of_Mike_Yeadon_that_was_posted_14_times_by_Wide_Awake_Media id=Video_of_Mike_Yeadon_that_was_posted_14_times_by_Wide_Awake_Media>Video
of Mike Yeadon that was posted 14 times by Wide Awake Media</a>
</h2>
<p>Wide Awake Media posted this video of Mike Yeadon at least 14
times:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>The same video with a similar description was also posted by the
DiedSuddenly account, by Guo bots, and by Mercola's wife Erin Elizabeth
the Health Nut (who used to be advertised as the most expensive hooker
in Silicon Valley but who later evolved into a pimp who ran an operation
called EducatedEscort.com). The second-oldest tweet which matched a part
of the text of the tweet in double quotes was posted by Wide Awake
Media, but the oldest tweet was an English translation of a French tweet
that was posted by another bot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Many of the newest tweets by the French bot were about flat earth,
but one time it also posted a video by Greg Reese about how viruses have
not been isolated:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-4.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Among the 100 newest non-reply tweets by the bot which posted an
English translation of the French tweet, there were 5 retweets or quote
tweets of illuminatibot, 2 of Vigilant Fox, 2 of Wall Street Apes, 1 of
DR. Kek, and 1 of Visegrád 24:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-2.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>A Chinese bot posted two replies to ElonMuskAOC which included the
text of the video about Mike Yeadon but not the video. The Chinese bot
had 45 followers, but they included DR. Kek, and they included a fake
Elon Musk account with zero tweets called Elonmusk248058. The newest
non-reply tweets by the bot included a tweet about kalamari clots posted
by William Makis, a tweet by ElonMuskAOC about how Elon Musk was a
champion of free speech, Robin Monotti's tweet about Ryan Cole, three
anti-Muslim tweets by Radio Genoa, a retweet of a Chinese tweet that
quoted William Makis, a retweet of a Chinese account which quoted Shadow
of Ezra, two different retweets of Wall Street Silver which quoted
RadioGenoa, TheChiefNerd's clip of Tucker with Chinese subtitles, and so
on:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-5.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The Guo bot which posted Yeadon's video also posted a video by
aussie17 with Chinese subtitles, and it posted the same video of Andrew
Bridgen that was posted Wide Awake Media, Robin Monotti, Jim Ferguson,
Vigilant Fox, and Raelian bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-6.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>This Japanese bot was another account that posted the text of
Yeadon's quotation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wideawake-yeadon-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I scrolled through the newest tweets by the Japanese bot, within
a few pages it had reposted William Makis, Wall Street Silver, Peter
Sweden, Chuck Callesto, Simon Goddek, and Concerned Citizen:</p>
<div>

<div>
<img src=i/bot-elon-bx.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>I found that between April 6th UTC and April 30th UTC, Elon posted a
total of 22 replies or quote tweets which consisted only of the word
<span class="quote">"Exactly"</span> (even though one time he also added
an exclamation mark):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-elon-exactly.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>bx_on_x pointed out that Elon posted a large number of replies to the
accounts EndWokeness, Rothmus, MarioNawfal, and WallStreetSilv, but my
screenshot above also includes replies to Mario Nawfal and Wall Street
Silver.</p>
<p>My screenshot also shows that Elon posted multiple replies to the
account realchrisrufo. There were 56 tweets returned by the search
phrase <code>from:elonmusk to:realchrisrufo</code>. The text included 7
tweets that said only <span class="quote">"!"</span>, 6 <span
class="quote">"Yeah"</span> tweets, 4 <span class="quote">"Yes"</span>
tweets, 4 <span class="quote">"Wow"</span> tweets, 3 <span
class="quote">"Exactly"</span> tweets, and 1 <span
class="quote">"True"</span> tweet.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has posted 11 replies to Mario Nawfal which only consist of
an exclamation mark
(<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelonmusk+to%3Amarionawfal+%22!%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelonmusk+to%3Amarionawfal+%22!%22&amp;f=live</a>):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-elon-nawfal.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>In the past month Elon had posted a total of 44 tweets which
consisted only of the text <span class="quote">"Wow"</span>. They
included 3 replies to Mario Nawfal, 1 reply to Wall Streeet Silver, and
1 reply to Visegrad 24:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelonmusk+wow&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelonmusk+wow&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-elon-wow.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>I used code like this to scroll through Elon Musk's tweets with
replies and to count how many times each user was mentioned. It includes
replies and retweets but not quote tweets:</p>

<h2>
<a href=#Japanese_accounts_that_promote_Expose_News_author_Rhoda_Wilson id=Japanese_accounts_that_promote_Expose_News_author_Rhoda_Wilson>Japanese
accounts that promote Expose News author Rhoda Wilson</a>
</h2>
<p>Someone posted a link to an article at Expose News where the author
was listed as Rhoda Wilson, but most of the article was copied from the
blog of someone called <span class="quote">"A Lily Bit"</span> who
describes herself as a <span class="quote">"former intelligence
operative"</span>.
[<a href=https://expose-news.com/2024/05/02/russia-is-manipulated-by-the-same-interests/>https://expose-news.com/2024/05/02/russia-is-manipulated-by-the-same-interests/</a>]
I pointed out that Expose News was probably the same kind of
disinformation outlet as Red Voice Media, because both of them published
a large number of articles about stories that were covered on the Stew
Peters Network. Expose News has published articles by Rhoda Wilson which
said that COVID vaccines contained hydras, snake venom, and
self-assembling robot arms.
[<a href=https://expose-news.com/2021/12/23/pfizer-injection-contents-la-quinta-columna-confirms-findings-of-polish-scientist-and-dr-carrie-madej/>https://expose-news.com/2021/12/23/pfizer-injection-contents-la-quinta-columna-confirms-findings-of-polish-scientist-and-dr-carrie-madej/</a>,
<a href=https://expose-news.com/2022/04/15/snakes-spike-protein-injections-things-to-consider/>https://expose-news.com/2022/04/15/snakes-spike-protein-injections-things-to-consider/</a>,
<a href=https://expose-news.com/2022/10/28/nanostructures-in-covid-vaccines-are-not-self-assembling/>https://expose-news.com/2022/10/28/nanostructures-in-covid-vaccines-are-not-self-assembling/</a>]</p>
<p>When I searched for tweets about Rhoda Wilson, many of them linked to
Japanese translations of her articles:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rhoda-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Content associated with the Stew Peters Network is often translated
to many foreign languages, similar to content related to Q, Miles Guo,
Falun Gong, and GAIA TV. I have also found multiple Chinese websites
which publish translations of articles by people like Benjamin Fulford,
COBRA, Corey Goode, David Wilcock, Michael Salla, and X22 Report.
[<a href=https://www.pfcchina.org/xinrenyuedu/47547.html>https://www.pfcchina.org/xinrenyuedu/47547.html</a>,
<a href=https://blog.xuite.net/tonycjones/twblog/589528235>https://blog.xuite.net/tonycjones/twblog/589528235</a>,
<a href=https://jonhson-hsu.blogspot.com/2020/12/blog-post_82.html>https://jonhson-hsu.blogspot.com/2020/12/blog-post_82.html</a>]
So when I looked up the newest tweets by one of the bots which had
linked to a Japanese translation of an article by Rhoda Wilson, I was
not surprised that it promoted videos and blog posts by Benjamin
Fulford. It also promoted articles by the Japanese edition of Epoch
Times, and it reposted McCullough Foundation and BRICS News. It also
reposted the same video clip of Andrew Bridgen I mentioned in an earlier
section of this file that was posted by Wide Awake Media, Jim Ferguson,
Robin Monotti, and Vigilant Fox. And it posted a guide on how to remove
graphene from your body:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rhoda-2.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>When I looked up another account called tnuu0310 that linked to an
article by Rhoda Wilson, most of its tweets were in Japanese so it
hadn't reposted that many English-language accounts. But it had
retweeted a tweet about flat earth by DR. Kek, and it had reposted 3
different tweets by Insider Paper. It also retweeted a link to an
article by aussie17, and it retweeted a quote tweet of a video by
aussie17 that was posted by Concerned Citizen:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rhoda-3.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>I also found a website which had posted Czech translations of many
articles by Rhoda Wilson.
[<a href=https://pravednes.cz/WilsonRhoda.profil>https://pravednes.cz/WilsonRhoda.profil</a>]</p>
<p>I didn't find any photo of Rhoda Wilson or any video or podcast where
she appeared, so she might be a fake persona similar to Heshmat Alavi
and Tyler Durden. According to a report titled <span class="quote">"GEC
Special Report: Russia's Pillars of Disinformation and
Propaganda"</span>, <span class="quote">"<em>Global Research</em>
published or republished seven authors attributed by Facebook to be
false online personas created by The Main Directorate of the General
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, popularly known as
the GRU. Sophie Mangal, Anna Jaunger, Milko Pejovic, Adomas Abromaitis,
Mariam al-Hijab, Said al-Khalaki and Mehmet Ersoy were identified by
Facebook as false online personas created by the GRU, as noted in
<a href=https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/publication/potemkin-think-tanks>Potemkin
Pages &amp; Personas: Assessing GRU Online Operations, 2014-2019</a> by
Renee DiResta and Shelby Grossman, published by the Stanford Internet
Observatory in November 2019.105 Altogether, these seven GRU personas
are responsible for 108 articles that appear on Global Research's
website."</span>

However Global Research has also republished many articles by Rhoda
Wilson (even though the original source of the articles was always
linked as Expose News, or in two cases the source was linked as Health
Canada News which had copied their article from Expose News).
[<a href=https://www.globalresearch.ca/author/rhoda-wilson>https://www.globalresearch.ca/author/rhoda-wilson</a>]</p>
<p>Expose News publishes an average of about two articles per day where
the author is listed as Rhoda Wilson. In all of the most recent articles
by Expose News, the author is listed as either Rhoda Wilson, Patricia
Harrity, or The Exposé. When I searched Google and DuckDuckGo for
<code>site:expose-news.com/author</code>, I found that up to February
2022 many articles also had the author <span
class="quote">"captaindaretofly"</span>, and there's a total of two
articles where the author is listed as Carolyn Marie Peterson, but I
didn't find any other authors on their website.
[<a href=https://expose-news.com/author/captaindaretofly/>https://expose-news.com/author/captaindaretofly/</a>,
<a href=https://expose-news.com/author/carolynmariepeterson/>https://expose-news.com/author/carolynmariepeterson/</a>]
I didn't find information about captaindaretofly apart from their
articles at Expose News.</p>
<p>Patricia Harrity's profile picture at Expose News shows that her
username at Gravatar is triciarococo.
[<a href=https://expose-news.com/author/patricia-harrity/>https://expose-news.com/author/patricia-harrity/</a>]
When I googled for the username, the only result was that someone with
the email address triciarococo@gmail.com from the city of Lowestoft in
England was a <span class="quote">"brigade member"</span> at the Tony
Robbins Foundation.
[<a href=https://www.thetonyrobbinsfoundation.org/brigade/lowestoft/>https://www.thetonyrobbinsfoundation.org/brigade/lowestoft/</a>]
When I googled for <code>"Patricia Harrity" "Lowestoft"</code>, I found
a LinkedIn profile of a Patricia Harrity from Lowestoft who had the same
profile picture as the author at Expose News, and who had earlier worked
as a proprietror at a company called Rococo.
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-harrity-frsa-9482545a>https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-harrity-frsa-9482545a</a>]
So I guess at least Patricia Harrity might be a real person:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-expose-1.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>There were over 2,000 results when I googled for
<code>site:genkimaru1.livedoor.blog "rhoda wilson"</code> and over 1,000
results when I googled for
<code>site:genkimaru1.livedoor.blog "patricia harrity"</code>. So I guess
the reason why so many of the tweets that mentioned Rhoda Wilson were in
Japanese is that a huge number of her articles have been translated to
Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese translations of articles by Expose News were mostly
posted by the blogs genkimaru1.livedoor.blog and
glassbead.blog.shinobi.jp. They also post articles by Baxter Dmitry, who
writes for The People's Voice. When I searched Twitter for the name
Baxter Dmitry, about half of the most recent search results were posted
by the same Japanese accounts which promoted articles by Rhoda Wilson
(which are likely bots but I'm not sure):

<p>In the year 2023 Expose News claimed that there was an assassination
attempt on their editor, so they used it as a pretext for a fundraiser
where they managed to reach 96% of their goal (even though they didn't
even mention who their editor is, or how their editor had been injured):
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514174945/https://expose-news.com/2023/05/14/the-expose-may-fundraising-campaign/>https://web.archive.org/web/20230514174945/https://expose-news.com/2023/05/14/the-expose-may-fundraising-campaign/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Establishment has escalated its attempts to silence us for good.
The Exposé was already facing an unprecedented level of censorship and
access to our funds was restricted.</p>
<p>But due to the constant failure to silence us the Establishment
recently tried to fatally injure our Editor so they could silence us for
good.</p>
<p>Thankfully, their latest attempt failed but it was not without
consequence and our Editor is now recovering from severe injuries
sustained and watching from afar.</p>
<p>This means your support is now more vital than ever so that The

<p>Andrew Bridgen posted this video clip with no source cited, so when I

had been posted by Wide Awake Media and by illuminatibot twice (but none
of them cited any source for the video):</p>

<p>Later the same video was also posted by Wall Street Silver.

<p>The bot below also posted the same video in a reply to Peter Sweden.
Most posts by the bot were written in English, but it sometimes randomly
also posted tweets in other languages like Korean and Turkish. Out of
the latest tweets its timeline, about 40% of the tweets were reposts of
nature photos by Japanese accounts and about 20% of tweets promoted
Islam, or in particular a messianic figure called Imam Mahdi. (I think
these bots are assigned interests they post about randomly, so sometimes
they end up picking unlikely combinations of interests, like how I also
found a bot which posted about both Tanzanian topics and Anonymous.)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gates-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The video of Bill Gates was also posted by the Japanese bot below. It
had recently reposted Shadow of Ezra, Eva Vlaardingerbroek, Wide Awake
Media, Mario Nawfal, Wall Street Silver, illuminatibot, bambkb, Peter
Sweden, Insider Paper, Concerned Citizen, and BRICS News. It also
tweeted the same video of Andrew Bridgen that was tweeted by a huge
number of bots, and it posted an original tweet where it promoted Peter
Sweden:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gates-3.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The video by Wide Awake Media was also quoted by Alex Jones, who
misspelled Josef Mengele's name as <span class="quote">"Joseph

15 accounts which had posted a translation of Alex's tweet in various

</div>
<p>The French, Spanish, and Portuguese accounts hadn't reposted that
many English-language tweets, so they also hadn't posted that many
tweets from the usual suspects, but the German, Chinese, and Turkish
accounts had. When I looked up the other account which had posted a
German translation of the tweet, about 30% of its latest tweets were
reposts of tweets by English-language accounts, but the majority of them
were reposts of RadioGenoa, Jim Ferguson, Wide Awake Media,
illuminatibot, End Wokeness, Oli London, Alex Jones, or Wall Street
Silver:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gates-5.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The account which had posted a Chinese translation of the tweet by
Alex Jones was a Miles Guo bot called
<a href=https://x.com/Lhcychchvk4567/>Helen777</a>. Its three latest
tweets were quote tweets of illuminatibot, thehealthb0t, and nikola 3
(and the tweet by nikola 3 was about flat earth):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gates-6.jpg width=500>

<p>Its 7th-newest tweet was a video of Miles Guo that was posted by
Concerned Citizen:</p>

<p>When I scrolled through the timeline of the bot and counted how many
times it had retweeted or quote tweeted each user, most of the accounts
with 5 or more retweets were Guo bots (or some may have been non-bot
accounts that promoted Guo), but the two highest-ranking users were
illuminatibot and Concerned Citizen:</p>

<p>The reposts by Alex Jones might be automated similar to reposts by
Liz Gunn and Elon Musk, because here within 3 days Alex Jones had
reposted Mario Nawfal 7 times, illuminatibot 4 times, Radio Genoa 3
times, Wide Awake Media twice, and one times each of Stew Peters,
Concerned Citizen, Jackson Hinkle, and Liz Churchill (or alternatively
it might be that these accounts are shown in the <span
class="quote">"For you"</span> feed, and Alex or the people who run his
account just repost tweets from the <span class="quote">"For you"</span>
feed):</p>
<div>

course be lying):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-alexjones-4.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Like Elon Musk, the account of Alex Jones also seems to post one or
more tweets almost every waking hour. But when I scraped the 1,000
newest tweets by Alex Jones with retweets excluded, there were actually
many waking hours when he posted zero tweets (even though I would've
gotten rid of a lot of the gaps if I would've also included retweets,
but the web GUI doesn't show the time when a user retweeted a tweet, and
the API is now so expensive that I can't afford to use it):</p>

<p>Camus is one of the accounts that is most often reposted by Alex
Jones. It started tweeting in 2019, but a large percentage of its early
tweets were links to infowars.com:</p>

<a href=#Radio_Genoa id=Radio_Genoa>Radio Genoa</a>
</h2>
<p>The Radio Genoa account is not necessarily a bot, but it seems to be
heavily reposted by bot accounts.</p>
<p>An article about Radio Genoa said this in German: <span
class="quote">"Contrary to what the name suggests, Radio Genoa is not a
radio station, but a digital platform that is present everywhere, on
TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and on X (formerly Twitter.) [...] The NZZ was
unable to clarify who is behind Radio Genoa. The operator has erased
most of his previous traces on the Internet, but some have been
preserved. He presumably lives in Italy and has operated numerous
profiles, including as <span class="quote">'DJ Lebois'</span> and <span
class="quote">'Antonio Zena'</span>. His original Twitter profile was
called Antonio_zena76, which could indicate that he was born in
1976."</span>

<p>The Italian articles shown below said that Antonio Quinto changed his
username from AntonioDvx to RadioSavana and that RadioGenova was a new
account of RadioSavana. In 2021 the RadioSavana account announced that
it had gone into retirement and new tweets would be posted under
RadioGenova. And the username of RadioGenova was later changed to
RadioGenoa:

<p>When I searched Twitter for <code>@antonio_zena76</code>, it showed a
bunch of old replies to the account that is now called RadioGenova, and
it included a screenshot of a tweet by antonio_zena76 where the display
name was Antonio Zena Quinto.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%40antonio_zena76&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%40antonio_zena76&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>The name Antonio Quinto is probably also a pseudonym, because one
article said this in Dutch: <span class="quote">"We found a Facebook
account of the same name with the same pseudonym <span
class="quote">'Antonio Quinto'</span>. An email address is linked to
this account that gives us a new name. We have chosen not to share this
name because (as far as we know) he has not done anything criminal. In
addition, we do not know whether he is solely responsible for the
account. The name does not lead us directly to a social media account of
this person, but we do find a sister of Antonio on Facebook and
Instagram. The latter social media platform in particular appears to be
a source of information. Between 2017 and 2019, Antonio's sister shared
several photos of herself with her brother. As we look at the photos,
something stands out. In an Instagram photo, where the family is sitting
together on the couch, a location is tagged: Quinto al Mare, a
neighborhood in the east of Genoa. The pseudonym Antonio Quinto
therefore appears to refer to a residential area."</span>

<p>In the last 48 hours all tweets by the account RadioGenova were

</h2>
<p>When I searched for tweets about the Expose News author Rhoda Wilson,
I found that a user called
<a href=https://x.com/fukky322563>fukky322563</a> had posted a large
number of links to Japanese translations of her articles:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fukky-rhoda.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>fukky322563 followed only 14 accounts, but they included accounts
whose bios mentioned New Age concepts like 5D ascension and starseeds
(the screenshot is translated from Japanese):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fukky-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>fukky322563 also followed an account called <span
class="quote">"Tomoko from the 444th generation"</span> and a bot which
reposted Tomoko's tweets. Tomoko seems to have started a New Age
religious movement with elements similar to Benjamin Fulford and
COBRA:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-tomoko-fukky.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Tomoko is always conveying information from sources who she calls
<span class="quote">"princesses"</span>, like H-hime, N-hime, Y-hime,
and Hoshihime. In one thread she conveyed information from <span
class="quote">"Princess H-hime"</span> who is a member of the H family
which rules the world.
[<a href=https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1772266577162817731>https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1772266577162817731</a>]
In another tweet Tomoko was conveying information from Princess N, who
belongs to the N family which is one of the world's leading intelligence
families.
[<a href=https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1780217657154805976>https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1780217657154805976</a>]
(Benjamin Fulford has also said that he gets intel from Princess Kaoru
Nakamaru, who claims to be the granddaughter of the Emperor Meiji.)</p>
<p>Tomoko also speaks of <span class="quote">"the cabal"</span> (which
is a term that Benjamin Fulford used before Q existed):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-tomoko-cabal.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Tomoko uses the term <span class="quote">"J daya"</span> (Ｊダヤ) to
refer to Jews but <span class="quote">"GOEM"</span> (ＧＯＥＭ) as the
good force which is opposed to the <span class="quote">"J daya"</span>.
So the word GOEM probably means goyim, which is written as <span
class="quote">"goimu"</span> in Japanese, because the word GOEM is
pronounced in Japanese as <span class="quote">"goemu"</span>. The
Japanese word for Jews is <span class="quote">"yudaya"</span>
(ユダヤ).</p>
<p>Tomoko is always transmitting information from GOEM which is a secret
organization of white hats, which is reminiscent of how Benjamin Fulford
is conveying information from the White Dragon Society and Jason Shurka
claims that he was selected to be a representative of The Light System.
(But Shurka and Fulford are both Jews, so it's interesting that Tomoko
is also concerned with Jewish issues.)</p>
<p>Tomoko also speaks about how there will be mass arrests of cabal
members in the future, which is another thing that Benjamin Fulford was
writing about before there was Q. In one tweet Tomoko wrote this in
Japanese: <span class="quote">"GOEM Political Department: When the hunt
for the J-Day Financial Devil begins in Europe and America, all of the
J-Day Financial Devil's minions will be arrested. At that time, many
arrests will be made from both the Democratic Party and the Republican
Party in the United States. Eventually, both the Democratic Party and
the Republican Party will split, and the two-party system will
disappear."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1783107740690489391>https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1783107740690489391</a>]</p>
<p>Tomoko also teaches that Japanese people are the true Israelites:
<span class="quote">"GOEM History Department: In our opinion, it was not
Jesus who came to Japan, but the descendants of Moses. The teachings of
ancient Israel continue today in Japan."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1782027715400655054>https://x.com/UF_dynasty/status/1782027715400655054</a>]</p>
<p>Tomoko's tweets seemed to consistently get around 2-10 replies, so I
looked up a random account which had replied to one of her tweets. It
was called gomachan4_gou, and I found that it had retweeted quote tweets
of nikola 3, TheChiefNerd, Wall Street Silver, BRICS News, and Insider
Paper. And it had also retweeted a link to an article about Eva
Vlaardingerboek, and it retweeted a video by The People's Voice with
Japanese subtitles, and it retweeted a video of the former Pfizer
employee Melissa McAtee who first came out as a whistleblower on Project
Veritas, and it retweeted a video by some western guy that was posted by
Himalaya Japan, and it retweeted an Epoch Times video that was posted by
Vigilant Fox, and it retweeted an Epoch Times interview of the snake
venom guy Bryan Ardis, and one time it retweeeted 15 tweets by Tomoko in
a row:

<div>
<img src=i/bot-tomoko-ubi.jpg width=1500>

<p>The image above also shows that gomachan4_gou retweeted an account
called teruko_JMYG_bot, but its bio says that it's a bot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-teruko-bio.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>So I guess Tomoko might also be a bot (in which case her religious
movement might even be the world's first religions whose leader is a
bot).</p>
<p>Like Tomoko, Teruko also says that there will be mass arrests of the
cabal: <span class="quote">"It is safe to assume that the fight against
the Cabal by Earthling forces will end in victory with the realization
of peace on the continent. After the Alliance's victory on the
continent, the Cabal's mass arrests and military court trials will be
made public, and a new financial system will be implemented from a
humanitarian perspective."</span>

<p>Teruko also published a blog post where she predicted that there
would be a cataclysmic pole shift.
[<a href=https://note.com/teruko_jmyg/n/ncb0a8ba1e472>https://note.com/teruko_jmyg/n/ncb0a8ba1e472</a>]
It reminded me of a Japanese cult called Pana Wave, which mixed elements
of Theosophy, Christianity, and western conspiracy culture, because they
also predicted that there would be a pole shift on May 15th 2003.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pana_Wave>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pana_Wave</a>]</p>
<p>Teruko often retweets accounts which quote her tweets. One of the
accounts has the word UBI in its display name, similar to the account
gomachan4_gou whose display name includes the word UBI. Matthew North
pointed out that Joe Rogan was always asking his guests what they
thought about UBI, which made it seem like familiarizing his audience
with UBI may have been a part of the agenda that Rogan was given by his
handlers, but maybe these bots are similarly trying to get Japanese
people familiar with the concept of UBI:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-tomoko-ubi2.jpg width=600>

<p>Here an account replied to Tomoko by quoted a tweet by Teruko which
said that the Gnostics were an enemy faction of Trump:

<p>Here Teruko said that she had signed the release of over 40
femtillion yen (which is reminiscent of Benjamin Fulford's stories about
huge secret financial transactions):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-tomoko-teruko-3.jpg width=600>

<p>Teruko also has a YouTube channel which consists of videos that are
spoken in a TTS voice by a VTuber-style 2d character:

<p>Tomoko has also posted many replies to Teruko, which I guess makes it
seem even more likely that Tomoko is also a bot:</p>

<p>Another account which was followed by fukky322563 is callled
Dharainyara. It said that Trump's cleaning the swamp was prophesied in
the Bible, and it said that the white hats were working together with
Putin's troops to do a mass arrest of the bad guys:</p>

<p>When I looked up tweets by the bot which posted a reply to Tomoko

Peter Sweden, Eva Vlaardingerboek, Insider Paper, Jack Straw, Concerned

<a href=#Insider_Paper id=Insider_Paper>Insider Paper</a>
</h2>
<p>Among the Twitter accounts that are most frequently reposted by the
bots I have been researching on this page, there's a couple of accounts
that are presented as news outlets, like Insider Paper, Radio Genoa, and
BRICS News (even though Radio Genoa is not an actual radio station, and
BRICS News seems to have a limited presence outside of Twitter and
Telegram). But Insider Paper is not just a Twitter account but it's also
a blog that exists outside of Twitter.</p>
<p>The author of most articles at Insider Paper seems to be listed as
AFP, which is a press service similar to AP, and the same articles have
also been posted on multiple other websites. But in original articles by
Insider Paper, the authors include
<a href=https://insiderpaper.com/disease-x-poses-threat-of-a-deadlier-pandemic-warn-covid-experts/>Brendan

</div>
<p>The about page of Insider Paper features 6 of the authors shown
above.
[<a href=https://insiderpaper.com/about/>https://insiderpaper.com/about/</a>]
The first person listed is Michelle DeBoer-Jones, who also has a
LinkedIn profile which says that she currently works as a writer for 4
different companies, but i doesn't mention Insider Paper:
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-jones-writer/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-jones-writer/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-insider-linkedin.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The bio of Sheeraz Raza says that he is the founder of Insider Paper.
He also seems like a real person, because he has pages at LinkedIn,
Twitter, Instagram, and Medium.
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheerazraza/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheerazraza/</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/SheerazRaza>https://x.com/SheerazRaza</a>,

<a href=https://medium.com/%40SheerazRaza>https://medium.com/%40SheerazRaza</a>]
His LinkedIn profile says that from 2011 to 2020 he served as the <span
class="quote">"chief operations officer"</span> at a company called
ValueWalk, but the profile of Michelle DeBoer-Jones also says that she
has worked for ValueWalk Premium from 2012 to the present. Sheeraz Raza
is probably Pakistani, because he posted a photo of a Pakistani flag on
Instagram and wrote <span class="quote">"We Bleed Green. 🇵🇰 Long Live
Pakistan."</span>
[<a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmbb7cEBRN_/>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmbb7cEBRN_/</a>]</p>
<p>LinkedIn shows that other people who have worked for Insider Paper
are from the Dominican Republic, Pakistan, and Nigeria (but their
profiles are not visible to my account):
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=%22insider%20paper%22>https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=%22insider%20paper%22</a>]</p>

<div>
<img src=i/bot-insider-1.jpg width=300>

<p>Zamir Ahmed Awan seems be a real person, because there's videos of
his interviews on YouTube, and he also has a blog on the website of the
Russian International Affairs Council:

<p>When I searched Twitter for <code>lang:fi miles guo</code>, there were
only a total of 8 results but the 2 newest tweets were posted by an
account called MargitKarvonen2 which seems likely to be a bot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-figuo-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Within the past 24 hours, the account had reposted Vigilant Fox 6
times, Concerned Citizen 5 times, Peter McCullough 5 times, Liz

Malhotra twice, and one time each of nikola 3, aussie17, Wall Street

<div>
<img src=i/bot-figuo-2.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Here MargitKarvonen2 posted a Finnish translation of a post by
illuminatibot which contained an Amazon affiliate link for a brand of
soap:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-figuo-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Here the Finnish account posted a machine translation of a tweet by
Liz Churchill in broken Finnish, which said that dental anesthetic
contained graphene oxide:
[<a href=https://x.com/MargitKarvonen2/status/1790024362340258277>https://x.com/MargitKarvonen2/status/1790024362340258277</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-figuo-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>It's like they are generating these stories with a random generator.
In 2023 Sasha Latypova did a Zoom video with Shimon Yanowitz and David
Nixon where they claimed that dental anesthetic contained hydrogel.
Latypova's blog post about the video said: <span class="quote">"Shimon
Yanowitz, a researcher from Israel joined me and David on a zoom call to
observe in real time what happens with a common dental anesthetic
injectable under microscope. The brand of anesthetic is Septodont and
the product name is Lignospan. David placed a drop of it on a microscope
slide and simply observed as it was drying. The process revealed that
the substance is likely hydrogel due to the <span
class="quote">'bubbling'</span> phenomenon as it dries. The process
becomes more energetic when a cellphone is placed next to the
sample."</span>
[<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under</a>]
In 2021 when Karen Kingston did her alt media debut on the Stew Peters
Show (and a bit earlier on the Doug Billings Show which is aired on the
same cable TV channel as Stew's show), her big revelation was that COVID
vaccines contain graphene oxide and hydrogel.
[<a href=https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/>https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/</a>]
I believe Latypova also did her alt media debut when she appeared on the
Stew Peters Show in 2022.</p>
<p>Apparently the graphene oxide was discovered through <span
class="quote">"torsion spectroscopy"</span> by some Polish lady who
invented torsion spectroscopy. She had previously done <span
class="quote">"groundbreaking research that the antimatter self of Covid
19 injected individuals is being altered"</span> and that kalamari clots
contain prion-like proteins. Ana Maria Mihalcea wrote

<p>An account called masalayno was reposted by the Finnish account
margitkarvonen2 that posted about Miles Guo. One of its most recent
tweets was about kalamari clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In the past week it had also reposted Peter Sweden 5 times, Wide
Awake Media 5 times, nikola 3 three times, and one time each of Peter
McCullough, redpillb0t, Concerned Citizen, Simon Goddek, and Liz
Churchill:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-2.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The Finnish account retweeted an account called Suviquu1 that quoted
illuminatibot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The account called Suviquu1 used the profile picture of a Finnish
person I know whose name is actually Suvi, but I think it's an old
Instagram photo which has now been deleted.
[<a href=https://www.instagram.com/suvi.tuulija/>https://www.instagram.com/suvi.tuulija/</a>]
In one tweet Suviquu1 posted a screenshot of a post by a different
person named Suvi from Facebook and claimed it was its own post, even
though the person whose photo was included next to the Facebook post was
clearly a different person than the person in the profile picture.
[<a href=https://x.com/Suviquu1/status/1791889542867259854>https://x.com/Suviquu1/status/1791889542867259854</a>,
<a href=https://archive.is/TyICQ>https://archive.is/TyICQ</a>] (Or the
screenshot of the Facebook post may have been fake and not an actual
screenshot, because I didn't find the original Facebook post or the user
on Facebook.)</p>
<p>In the past 48 hours Suviquu1 had reposted Concerned Citizen 4 times,
Simon Goddek 4 times, David Cartland 3 times, illuminatibot twice,
redpillb0t twice, and one time each of conspiracyb0t, Wide Awake Media,
DiedSuddenly, and David Wolfe:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-4.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Suviquu1 had also posted multiple replies to illuminatibot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Here Suviquu1 first retweeted a quote tweet of video of Bill Gates
and then quoted the same video itself (which is a common pattern among
these bots). The same video of Bill Gates was also posted by Andrew
Bridgen, illuminatibot, Wide Awake Media, Wall Street Silver,
IlluminatiCoin, and Alex Jones:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-6.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Suviquu1 posted this image of its Twitter circle, where the inner
circle includes 4 different IlluminatiCoin bots, Wide Awake Media, and
David Cartland. The middle circle includes Wall Street Silver and DR.
Kek. The outer circle includes Concerned Citizen. And many of the other
accounts in the image are Finnish accounts which operate under a similar
formula as Suviquu1 and which seem to be bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Suviquu1 even has two imaginary sons. One of them was diagnosed with
Tourette's syndrome, he has been on SSRIs, he is unemployed, and he
receives a housing benefit. The other son turned 12 in September 2023,
he goes to the gym, and he used to be on a soccer team for which the bot
received a social benefit. Suviquu1 has posted multiple tweets which
support a consistent story about its sons, even though the real person
named Suvi whose photo the account is using doesn't seem to have any
children:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-9.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The first two non-retweet tweets by Suviquu1 were both replies to
conspiracyb0t:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-11.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I noticed that an account called
<a href=https://x.com/AriMantyne35946>AriMantyne35946</a> had posted a
reply to Suviquu1. In the past month he had posted 6 quote tweets of
Suviquu1, and he hadn't reposted that many English tweets, but they
still included tweets of Vigilant Fox, Peter Sweden, Concerned Citizen,
David Cartland, Liz Churchill, and Aseem Malhotra:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-10.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/Susan__Laine>Susan__Laine</a> is another
Finnish account which seems like a bot, and which primarily posts about
COVID and which has a Finnish flag in its display name like Suviquu1.
Its three most recent tweets were a retweet of a quote tweet of Peter
McCullough, a retweet of Suviquu1, and a retweet of a tweet about
kalamari clots by Concerned Citizen:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-fi-12.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>When I picked up a random account from the followers of Susan__Laine,
within the past week it had reposted redpillb0t, Concerned Citizen,
Radio Genoa, Wide Awake Media, William Makis, Peter Sweden,
illuminatibot, Liz Churchill, TheChiefNerd, ElonMuskAOC,
TheFlatEartherr, and Wall Street Silver:

clots:</p>
<div>

<p>The image above shows that the display name of the account which

<p>When I searched for a part of the text of one of David Wolfe's tweets
in double quotes, I found that similar tweets had been posted by three
other accounts (except there were slight variations in the text of the
tweets, like they said <span class="quote">"w"</span> instead of <span
class="quote">"with"</span>, or they were written in lowercase instead
of uppercase, or they included an emoji at the end):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I looked up tweets by the account
<a href=https://x.com/mjm3j>mjm3j</a> shown above, about half of its
tweets were in Arabic and half in English, but its 8 newest tweets still
included 3 reposts of Concerned Citizen and one repost of
conspiracyb0t.</p>
<p>David Wolfe was already a flat earther in 2015 (which was the year
when the modern flat earth movement started, and before 2015 virtually
no-one in alt media was saying that the earth was flat):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe posted this video about flat earth which had also been
posted by many other accounts with similar text:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-4.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>This guy said that his <span class="quote">"For you"</span> feed was
showing tweets by Stew Peters, illuminatibot, DR. Kek, TheFlatEartherr,
and David Wolfe. All of them apart from possibly illuminatibot have said
that the earth is flat (even though IlluminatiCoin's Linktree page has a
link to blog posts written by someone called Operation Q who has
promoted flat earth):
[<a href=https://x.com/A0iYT/status/1708504904141017298>https://x.com/A0iYT/status/1708504904141017298</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-16.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I'm not sure if David Wolfe has said that viruses do not exist, which
is a common view among flat earthers. He tweeted a video clip where
Robert Young said that viruses have never been isolated. But on the
other hand he is selling a silver product which he claims neutralizes
viruses, and he also posted an affiliate link for an air pufifier which
he said stopped viruses.
[<a href=https://x.com/DavidWolfe/status/1734705523612582190>https://x.com/DavidWolfe/status/1734705523612582190</a>,

He tweeted the video of Robert Young twice with the identical text more
than a year apart, but the tweets may have been automated because
similar tweets were also posted by dozens of other accounts:
[<a href=https://x.com/DavidWolfe/status/1620377641554690049>https://x.com/DavidWolfe/status/1620377641554690049</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe posted this video of the Pfizer whistleblower Melissa
McAtee, but the text of his tweet was identical to the first sentence of
a tweet that was posted about 5 hours earlier by an account called
zakisolja:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The same video clip of Melissa McAtee was also posted by Wide Awake
Media and Shadow of Ezra. It was also posted by Simone Gold, who is a
Jew who founded America's Frontline Doctors, which had a news team based
in Israel that was ran by the Kahanist Chabadnik Mordechai Sones. And
the video was posted by HopeGirl, who came to the defense of The
Wellness Company after it was exposed as a likely intelligence operation
by Kristin Elizabeth. HopeGirl also claimed that she had developed a

<p>When I searched for <code>lang:ko melissa mcatee</code>, the only
result was a tweet posted by a Raelian bot called Raelian Amor:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-10.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In May 2024 McAtee also did an interview with Jim Ferguson where she
said that COVID vaccines contain Luciferase:
[<a href=https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1794314557705351356>https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1794314557705351356</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-mcatee-luciferace.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>An account called zakisolja had posted the same video of Melissa
McAtee as David Wolfe where one sentence in their tweets was identical.
In the past 48 hours it had reposted Wall Street Apes, Mario Nawfal,
Concerned Citizen, Oli London, Ansastasia Maria Loupis, Wall Street
Silver, and Radio Genoa:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-8.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>zakisolja had also reposted a video about kalamari clots from
InfoWars, which was posted by an account called Camus (which I haven't
mentioned that often on this page, but which is often reposted by bots,
and which is often also reposted by Alex Jones):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-9.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe also tweeted this video which had been tweeted by three
other accounts with similar text before his account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-12.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe posted a tweet which simply said <span
class="quote">"What celebrity do you no longer like because you found
out they're actually a bad person?"</span> It reminded me of all of the
random questions that are asked by Elon Musk fan bots and DR. Kek. When
I searched for a part of the text in double quotes, I noticed that a
similar tweet had been posted by David Wolfe's account two months
earlier, and similar tweets had also been posted by at least 8 other
accounts (but the tweets had slight variations, so that for example some
tweets used the word <span class="quote">"which"</span> in place of the
word <span class="quote">"what"</span> or they included an emoji at the
end of the tweet):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-13.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe posted two tweets which said <span class="quote">"Let's
start a thread of random advice. No specific topics, just great
advice."</span> Similar tweets had been posted earlier by hundreds of
bot accounts.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22start+a+thread+of+random+advice.+No+specific%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22start+a+thread+of+random+advice.+No+specific%22&amp;f=live</a>]
Wall Street Silver posted an image that contained similar text (which I
think increases the likelihood that Wall Street Silver is also a bot or
a human-bot hybrid):
[<a href=https://x.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1745702153006743983>https://x.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1745702153006743983</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-15.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>When I searched for <code>lang:fi to:davidwolfe</code>, I found two
Finnish accounts that had posted a reply to David Wolfe. But both
accounts had recently also retweeted the account Suviquu1 which had also
recently reposted David Wolfe:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-18.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>David Wolfe's account posts these random questions about once per
day, and around half of the time an identical question has been posted
earlier by other accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-19.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>I also found that a Miles Guo bot called
<a href=https://x.com/Freda8991>Freda8991</a> seems to post many of the
same videos as David Wolfe's account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolfe-20.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>David Cartland is another person like David Wolfe who is heavily
promoted by bots and who posts similar junk conspiracy content and a lot
of video clips. But his bio used to say <span class="quote">"Managed
account by PR team"</span> for a while until December 2024, but the text
had been removed by January 2025. Snapshots of his account at the
Wayback Machine were not functional, but I found the text mentioned on a
website which had copied his bio from Twitter:
[<a href=https://xbase.so/CartlandDavid>https://xbase.so/CartlandDavid</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-cartland-managed.png width=400>
</div>
<p>So I don't know if Wolfe's account is similarly ran by some PR team
that has hooked it up to some bot software. I imagine there's some
agencies or contractors which have software for running these Twitter
accounts in a semi-automated way.</p>

<p>Many Guo bots posted this infographic which says that <span

that was posted by Wall Street Silver:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>This video of Yeadon was posted by a user with a Guy Fawkes avatar
(like how the original trutherbot account also had a Guy Fawkes avatar).
The bio of the user linked to a page for Foolmich's grand jury, its
pinned tweet was a thread about Foolmich, and it also advertised
Foolmich's Telegram page:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-yeadon-7.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The 4 newest tweets by the Guy Fawkes account included reposts of
Wall Street Silver, Robin Monotti, and Concerned citizen, and within the
next few pages it had also reposted Andrew Bridgen, Wide Awake Media,
Vigilant Fox, aussie17, DiedSuddenly, and DD Denslow:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-yeadon-6.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>When I searched for <code>lang:ko mike yeadon</code>, the results
included a total of 9 quote tweets of Wide Awake Media, 2 of
illuminatibot, 1 of Wall Street Apes, and 1 of Liz Churchill.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=mike+yeadon+lang%3Ako&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=mike+yeadon+lang%3Ako&amp;f=live</a>]

<p><a href=https://x.com/prof_freedom>prof_freedom</a> is a German
account that primarily posts about COVID and that currently has about
70,000 followers. It has now changed its profile picture, but
conspirator0 found that its old profile picture was generated by GAN:
[<a href=https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1569083049710592004>https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1569083049710592004</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meet <span class="citation"
data-cites="prof_freedom">@prof_freedom</span> , a Twitter account with
49,000 followers (including Sebastian Gorka) and a black-and-white
GAN-generated face. #SundayShenaniGANs</p>
<p>(GAN = <span class="quote">"generative adversarial network"</span>,
the AI technique used by tools like
<a href=https://thispersondoesnotexist.com>https://thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-1.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>One fingerprint of unmodified GAN-generated faces (at least, those
made with widely-available tools) is that the major facial features
(especially eyes) are in the same location on every image. This becomes
obvious when one blends multiple GAN-generated faces together.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-5.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>There are other signs that <span class="citation"
data-cites="prof_freedom">@prof_freedom</span> 's profile image is not a
real photograph of a person's face. The most obvious is the unrealistic
teeth; there are also some strange things going on where the hair meets
the background.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-2.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Update #3: The <span class="citation"

suspension, but is no longer using the GAN-generated face. Hilariously,
the first two accounts they thanked for their return to Twitter both
have GAN-generated faces.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The account holmenkollin is now called
<a href=https://x.com/corona_realism>corona_realism</a> and it no longer
has a GAN-generated avatar. All three accounts posts in German and
they're focused on COVID:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>ProfFreedom and MrsMertes had recently retweeeted accounts called
<a href=https://x.com/tom_zeh>tom_zeh</a> and
<a href=https://x.com/SoniaMarima>SoniaMarima</a> which also appear to
have GAN-generated avatars similar to the images generated by
thispersondoesnotexist.com:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-9.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In the avatar of tom_zeh, the background looks pasted in because the
lighting doesn't seem to match the face. And the outline of the hair
against the sky looks like it has a feather of a few pixels. The glasses
have a reflection that looks like some kind of a screen that is off to
the side, but why would there be a screen to the side in a selfie that
was taken outdoors almost directly from the front? It might have a
screen in the middle if it's taken with the front camera of a phone, but
not to the side:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-6.jpg width=200>
</div>
<p>In the avatar of SoniaMarima the eyes are also placed almost exactly
in the middle of the photo horizontally. And the color of the face looks
faded out similar to the photo of tom_zeh, or like the darkest tones
would've been made lighter with the levels feature in Photoshop, which
is a common feature of images generated with
thispersondoesnotexist.com:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-7.jpg width=200>
</div>
<p>The eyes in the three images are at nearly the same location:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-10.jpg width=200>
</div>
<p>The first tweet by prof_freedom was posted in April 2020 but the
first tweet by MrsMertes was posted in February 2021, and corona_realism
posted its first tweet in 2010.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aprof_freedom+until%3A2020-5-5&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aprof_freedom+until%3A2020-5-5&amp;f=live</a>,

So the accounts don't seem to have started posting at the same time.</p>
<p>holmenkollin/corona_realism already posted about conspiracy topics
before COVID, and it was known as <span class="quote">"Berkeley
Institute of Truth"</span> in 2019.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20190824083238/https://twitter.com/holmenkollin>http://web.archive.org/web/20190824083238/https://twitter.com/holmenkollin</a>]</p>
<p>On SoniaMarima's list of followers, the first two accounts from the
top are MrsMertes and corona_realism (but I don't know how the followers
are sorted though):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-freedom-8.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Another account which prof_freedom thanked is
<a href=https://x.com/theotherphilipp>theotherphilipp</a>, which is no
longer active, but its recent tweets included many retweets of
prof_freedom, MrsMertes, and corona_realism.</p>
<p>The German accounts mostly reposted other German accounts, so they
don't have many reposts of English-language accounts like illuminatibot
and Concerned Citizen that are often reposted by bots. The German
accounts still seem to repost a very similar set of accounts, but that
doesn't necessarily mean that they're bots, because they could just be
ran by a single person manually:</p>

</h2>
<p>Often accounts that promote Miles Guo post tweets in the replies of
popular accounts that aren't even related to the topic of the tweet. An
account that promotes Miles Guo called
<a href=https://x.com/riss1130>riss1130</a> posted this video of Miles

<div>

<p>The 4 newest non-reply tweets by the account consisted of two
retweets of VOAChinese, and two retweets of its own replies to
VOAChinese:</p>

recent reposts through the browser with AppleScript</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2023 Elon discontinued the free Twitter API. Now even with the
basic plan that costs 100 USD per month, the new API supports retrieving
only 10,000 tweets per month. And it supports only doing up to 5
timeline requests per 15 minutes, and the maximum number of tweets in a
single request is 100. So it's not very useful for identifying networks
of accounts based on reposts, because you can only retrieve 500 timeline
tweets in 15 minutes, and you can only do 100 requests of 100 tweets per
month.</p>
<p>Therefore I'm using AppleScript to scrape recent reposts through the
browser instead. The <code>trt</code> function gets retweets and the
<code>tqt</code> function gets quote tweets:</p>
<pre># sjs()(osascript -e&#39;on run{a}&#39; -e&#39;tell app&quot;safari&quot;to do javascript a in document 1&#39; -eend &quot;$1&quot;)

<p>When I used the code to scroll through the timeline of Alex Jones, it
reached the maximum limit of tweets that were shown after approximately
26 days worth of tweets. But during that time these were the accounts
that Alex Jones had reposted 4 or more times (where I added an asterisk
after the names of the usual suspects I have mentioned on this page
because they seem to be disproportionately reposted by bots):</p>

<p>Out of the accounts on the list above, for example Elon Musk, Tucker
Carlson, and David Icke are often also reposted by bots, but they are
such well-known people that they don't stand out as much as people like
Liz Churchill, who few people would probably know about if she wasn't
being artificially amplified on Twitter.</p>
<p>Next I looked at retweets by the Chinese bot
<a href=https://x.com/Ellenng2013>Ellenng2013</a>, because a large
percentage of its tweets are retweets of the usual suspects I have
mentioned on this page. It had retweeted these accounts at least 4 times
up to the point when Twitter stopped loading new tweets:</p>

<p>Jack Straw posted this video of tanks being transported on train:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The same video with variations of the same text had been posted by at
least 13 other accounts. Only a few accounts had posted the same
identical text as another account but the tweets generally had some kind
of small variations. But if the accounts were organically copying each
other, you wouldn't expect them to systematically introduce slight
variations to the text using a similar formula:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22According+to+unconfirmed+reports%2C+a+major+NATO%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22According+to+unconfirmed+reports%2C+a+major+NATO%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p><a href=https://x.com/yuu_amenomori>yuu_amenomori</a> is a Japanese

</h2>
<p>I noticed an account called
<a href=https://x.com/Loupgris1L31809>Loupgris1L31809</a> in the replies
of a tweet by Steve Kirsch, because it quoted a random tweet that had
nothing to do with the topic of Kirsch's tweet:

<div>
<img src=i/bot-kirschfrench-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I looked up the latest tweets by the French account, most of
them were retweets or quote tweets, or they were replies similar to the
reply to Kirsch which quoted a tweet by another user without any text.
When I counted how many times the account had reposted different
accounts up to the point when no more tweets were loaded by infinite
scrolling, many of the accounts were French, but the non-French accounts
included a large number of the usual suspects that are reposted by bots.
This shows all accounts with 5 or more reposts:</p>

<p>The plot below compares the number of retweets by Loupgris1L31809 to
the average number of retweets of other accounts I suspect to be bots.
Here the accounts in the yellow cluster at the bottom are mostly French
accounts that were reposted by Loupgris1L31809 but not by other accounts
I suspect to be bots:</p>

<p>The oldest tweet by Loupgris1L31809 is a link to a blog post by Karen
Kingston, and the second-oldest tweet is a link to a video by Astrid
Stuckelberger. Both of them have said that COVID vaccines contain
hydras:

<a href=#Maitreya_Rael id=Maitreya_Rael>Maitreya Rael</a>
</h2>
<p>The emblem of Raelianism combines a swastika and a Star of David,
which are both also featured in the emblem of Theosophy and in Helena
Blavatsky's personal seal. So it's no suprise that Rael is addressed
using the Theosophical title of <span
class="quote">"Maitreya"</span>.</p>
<p>For the past couple of months, the account of Maitreya Rael has
followed an unusual pattern, where sometimes for a couple of weeks it
only posts links to articles by Russia Today, but then during a single
day it posts a large number of retweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-first.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>However earlier the account regularly posted more retweets. It has
retweeted illuminatibot, Concerned Citizen, Mario Nawfal, Epoch Times,
Stew Peters, Anastasia Maria Loupis, Peter Sweden, Wide Awake Media, and
Robin Monotti. It also retweeted videos of kalamari clots that were
posted by thehealthb0t and Died Suddenly. It posted only a few retweets
of Raelian accounts, but they included Japanese-language tweets by
Raelian bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-retweet.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Maitreya Rael seems to often tweet about Assange similar to many of
the bots which promote Raelianism. Assange has been named as one of the
<span class="quote">"honorary guides"</span> of the Raelian Movement
along with people like Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. [<a href=https://raelianews.org/honorary-guides>https://raelianews.org/honorary-guides</a>]
The Raelian Movement has so far named a total of 103 <span
class="quote">"honorary guides"</span>, but many of the most recent
honorary guides are anti-vaccine activists.</p>
<p>When I scrolled through one year of Rael's tweets, almost all of them
were either retweets or links. The links usually went to RT, other news
sites, YouTube or TikTok videos, Facebook posts, or Raelian websites. I
didn't find a single tweet where Rael replied to another user. Up to
September 2023, I didn't find a single tweet that wasn't either a
retweet or a link to some external content, but in September 2023 and
earlier he seems to have sometimes posted random images with no
text.</p>
<p>I had to scroll almost a year before I found the first tweet that
contained text and that didn't link to an external website:
[<a href=https://x.com/maitreyarael/status/1688367493365313536>https://x.com/maitreyarael/status/1688367493365313536</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-onemin.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I bet if Jesus was alive today and he had a Twitter account, it would
also be a bot that would just retweet illuminatibot and post links to RT
articles.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Raelian_author_William_Borowczak id=Raelian_author_William_Borowczak>Raelian
author William Borowczak</a>
</h2>
<p>William Borowczak is an author who has written many books about
Raelianism. He has only about 300 followers but he is often reposted by
other Raelian accounts. However his Twitter account seems to follow a
similar pattern as Rael's account, because almost all of its tweets are
either retweets, links to random news articles, or links to Raelian
websites. [<a href=https://x.com/willambor>https://x.com/willambor</a>]
Both Rael and Borowczak also frequently retweet Anastasia Maria Loupis.
Borowczak retweeted French accounts which quote tweeted David Wolfe,
Wide Awake Media, Concerned Citizen, aussie17, and James O'Keefe. But
like Maitreya Rael, he only retweets other Raelian accounts rarely. He
reposted the same video of Andrew Bridgen that was posted by accounts
like Wide Awake Media and Concerned Citizen. He also posted multiple
tweets about Füllmich, including a link to a French article which said
that Füllmich was a political prisoner:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-boro.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>This was a rare tweet by William Borowczak which included text and
which didn't link to another website. But similar tweets had also been
posted by other accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-swastika.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The tweet below was the next tweet I found which included text and
which didn't link to another website, but variations of the same text
had been posted before by many other accounts.
<a href=https://x.com/le_beau_marco><a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22dont+parlent+les+journalistes%2C+c%27est+ce+que+jusqu%27%C3%A0%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22dont+parlent+les+journalistes%2C+c%27est+ce+que+jusqu%27%C3%A0%22&amp;f=live</a>]
The text says in French: <span class="quote">"The famous <span
class="quote">'cold wave'</span> that journalists are talking about, is
that what until recently we called <span
class="quote">'winter'</span>?"</span> An account called
[le_beau_marco</a> posted the same text twice within the same day, but
it tweets in a mixture of French, English, and Chinese, which is
reminiscent of the Raelian bots.</p>

Monotti, thehealthb0t, illuminatibot, David Cartland, DiedSuddenly, Wide
Awake Media, Jim Ferguson, Liz Churchill, redpillb0t, bambkb, William
Makis, Wall Street Apes, and Stew Peters. It also retweeted a tweet by
DR. KEK where Peter McCullough promoted TWC's spike detoxification
supplements. It retweeted a tweet by Liz Churchill which said that 20%
of vaccinated people in New Zealand had died according to Barry Young's
data. And it retweeted Vigilant Fox saying that Zelenko was a divinely

<a href=#Raelian_Elon_Musk_fan_bot_elias466 id=Raelian_Elon_Musk_fan_bot_elias466>Raelian
Elon Musk fan bot elias466</a>
</h2>
<p>The location of <a href=https://x.com/elias466>elias466</a> (Milady
De Lavoye) is set as Canada. Its own tweets are mostly written in
English or French but it often retweets Japanese Raelian accounts.</p>
<p>About one third of its newest non-reply tweets were retweets of
accounts related to Elon Musk. Most of its newest reply tweets were all
replies to Elon Musk fan accounts, and their length was typically around
1 to 5 characters (so they're reminiscent of Elon Musk's single-word
replies):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-raelelon-1.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>It also posted replies to fake Keanu Reeves accounts called
<a href=https://x.com/KeanuReeve12261>KeanuReeve12261</a> and
<a href=https://x.com/KeanuJ57>KeanuJ57</a>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-raelelon-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The account had also retweeted or quote tweeted Keanu Reeves fan bots
called <a href=https://x.com/MrKeanuRee44337>MrKeanuRee44337</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/KeanuReeve16414>KeanuReeve16414</a>,

<a href=https://x.com/EverythingKeanu>EverythingKeanu</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/keanureeves6k>keanureeves6k</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/Kean_ureevess>Kean_ureevess</a>, and
<a href=https://x.com/reeve14137>reeve14137</a>. It's interesting that
the username of many of the Keanu Reeves accounts features the word
<span class="quote">"reeve"</span> in the same way that the username or
display name of many Elon Musk fan bots includes Elon's middle name
Reeve.</p>
<p>elias466 started tweeting in 2013, but until 2015 most of its tweets
were links to Facebook posts:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelias466+until%3A2015-1-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aelias466+until%3A2015-1-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-raelelon-3.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>In 2016 elias466 also started posting links to news articles and
YouTube videos, random images, and replies to other users. But anyway
it's interesting that this bot has been in operation for over 10 years,
but it was later repurposed to promote Elon Musk in addition to
Raelianism. Earlier I found the bot Jakub8632 which primarily seems to
promote Falun Gong which is another UFO cult like Raelianism, but the
same bot sometimes also posts tweets using a similar formula as Elon
Musk fan bots and it often interacts with Elon Musk fan bots.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Raelian_Chief_Rabbi_Leon_Ariel_Mellul id=Raelian_Chief_Rabbi_Leon_Ariel_Mellul>Raelian
Chief Rabbi Leon Ariel Mellul</a>
</h2>
<p>The number two guy in Raelianism is their Chief Rabbi Leon Ariel
Mellul, who is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco. Compared to Rael, his
account has posted a lot more original tweets that aren't retweets or
links to random news articles, and his account has only 451 tweets, so
it seems more like a real account than most Raelian accounts.</p>
<p>However Leon Ariel Mellul has still retweeted many of my usual
suspects, like illuminatibot, Anastasia Maria Loupis, David Cartland,
Jim Ferguson, Vigilant Fox, Jackson Hinkle, Wide Awake Media, Truth
Justice, Craig Kelly, and DiedSuddenly. So I don't know if some of these
accounts are simply reposting tweets from the <span class="quote">"For
you"</span> feed, and Twitter is just showing tweets from my usual
suspects in the <span class="quote">"For you"</span> feed. But it's
still weird how for example Anastasia Maria Loupis has been reposted by
almost all Raelian accounts whose reposts I have checked:</p>

</h2>
<p>The accounts in this heatmap are not necessarily representative of
Raelian accounts as a whole, because I excluded accounts which had less
than 20 total reposts of the accounts shown in the heatmap, and I
decided which accounts I checked partially by picking accounts that had
often reposted the usual suspects I have covered on this page.</p>
<p>I still don't have access to Twitter's API, so I had to count the
reposts by scraping Twitter's web UI using an inconvenient
time-consuming method. So I haven't yet checked the reposts of these
Raelian accounts: <a href=https://1min4peace>1min4peace</a>,

<p>Some of the accounts shown above seemed like real people, and two
accounts didn't have enough tweets that I could count their reposts up
to the point when the infinite scrolling stops loading new tweets. But
the account that seemed the most like bots were NeilMcK19037102 and
mamaisdone. Both of them posted dozens of retweets per day. But
mamaisdone had posted only 25 non-retweet tweets in the past 3 years.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Amamaisdone&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Amamaisdone&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>The bio of mamaisdone still says <span class="quote">"Mother of two
locked up kids for no reason"</span>, even though lockdowns haven't been
in place for a long time:</p>
<div>

<p>NeilMcK19037102 has over 30,000 tweets even though its account is
only about a year old:</p>

<p>When I counted the reposts of the three accounts mentioned above to
the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets, all
three accounts had reposted Concerned Citizen and Wide Awake Media at
least 20 times:</p>

</h2>
<p>One of the accounts that is most frequently reposted by Alex Jones is
newstart_2021, whose avatar is a photo of Albert Camus. A large
percentage of its tweets used to be links to content by Alex Jones.</p>
<p>In May 2024 Camus posted a tweet about a <span
class="quote">"disturbing new study"</span> but he didn't link to the
study or even mention who the authors were. However he quoted a part of
the abstract, and when I googled for the abstract, I found that the
so-called new study was a paper by Norman Fenton et al. that was
published in September 2021:
[<a href=https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1795494623902617964>https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1795494623902617964</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-oldnew.jpg width=500>

<p>The same day Jim Ferguson posted the video below from a Canadian Zoom
meeting.
[<a href=https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1795374597883269339>https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1795374597883269339</a>]
He said the video was breaking news, even though actually the video had
been posted on YouTube 20 days earlier by Christine Massey, who recorded
the video because she was was accidentally sent an invite to the meeting
which was supposed to be sent to another person who had the same name as
her.
[<a href=https://christinemasseyfois.substack.com/p/leaked-video-canadian-public-health>https://christinemasseyfois.substack.com/p/leaked-video-canadian-public-health</a>]
However Ferguson didn't credit Massey or link to the source of the
video, but he added a screen to the end of the video where he promoted
his own organization which made it seem like he was the original source
of the video:</p>

to Vigilant News article about Peter McCullough that was posted by
Maitreya Rael</a>
</h2>
<p>Maitreya Rael posted this link to an article about Peter McCullough
at Vigilant News, which unusually said <span class="quote">"check

words <span class="quote">"content"</span> and <span
class="quote">"Dr."</span> were joined together:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-maitreya-checkup-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I searched for tweets that matched the text
<code>"Check up this awesome contentDr."</code>, I found bots that had
posted links to several other articles about McCullough at Vigilant
News:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22check+up+this+awesome+contentdr.%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22check+up+this+awesome+contentdr.%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>This Japanese bot posted a similar tweet but it translated the title
of the news story to Japanese:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-maitreya-checkup-4.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The same Japanese bot had recently reposted Concerned Citizen,
Vigilant Fox, DiedSuddenly, Jim Ferguson, Vigilant News, Wall Street
Silver, Wall Street Apes, nikola 3, and Liz Churchill:

<p>Up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more
tweets, the Japanese bot had retweeted or quote tweeted the accounts
below at least 6 times. Almost all of them are Japanese, with the
exception of Jim Ferguson, Vigilant Fox, Vigilant News, two other
English-language accounts, and two Chinese-language accounts:</p>

<p>The links to Vigilant News articles which said <span

August and December 2023, but before it similar tweets were mostly
posted by Indian accounts:</p>
<div>

<p>One of the tweets which told people to check up content by Vigilant

<p>I searched for <code>lang:ko (vladimir OR zev) zelenko</code>, the
search results included tweets by a total of 7 accounts, but one of them
was the bot Raelian Amor which promotes Raelianism in Korean:

<p>A third account which posted about Zelenko in Korean was a Qtard

McCullough and Füllmich. These screenshots of the account are

<p>When I searched for the text of another tweet by CMDRVALTHOR in

the display name <span class="quote">"Elon Musk ( Parody )"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-keasea-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The most recent tweets by the account called <span

Elon Musk, but instead its 20 newest non-reply tweets included 2 reposts
of CMDRVALTHOR and Jack Straw, one repost of DR. Kek, and one repost of
nikola 3:</p>

</h2>
<p>MAVERICK X
(<a href=https://x.com/MAVERIC68078049>MAVERIC68078049</a>) is an
account with about 100,000 followers that primarily tweets about
transgender celebrities and Tartaria. It also tweets about flat earth
like most accounts that tweet about Tartaria, including nikola 3 and
Jack Straw. nikola 3 has sometimes randomly tweeted in Chinese,
Japanese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German. And Jack Straw has
also posted tweets in French, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, and
Dutch.

However MAVERIC68078049 has also tweeted in Turkish, Italian, German,
Arabic, and Hebrew:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-maverick-1.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The Hebrew tweet shown above was a passage from the Old Testament,
which was a piece of text that a real person might have manually copied
from somewhere, and the Turkish tweet said <span class="quote">"you're
welcome"</span> which is a common phrase that even people who don't
speak Turkish might know. However there were 5 tweets returned when I
searched for <code>from:MAVERIC68078049 lang:ar</code>, but three of them
seemed like automated tweets, because they were similar photos of cars
that featured a heart emoji and Arabic text which said <span
class="quote">"thanks God"</span>, <span class="quote">"God's
blessings"</span>, and <span class="quote">"blessed feast"</span>. The
remaining two Arabic tweets were a reply to another user that said <span
class="quote">"God knows"</span>, and a verse from the Quran:

</div>
<p>When I searched for the text of tweets by MAVERICK X in double
quotes, usually I found that similar or identical tweets had earlier
been posted by other accounts. Tweets like this tweet had been posted by
five other accounts, but one of them was
<a href=https://x.com/vegastarr>vegastarr</a> which also promotes
Tartaria and flat earth like MAVERICK X:</p>

<p>The text of the next tweet I searched had only been posted before by

<div>
<img src=i/bot-maverick-4.jpg width=500>

<p>The five newest tweets by tallanor1000 were retweets of Jessica
Rojas, Peter Sweden, Wide Awake Media, Concerned Citizen, and Simon

<p>In the tree below I calculated a distance matrix between accounts

included a total of 83 accounts whose reposts I had scraped up to the

also includes reposts of many real people who are not bots. However the
tree is not very accurate because it's not based on a large enough

<p>When I searched for <code>lang:vi peter mccullough</code>, the newest
tweet was posted by a bot called
<a href=https://x.com/SmolfSmolf7>SmolfSmolf7</a>. Its location was set
as Texas and it tweeted in a mixture of Vietnamese and English. Often
other bots that post about western conspiracy topics in Asian languages
are portrayed as Asians who live in the west or westerners who live in
Asia.</p>
<p>Many of the latest tweets by the bot were about flat earth, or about
Qtard concepts like medbeds and the quantum financial system (some of
these tweets were machine translated from Vietnamese):</p>

<p>In one of the tweets above Jesus was called Sananda. Wikipedia says:
<span class="quote">"The so called Ascended Master Teachings teacher
Joshua David Stone (whose organization, the I AM University, was
originally headquartered near San Luis Obispo, California), began
holding his Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings in 1996. Stone had begun
teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that
the Master Jesus, under his galactic name <span
class="quote">'Sananda'</span> (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after
his resurrection), works with Commander Ashtar, flying with Pallas
Athena in their own flying saucer within the Ashtar Galactic Command
flying saucer fleet as its Commander-in-Chief.[37]"</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Jesus>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Jesus</a>]
When I searched for old books with references to Yuri Bezmenov, I found
a book published by the Tehuchapi Phoenix UFO cult which also taught
that Jesus Sananda lived on a spaceship together with a Pleiadian
Ascended Master called Commander Gyeorgos Ceres Hatonn.

<p>The Vietnamese bot had recently replied to an account that pretended
to be JFK Jr. The account had only 45 tweets, but one of them was a
video where Maria Zeee interviewed Robert Young about graphene oxide,
and another was a video of Steve Kirsch with VigilantFox's
watermark:</p>

<p>When I searched for <code>lang:vi karen kingston</code>, there was
only one result, but it was posted by an account called
<a href=https://x.com/QFs_Global>QFs_Global</a>. The account had the
hashtags #nesara and #gesara in its bio, and it promoted flat earth and

<p>Another account which posted about Peter McCullough in Vietnamese was
called <a href=https://x.com/LeVansy02871550>LeVansy02871550</a>. Its
pinned tweet was an AI-generated image of Elon Musk and its bio said in
Vietnamese <span class="quote">"GO TO MARS WITH ELON MUSK. LOVE

Elon Musk fan accounts like ElonMuskAOC (which used to have an icon of
Wall Street Silver next to its name). It also posted about NESARA and
GESARA:</p>

post that much about Western conspiracy topics, but one time it still
randomly reposted a photo of kalamari clots. Its homepage was an
affiliate link to a page about a cryptocurrency Pi, which was also the
main topic it posted about. However it often also promoted Elon Musk and
Trump:</p>

<p>In this plot I selected accounts that often posted about COVID and
that had at least 10,000 followers, and that were either accounts that
had been reposted many times by accounts I suspected to be bots,
accounts I followed myself, or other accounts that I happened to think
of. So it's not a complete collection of users who post about COVID, and
it's biased towards the kind of accounts that are often reposted by
bots:</p>

<span class="quote">"repost"</span> as a term for includes both retweets
and quote tweets, even though I guess in X lingo a <span

call retweets. I used AppleScript to scrape the retweets and quote
tweets of accounts I suspected to be bots up to the point when the
infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets.</p>

<p>On the list above TheSeeker268 doesn't actually seem to be reposted
by bots that often, but his tweets were just reposted by one account 34
times. So maybe I could've used some method to eliminate outliers like
his account.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#sophiadahl1_and_mariusknulst id=sophiadahl1_and_mariusknulst>sophiadahl1
and mariusknulst</a>
</h2>
<p>In the previous section where I took the number of retweets by
accounts I suspected to be bots and I divided it by the number of
followers for each account with more than 10,000 followers, the account
that ranked first was
<a href=https://x.com/mariusknulst>mariusknulst</a>, and the account
that ranked third was <a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1>sophiadahl1</a>.
They are both portrayed as accounts of the same Norwegian lady, but I'm
not sure if she's a real person. The mariusknulst account was created in
2014 but it had only a few tweets until March 2020, even though since
March 2020 the two accounts have posted more than 300,000 tweets
combined. The mariusknulst account seems to have been suspended from
June 2021 until February 2023.</p>
<p>Here sophiadahl1 retweeted accounts that quoted one of her tweets and
translated it to Turkish, Arabic, and Finnish. The Finnish account is
likely a bot because its tweet was machine translated in broken Finnish
(and it has posted many other similar tweets where it has quoted a tweet
and machine translated it in broken Finnish, and it was also one of the
few accounts I found which had posted about Miles Guo in Finnish):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-1.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The English text which was translated to Finnish said: <span
class="quote">"I took care of those children who came in with
myocarditis after the vax."</span> But the Finnish translation was
missing the word <span class="quote">"vax"</span> so it didn't make
sense, because it means something like <span class="quote">"I treated
the children who received a heart muscle after the injury."</span> I
guess it's because the word <span class="quote">"vax"</span> was not
translated by the machine translator, because Google Translate produced
an identical translation where it skipped the word <span
class="quote">"vax"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-6.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>sophiadahl1 posted this video about flat earth, but the same video
with the identical text had been posted earlier by another account (and
tweets with some variations in the text had been posted by at least 5
other accounts):
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22The+Flat+Earth+map+is+used+by+all+airplane+auto-pilot+navigation%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22The+Flat+Earth+map+is+used+by+all+airplane+auto-pilot+navigation%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>sophiadahl1 has also retweeted many tweets about flat earth:</p>

<p>Added later: Later when I checked the most recent tweets by
SophiaDahl1 again, within the 10 hours it had retweeted a tweet about
flat earth, it had retweeted tweets in Turkish, German, Hindi, and
Chinese, and it had retweeted accounts which quoted one of its tweets
and commented on the tweet in Turkish, Bosnian, Finnish, Swedish, and
Dutch, and it had retweeted an AI-generated image of Elon Musk that was
posted by an Elon Musk fan account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-7.jpg width=1400>
</div>
<p>sophiadahl1 posted two variations of the tweet below about one month
apart. In the older version of the tweet there was one error that was
corrected in the newer version, but in the newer version there were
three errors introduced that were missing from the older version. But if
the newer tweet was manually edited by a human based on the older tweet,
then why were there multiple new errors introduced in the newer tweet
that did not exist in the older tweet? The tweets look like they might
be generated by AI based on some template so that it introduced random
emojis and a certain number of errors to the template, so that the tweet
doesn't look like grammatically perfect text that was generated by AI
but it looks like text that was written by a crazy person:
[<a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1808009492262510961>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1808009492262510961</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1822181811012722858>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1822181811012722858</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-8.png width=1000>
</div>
<p>Emojis for red question marks and red exclamation marks are
frequently also used by Thekeksociety whose tweets seem
AI-generated.</p>
<p>Added in January 2025: An account called XPHOENIXDRAGON which is
similar to Thekeksociety posted the tweet below, where it added a red
question mark emoji to the end of the first line even though a question
mark didn't make sense as punctuation at that point (in the same way
that sophiadahl1 used an interrobang emoji as punctuation at a spot
where it didn't make sense):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-10.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Variations of the same tweet with different punctuation characters
had been posted by many other accounts since 2021 (so it seems like the
question mark emoji might have been introduced by some AI program which
introduced a certain number of changes to the text of the some earlier
tweet):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-11.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>XPHOENIXDRAGON also promotes flat earth like sophiadahl1 and
Thekeksociety:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-12.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Added in February 2025: When I scrolled through sophiadahl1's tweets
from the past 24 hours, it had again retweeted a bunch of random Turkish
tweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-turk.png width=1000>
</div>
<p>But when I searched for <code>from:sophiadahl1 lang:tr</code> and
<code>from:mariusknulst lang:tr</code>, and I didn't find any original
Turkish-language tweets by either account. And I also didn't find either
account mentioning that they speak Turkish anywhere.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#More_Asian_accounts_with_many_reposts_about_COVID id=More_Asian_accounts_with_many_reposts_about_COVID>More
Asian accounts with many reposts about COVID</a>
</h2>
<p>When I used search phrases like <code>lang:ko karen kingston</code>,
<code>lang:zh latypova</code>, <code>lang:ja peter mccullough</code>, and
<code>lang:th mike yeadon</code>, I found a few new accounts that seemed
like bots and that had many recent tweets about COVID. I'm not sure if
all of the accounts are bots, but here's a heatmap of the accounts that
were reposted most often by the East Asian and Southeast Asian
accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-asian-heat.png width=450>
</div>
<p>I only included accounts that were reposted by at least 5 users, so
that for example I was able to exclude Korean accounts that weren't
reposted by non-Korean accounts.</p>
<p>A huge number of reposts by a Chinese account called
<a href=https://x.com/FIQwkiqTlIeVRDm>心是莲花20201016</a> were reposts
of accounts related to The Wellness Company, like Peter McCullough,
Vigilant Fox, McCullough Foundation, and William Makis. William Makis
used to be listed as a member of the chief medical board of the Canadian
branch of TWC, but it now seems to be defunct because their website gets
redirected to the main website of TWC.
