<a href=#Pentagons_anti_vaccine_psyop_campaign_on_Twitter id=Pentagons_anti_vaccine_psyop_campaign_on_Twitter>Pentagon's anti-vaccine psyop campaign on Twitter</a>
</h2>
<p>In June 2024 Reuters published a report about an anti-vaccine campaign on social media that initially targeted the Philippines but that later also extended to Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries. According to Reuters the campaign was focused on criticizing Sinovac vaccines and Chinese products like face masks and testing kits, and it ran from 2020 until 2021. The Reuters article said that the program was ran out of MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa: [<a href=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/>https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To implement the anti-vax campaign, the Defense Department overrode strong objections from top U.S. diplomats in Southeast Asia at the time, Reuters found. Sources involved in its planning and execution say the Pentagon, which ran the program through the military's psychological operations center in Tampa, Florida, disregarded the collateral impact that such propaganda may have on innocent Filipinos.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>A senior U.S. military commander responsible for Southeast Asia, Special Operations Command Pacific General Jonathan Braga, pressed his bosses in Washington to fight back in the so-called information space, according to three former Pentagon officials.</p>
<p>The commander initially wanted to punch back at Beijing in Southeast Asia. The goal: to ensure the region understood the origin of COVID while promoting skepticism toward what were then still-untested vaccines offered by a country that they said had lied continually since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In spring 2020, special-ops commander Braga turned to a cadre of psychological-warfare soldiers and contractors in Tampa to counter Beijing's COVID efforts. Colleagues say Braga was a longtime advocate of increasing the use of propaganda operations in global competition. In trailers and squat buildings at a facility on Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base, U.S. military personnel and contractors would use anonymous accounts on X, Facebook and other social media to spread what became an anti-vax message. The facility remains the Pentagon's clandestine propaganda factory.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The Pentagon's audit concluded that the military's primary contractor handling the campaign, General Dynamics IT, had employed sloppy tradecraft, taking inadequate steps to hide the origin of the fake accounts, said a person with direct knowledge of the review. The review also found that military leaders didn't maintain enough control over its psyop contractors, the person said.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>And in February, the contractor that worked on the anti-vax campaign - General Dynamics IT - won a $493 million contract. Its mission: to continue providing clandestine influence services for the military.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The undercover nurse Erin Marie Olszewski wrote that before she launched an anti-vaccine organization in 2019, she worked <span class="quote">"in the antiterrorism units at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Most of what happened there is stuff that I can't talk about. Even the fact that there is an antiterrorism unit there isn't known by many people."</span> [<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT91>https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91</a>] The headquarters of the U.S. Special Operations Command are located at MacDill. Alex Jones has also said that some of his staff members have worked at MacDill or for Special Operations Command. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523163150/https://alexjonesexposed.info/>https://web.archive.org/web/20180523163150/https://alexjonesexposed.info/</a>] In a talk in 2022, the undercover nurse Olszewski also said that she was <span class="quote">"trained at the John F. Kennedy special warfare center in Fort Bragg in psychological operations and civil affairs"</span>. [<a href=https://gregwyatt.net/did-erin-malone-olszewski-work-undercover-at-hospitals-schools-and-orphanages-in-iraq/>https://gregwyatt.net/did-erin-malone-olszewski-work-undercover-at-hospitals-schools-and-orphanages-in-iraq/</a>]</p>
<p>When I googled for <code>"general dynamics it" psyops before:2024-6-1</code>, I found that General Dynamics IT had posted job listings with titles like <span class="quote">"Counter Intelligence Role Players"</span>, <span class="quote">"Surveillance Role Player"</span>, and <span class="quote">"Surveillance Team Role Player"</span>. [<a href=https://gangstalkingmindcontrolcults.com/more-job-ads-for-surveillance-role-players-counter-intelligence-role-players-etc/>https://gangstalkingmindcontrolcults.com/more-job-ads-for-surveillance-role-players-counter-intelligence-role-players-etc/</a>] I found another job listing for a surveillance role player by GDIT: <a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-survelliance-herndon-virginia-203058.><a href="https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-survelliance-herndon-virginia-203058" class="uri">https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-survelliance-herndon-virginia-203058</a>.</a></p>
<p>But in any case, the Reuters article seems like a kind of a limited hangout that downplayed the scope of the anti-vaccine campaign on social media, because it made it seem like the purpose of the campaign was to promote American vaccine brands over a Chinese brand, and that the campaign only targeted third world countries, and that the campaign was already over. But in reality it seems like there is a much broader anti-vaccine campaign on social media which is targeted against vaccines as a whole and not just Chinese vaccines, and the campaign is also targeted against a western audience, and it's still ongoing. Or there are probably several arms of the campaign, but maybe the arm that was targeted against the Philippines seemed innocuous enough that Reuters was allowed to write about it.</p>
<p>Added later: In August 2020 General Dynamics IT got a 9.45 million USD contract from CDC to manage VAERS over the next year, but by 2022 GDIT had received over 35 million USD to manage VAERS. Josh Guetzkow published a series of reports from GDIT to CDC received through FOIA. [<a href=https://researchrebel.substack.com/p/the-banality-of-vaers>https://researchrebel.substack.com/p/the-banality-of-vaers</a>] Apparently GDIT was even responsible for managing low-level tasks at VAERS like filling in case information, because a report by GDIT said that they had insufficient resources to perform requirements like <span class="quote">"data processing, telephone inquiries, clinical inquiries, etc."</span>, and a later report said that they had hired over 200 additional staff to process reports. I also found a job listing posted by GDIT for a Spanish-speaking person to request missing information about VAERS reports over a phone. [<a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/bilingual-health-information-customer-service-specialist-remote-opportunity-not-applicable-texas-933644>https://clearedjobs.net/job/bilingual-health-information-customer-service-specialist-remote-opportunity-not-applicable-texas-933644</a>]</p>
<p>I also found job listings by GDIT with titles like <span class="quote">"Role Player - Surveillance"</span>, <span class="quote">"Counterintelligence Role Player"</span>, and <span class="quote">"Role Player CI"</span> (counterintelligence). [<a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-survelliance-herndon-virginia-203058>https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-survelliance-herndon-virginia-203058</a>, <a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/counter-intelligence-role-players-part-time-1099-contractor-herndon-virginia-643194>https://clearedjobs.net/job/counter-intelligence-role-players-part-time-1099-contractor-herndon-virginia-643194</a>, <a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-ci-herndon-virginia-203063>https://clearedjobs.net/job/role-player-ci-herndon-virginia-203063</a>] All of them are in the DC area though and not Tampa.</p>
<p>GDIT also posted a job listing with the title <span class="quote">"Resistance Training Lab Role-Play Instructor"</span>, which said: <span class="quote">"Personnel shall possess the ability to apply various captor exploitation efforts, to include: interrogation (eight methods), indoctrination, propaganda, video propaganda, concessions, forced labor, and reprisals."</span> [<a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/resistance-training-lab-role-play-instructor-ft-rucker-alabama-727178>https://clearedjobs.net/job/resistance-training-lab-role-play-instructor-ft-rucker-alabama-727178</a>] It seems to be overtly presented as a job position for someone to pretends to be a torturer in order to train personnel to withstand torture, but I don't know if they're just using it as a not-so-clever cover to hire torturers. (Or I don't know if torturer is the right term, because the required skillset also seems to include brainwashing prisoners.)</p>
<p>An announcement from 2020 said: [<a href=https://clearedjobs.net/job/gdit-invitational-hiring-event-fort-bragg-fayetteville-nc-fayetteville-north-carolina-793665>https://clearedjobs.net/job/gdit-invitational-hiring-event-fort-bragg-fayetteville-nc-fayetteville-north-carolina-793665</a>]</p>

<p>It's interesting that GDIT has locations at both Fort Bragg where Erin said she was trained in psyops and in Tampa where she said she worked at an antiterrorism unit. Their office at Tampa is located about 5 km away from MacDill AFB. The military's supposed remote viewing program called Project Stargate was also ran out of Fort Bragg.</p>
<p>In her book Erin wrote <span class="quote">"I live right by Clearwater Beach"</span> but I don't know if she still lives there. [<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT117>https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117</a>] Clearwater Beach is where the world headquarters of the Church of Scientology are located, which is about 30 km away from MacDill.</p>
<p>In 2019, an anti-vax organization called Conscience Coalition was founded by Renee Bessone and her husband Greg Mitchell, who in 2015 was called the main lobbyist for the Church of Scientology in Washington. [<a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/church-of-scientology-washington-lobbyist-2015-4>https://www.businessinsider.com/church-of-scientology-washington-lobbyist-2015-4</a>] Bessone has reached OT level VIII which is the highest auditing level in Scientology. [<a href=https://www.truthaboutscientology.com/stats/by-name/r/renee-bessone.html>https://www.truthaboutscientology.com/stats/by-name/r/renee-bessone.html</a>] Mitchell's lobbying firm has also represented Soros's Open Society Policy Center, and the Mitchell Firm is listed as having received 80,000 USD from Open Society Policy Center in 2006, 80,000 USD in 2007, 55,000 USD in 2008, and 70,000 USD in 2013.

[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/>https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/</a>] The excecutive director of Conscience Coalition is Jonathan Lockwood, who said on Twitter that he is a Scientologist. [<a href=https://consciencecoalition.com/press/>https://consciencecoalition.com/press/</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/JNTHN_LCKWD/status/1576004158246699008>https://twitter.com/JNTHN_LCKWD/status/1576004158246699008</a>] There's a video where Erin and another lady said that they were representing Conscience Coalition.

<a href=#John_F_Kennedy_Jr_accounts id=John_F_Kennedy_Jr_accounts>John F. Kennedy Jr. accounts</a>
</h2>
<p>John F. Kennedy Jr. is JFK's son who is supposed to have died in a plane crash according to official history, but QAnon followers believe that he is still alive and he will one day emerge from hiding and become Trump's vice president. I found dozens of these accounts that pretend to be JFK Jr.: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22john+f.+kennedy+jr.%22&f=user>https://x.com/search?q=%22john+f.+kennedy+jr.%22&amp;f=user</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-jfk-1.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>When I searched for the text a tweet by one of the accounts in double quotes, the same text had been posted by 4 other JFK Jr. accounts, but it was also posted by an account that portrayed a fairly unknown Qtard YouTuber called Axel Vasa:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-jfk-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I think Axel Vasa's real account is called <a href=https://x.com/summmertc>summmertc</a>, but other accounts which portray him are called Summmertec, axeIvasa, summmertCe, SummmertC, WestWizard45, summmeritiC, axelvasa0001, ismeaxelvasa, axelvasa089, AxelVasa06, summmertCe, real_SummmmertC, V1362Axel, and SummmretC. They copy tweets by the real Axel Vasa so I found them by searching the text of his tweets in double quotes: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Take+That+Earthlings%2C+When+A+Pleiadean+Speaks.+I+Love+You%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Take+That+Earthlings%2C+When+A+Pleiadean+Speaks.+I+Love+You%22&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Two+Clones+Debating%2C%2C%2C%2C%2CCould+Be+Good%2C%2C%2C%2C%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Two+Clones+Debating%2C%2C%2C%2C%2CCould+Be+Good%2C%2C%2C%2C%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-jfk-3.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>I think the original JFK Jr. account was Real_JFK2024 which has now been suspended, so the other accounts could just be bots that copied the original account, in the same way that the different Axel Vasa accounts could be bots that are copying the real Axel Vasa.</p>
<p>Two of the JFK Jr. accounts posted this engagement farming question that had also been posted by several MAGA accounts and by a fake account that portrayed the Q guy Charlie Ward: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Do+you+believe+Barack+Obama+began+the+downfall+of+The+United+States%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Do+you+believe+Barack+Obama+began+the+downfall+of+The+United+States%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-jfk-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Another similar engagement farming question was posted two different JFK Jr. accounts, but it was also posted by multiple fairly popular MAGA accounts with over 10,000 followers. It seems to have been originally posted by an account called DonaldTNews: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Do+you+agree+with+Donald+Trump+saying+all+CCP%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Do+you+agree+with+Donald+Trump+saying+all+CCP%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-jfk-5.jpg width=1400>
</div>
<p>Almost all tweets by one of the JFK Jr. accounts were retweets of either Mike Lindell or Judy Mikovits. [<a href=https://x.com/ford_judit97989>https://x.com/ford_judit97989</a>] It might be a coincidence, but Mikovits's Twitter account used to be ran by the Qtard Zach Vorhies who also booked her interviews with Qtard YouTubers like RedPill78 and Tracy Beanz. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423204807/https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-amplify-pharma-whistleblower-judy-mikovits>http://web.archive.org/web/20200423204807/https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-amplify-pharma-whistleblower-judy-mikovits</a>] Vorhies claimed that the day when he came out as a whistleblower on Project Veritas, he received a text message from Q which said that he had guardian angels watching over him.

[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Adrnomask+mccullough&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Adrnomask+mccullough&amp;f=live</a>] Out of his four most recent Rumble videos, one was an advertisement for Foster Coulson's dating site Unjected and the other was an advertisement for the Z-STACK product which is sold by TWC: [<a href=https://rumble.com/user/DoctorRay>https://rumble.com/user/DoctorRay</a>]</p>

<p>In 2020 and 2021 the Chinese account that now promotes McCullough was constantly promoting Limeng Yan: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AFIQwkiqTlIeVRDm+until%3A2021-3-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3AFIQwkiqTlIeVRDm+until%3A2021-3-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>Limeng Yan's podcast is hosted by America Out Loud News, which also hosts the podcasts of 3 out of 5 people on TWC's chief medical board (who are Peter McCullough, Harvey Risch, and James Thorp).

</h2>
<p>I searched for <code>lang:ja limeng yan</code>, which is likely to return tweets by bots because real Japanese people would normally write Limeng Yan's name with Chinese characters. Two of the newest tweets were posted by this bot called glorious_harmo that promotes QAnon and that tweets in a mixture of Japanese, Arabic, and English: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=lang%3Aja+limeng+yan&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=lang%3Aja+limeng+yan&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/glorious_harmo>https://x.com/glorious_harmo</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-limeng-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The pinned tweet of the bot includes an image that says <span class="quote">"WHERE WE GO ONE, WE GO ALL"</span> and that has the hashtags <span class="quote">"#QAnon"</span> and <span class="quote">"#TheGreatAwakening"</span>. The same image is used by Arkmedic as his profile picture at Gab and his banner image at Twitter. Arkmedic is an old username of Jikkyleaks who used to be a QAnon follower (and I think he's from the UK but he lives in Australia, so it's weird that he would have an American flag in his banner image): [<a href=https://gab.com/arkmedic>https://gab.com/arkmedic</a>, <a href=https://x.com/arkmedic>https://x.com/arkmedic</a>]</p>

<p>The glorious_harmo account has also posted tweets in many other languages (even though all 6 tweets shown below were part of threads which consisted of the same tweet translated to multiple different languages): [<a href=https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1742152127798288793>https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1742152127798288793</a>, <a href=https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1741804560631664790>https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1741804560631664790</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>The oldest tweet by the account was a Japanese translation of an article about Barry Young by Natural News. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aglorious_harmo%20until%3A2023-12-17&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aglorious_harmo%20until%3A2023-12-17&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1735902717892231437>https://x.com/glorious_harmo/status/1735902717892231437</a>] A reply to the tweet also included an Arabic translation of the same article:</p>

<p>In August 2024 several MAGA accounts posted variations of the tweet shown below. The first account I found which posted a tweet with the formula was called <span class="quote">"Marjorie Taylor Greene Press Release (Parody)"</span>, and the second account was called <span class="quote">"Kimala Harrimuff"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-1.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>Most accounts which posted the tweet were pro-Trump accounts. But a similar tweet was also posted by a pro-Kamala account called kamala_wins47:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>kamala_wins47 has also posted other tweets that followed a similar formula as tweets by MAGA accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>kamala_wins47 ends many of its tweets with the phrase <span class="quote">"It sure would be a shame if everyone shared this and it went VIRAL!"</span> The same phrase has been used by the MAGA influencer <a href=https://x.com/BoLoudon>Bo Loudon</a> and by many MAGA accounts that have copied tweets from Bo Loudon: <a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22It+sure+would+be+a+shame+if+everyone+shared+this+and+it+went+VIRAL!%22&f=live.><a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22It+sure+would+be+a+shame+if+everyone+shared+this+and+it+went+VIRAL!%22&amp;f=live" class="uri">https://x.com/search?q=%22It+sure+would+be+a+shame+if+everyone+shared+this+and+it+went+VIRAL!%22&amp;f=live</a>.</a> At first I thought that kamala_wins47 might have been part of a botnet which also included pro-Trump accounts, and the phrase was part of some kind of a template that was used by multiple bots. But in each case I checked, the MAGA accounts which used the phrase had copied their tweets from Bo Loudon. Bo Loudon was also the earliest account I found which used the phrase. So it could be that kamala_wins47 simply copied the phrase manually from Bo Loudon:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-4.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>Many tweets by Bo Loudon also end with the phrase <span class="quote">"Kamala definitely wouldn't want you to share this!"</span> The same phrase was also used multiple times by a MAGA account called Carter Hughes which has over 200,000 followers: <a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Kamala+definitely+wouldn%27t+want+you+to+share+this%21%22&f=live.><a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22Kamala+definitely+wouldn%27t+want+you+to+share+this%21%22&amp;f=live" class="uri">https://x.com/search?q=%22Kamala+definitely+wouldn%27t+want+you+to+share+this%21%22&amp;f=live</a>.</a> Several other accounts had also used the same phrase, but in each case I checked their tweets were copied from either Bo Loudon or Carter Hughes. The tweets by Carter Hughes always started with the word <span class="quote">"BREAKING:"</span> but the tweets by Bo Loudon always started with an alert sign emoji. Sometimes a similar tweet was posted by both accounts, so at first I thought either of them might have always copied the tweets from the other one in case the other one always posted the tweets first, but there were some tweets which were only posted by Bo Loudon and other tweets that were only posted by Carter Hughes. However it doesn't necessarily mean that the tweets were automated, because it might for example be that Bo Loudon and Carter Hughes had the same social media manager:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-6.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>An account called <a href=https://x.com/x_graziana2>Jen_trump</a> copied a tweet from Bo Loudon and it also retweeted many tweets by Bo Loudon:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-8.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>Jen_trump posted a tweet which said <span class="quote">"Attention everyone! I'm a trump supporting independent woman but nobody see my posts"</span>, and it retweeted another account which posted a similar tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/x_graziana2>https://x.com/x_graziana2</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I also found 18 other Trump-supporting independent women whose posts were seen by nobody. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Attention+everyone%21+I%27m+a+trump+supporting+independent+woman+but%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Attention+everyone%21+I%27m+a+trump+supporting+independent+woman+but%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>Conspirador Norteño pointed out that kamala_wins47 posted many links to a shop that sells t-shirts, and it posted tweets which featured the phrases <span class="quote">"This video was deleted from Twitter"</span> and <span class="quote">"You know what to do"</span>, but another account which had earlier followed a similar formula was called Emywinst: [<a href=https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1825916257645858992>https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1825916257645858992</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-10.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>When I searched for a combination of the two phrases on Twitter, there were many other accounts which had also used the phrases, even though their tweets seem to have been generally copied from either Emywinst or kamala_wins47. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22this+video+was+deleted+from+twitter%22+%22you+know+what+to+do%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22this+video+was+deleted+from+twitter%22+%22you+know+what+to+do%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>kamala_wins47 posted a screenshot of the profile of Emywinst and said <span class="quote">"That's me"</span>, even though the tweet has now been deleted: [<a href=https://x.com/ushadrons/status/1826252203180581039/photo/2>https://x.com/ushadrons/status/1826252203180581039/photo/2</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gunther-12.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>An account called <a href=https://x.com/Kamala_tim_wins>Kamala_tim_wins</a> seems to operate with a similar formula as kamala_wins47, and it posts links to the same t-shirt store. Kamala_tim_wins used to be called wins_trump47 until August 6th 2024 UTC, but it has now deleted all of its tweets that were posted before it changed its name. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%40wins_trump47&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%40wins_trump47&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://memory.lol/app/tw/Kamala_tim_wins>https://memory.lol/app/tw/Kamala_tim_wins</a>] However after the account had already changed its name, it seems to have accidentally posted this anti-Kamala tweet that was copied from Joey Mannarino: [<a href=https://x.com/Kamala_tim_wins/status/1821364252696866878>https://x.com/Kamala_tim_wins/status/1821364252696866878</a>, <a href=https://archive.is/k5ERy>https://archive.is/k5ERy</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>In July 2024 Steve Kirsch had a subretinal hemorrhage so he went permanently blind in one eye (or at least he was still blind as of June 2025). Many of his followers were saying that he went blind because he got the COVID shots. But ironically he may have actually gone blind because he took Peter McCullough's supplements. He seems to have kept it mostly under the wraps, but I only heard him mention it in passing during one of his VSRF videos in August 2024. Maybe he hasn't mentioned it elsewhere if he doesn't want to throw McCullough under the bus.</p>
<p>But anyway in the VSRF video Kirsch said: <span class="quote">"This thing happened to me. And I'll let people know to be careful, to be careful about anything you put into your body. I don't care if it's a vaccine or a supplement or a drug. Make sure you really understand the interactions. And make sure that all of your specialists know what you're taking, so that you can look for things that are probably not going to provide you any benefit whatsoever, and would only contribute downside risk. Because I think that the - I was on the Peter McCullough protocol, which I think is a great protocol, I mean it's highly highly effective for preventing blood clots, and for eliminating any blood clots that you might have. It turned out that wasn't my problem. Because I was just taking it thinking that, you know there was no harm in taking it. But because I had a retinal condition and because for whatever reason my doctor didn't realize that I was taking these three supplements, my retinal bleed was the mother of all retinal bleeds. And the first thing that happened when I ran into my - the first surgeon that I saw, he said <span class="quote">'what blood thinners are you on?'</span> And I said I'm not on any blood thinners but I think I know what you're talking about."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5av9p9-vsrf-live-139-first-responder-whistleblowers.html>https://rumble.com/v5av9p9-vsrf-live-139-first-responder-whistleblowers.html</a>, time 41:10]</p>
<p>Kirsch said he was taking three supplements, so it probably meant McCullough's Spike Detox protocol because it consists of three supplements which are nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin, which all have anticoagulant properties. The paper where McCullough described his protocol said this about nattokinase: <span class="quote">"Because of the risk of bleeding, patients must be strongly cautioned to seek medical supervision with combining this nutraceutical with concurrent antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs."</span> [<a href=https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf>https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf</a>] And the paper also said this about curcumin: <span class="quote">"Patients should be counseled and monitored for bleeding complications including easy bruising, nasal mucosal bleeding, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage."</span> And the conclusion of the paper said: <span class="quote">"Patients need close monitoring because of anticoagulant effects."</span></p>
<p>While I have been researching Twitter bots, I have noticed that a large number of accounts I suspected to be bots have promoted McCullough's Spike Detox supplements and other products sold by The Wellness Company.</p>
<p>For example here <a href=https://x.com/thehealthb0t>thehealthb0t</a> posted an advertisement for the Spike Detox protocol, which was retweeted by the bot <a href=https://x.com/Ellenng2013>Ellenng2013</a> which posts in Chinese:</p>

<p>An account called <a href=https://x.com/Sky_Raelian>Sky_Raelian</a> which promotes Raelianism has 840 tweets but they're all retweets. I'm not absolutely sure if it's a bot but it seems to repost a similar set of accounts that are reposted by bots that promote Raelianism. However here Sky_Raelian retweeted a video by Thekeksociety where McCullough advertised the Spike Detox product:</p>

<p>A user called <a href=https://x.com/linman1>linman1</a> had 2,779 tweets but almost all of them were retweets. There were only 11 non-retweet tweets returned by Twitter's search, but one of them was an advertisement for McCullough's Spike Detox protocol and another tweet was a reply to an Elon Musk fan account: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Alinman1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Alinman1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>An identical tweet which promoted Spike Detox was also posted by an account called unitedweare11: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22dr+mccullough%27s+vax+spike+protein+detox+protocol%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22dr+mccullough%27s+vax+spike+protein+detox+protocol%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>linman1 also retweeted this tweet by TWC which advertised Spike Detox:</p>

<p>When I scraped the reposts of linman1 up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets, it had the most reposts for William Makis who was on TWC Canada's chief medical board, and Vigilant Fox ranked 4th:</p>

<p>Added in July 2025: Peter McCullough did a video with some other guy sponsored by TWC where they demanded that TV ads for pharmaceuticals must stop. McCullough said he doesn't need to go to a pharmacy because he's a member of TWC so he gets prescription drugs for free from TWC, and he said the products sold by TWC are even covered by some health insurance plans. And he said that someone has diabetes or hypertension, they should not visit a hospital but they should get the premium elite membership at TWC instead. He said the TWC's field kit saved the life of a guy on his African safari trip, and he said everyone should use TWC's nose spray twice a day so they don't get COVID: [<a href=https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/why-television-drug-commercials-must>https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/why-television-drug-commercials-must</a>]</p>

<p>A user called <a href=https://x.com/PKikos>Paul Kikos</a> said that this clip of a speech by RFK Jr. was urgent as if it would've been a recent video: [<a href=https://x.com/PKikos/status/1831976683865583847>https://x.com/PKikos/status/1831976683865583847</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-kikos-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>However the video was almost 3 years old because it was from the Defeat the Mandates rally in January 2022. [<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-speech-defeat-the-mandates/>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-speech-defeat-the-mandates/</a>]</p>
<p>I think the avatar of Paul Kikos was probably generated by AI:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-kikos-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Paul Kikos also has a LinkedIn profile which uses the same picture. It doesn't have any education listed and the only job he has listed is that he worked for a year at a mineral exploration company in 2012 to 2013: [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-kikos-614a5021/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-kikos-614a5021/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-kikos-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>For some reason the description under his name still says <span class="quote">"Field Technician @ Rum Jungle Resources (now called Verdant Resources)"</span> even though presumably his profile would've been updated after he stopped working at the company in 2013. But I didn't find any more information by googling for a combination of his name and the name of the company in double quotes.</p>
<p>Paul Kikos said that a Substack post by someone called Stephen Reason was <span class="quote">"my latest Substack piece"</span>. However Stephen Reason only posted a similar tweet where he linked to his Substack about 23 minutes later:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-kikos-5.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>Paul Kikos seems to have copied many tweets from Telegram, so at first I thought he might have also copied Stephen Reason's post from Telegram. However when I searched for the text of another tweet by Stephen Reason in double quotes, it had also been posted by another user before it was posted by Stephen Reason, and the other user said it was <span class="quote">"my article"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22My+article+on+Australia%27s+proposed+National+Digital+ID+was+published+in+The+Light+Australia%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22My+article+on+Australia%27s+proposed+National+Digital+ID+was+published+in+The+Light+Australia%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-kikos-4.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>In the case of both pairs of tweets shown above, the tweet by Stephen Reason had slight differences to the tweet posted by the other user. So if the other user manually edited the tweet after copying it from Stephen Reason, why did the other user keep the text which said it was <span class="quote">"My article"</span> or <span class="quote">"My latest Substack piece"</span>?</p>

<p>In the video clip that was posted by the accounts shown below, John Bell who was one of the developers of the AstraZeneca vaccine said: <span class="quote">"These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilize a population. They're very likely to have an effect which works in a percentage - say 60 or 70%."</span> He was talking about sterilizing immunity which means that viral replication is completely prevented by the immune response, as opposed to protective immunity where the replication is reduced but not eliminated completely. The original video was from August 2020. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1TaIqy91Y&t=186s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1TaIqy91Y&amp;t=186s</a>]</p>
<p>The video clip was posted 3 times by John O'Looney who said that Bell was talking about sterilizing people. It was also posted by Jim Ferguson, James Thorp, Sudden And Unexpected, Shadow of Ezra, Sophia Dahl, and by many accounts that promote Miles Guo. James Thorp who is on TWC's chief medical board wrote: <span class="quote">"A 60 to 70% risk of infertility is certainly consistent with many experts observations. I'm sorry you didn't achieve what appears to be your apparent desired effect of sterilizing the entire population."</span> Some accounts that normally tweet in English posted versions of the video with Chinese or Spanish subtitles:</p>

<p>Sean Adl-Tabatabai also tweeted a video about the story. When I searched for a part of text of his tweet in double quotes, the first user who had posted the same text was an account whose pinned tweet was about Miles Guo. Its location was set as Spain, but it posted in a mixture of English and Chinese and it only had a couple of tweets in Spanish:</p>

<p>In August 2024 The People's Voice published an article about a paper where Young Mi Lee and Daniel Broudy claimed that they found <span class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like"</span> structures in COVID vaccines. The article was titled <span class="quote">"Japan Declares State of Emergency After <span class="quote">'Nanobots'</span> Found in 96 Million Citizens"</span>, even though the main text of the article didn't mention anything about Japan declaring a state of emergency or nanobots being found in 96 million citizens, and neither was even mentioned in the original paper. [<a href=https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/>https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/</a>]</p>
<p>Two of the earliest accounts that tweeted about the TPV article seemed like they had an AI-generated avatar. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495>https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495</a>, <a href=https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567>https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567</a>] One of the accounts portrayed a black man from Ghana who for some reason was posting about American political topics. The ear and shoulder on the left side of his avatar image are blurred even though the front of his face and the curtain on the background are not blurred, so the image looks like it has some kind of an artificial blur effect and not a real blur produced by the lens of a camera (but similar patterns of blur seem to be common in AI-generated 3D portrait images). The avatar of the white man is even more clearly fake, and the tufts of hair on the left side of the photo are also blurred:</p>

</div>
<p>The user Camus posted a tweet where it claimed that vaccinated children in ages 10 to 14 had about 45 times higher all-cause mortality than unvaccinated children, even though actually it was only children in the group <span class="quote">"Third dose or booster, at least 21 days ago"</span> who made up only about 0.5% of the total person-years of vaccinated people. [<a href=https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1834270020270260262>https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1834270020270260262</a>] In the comments of the tweet I saw a user called <a href=https://x.com/DeborahGinn10>DeborahGinn10</a> whose avatar appeared to be AI-generated, but it also has a pattern of blur where the hair and ears are blurred, and even the neck is heavily blurred:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-3d-1.jpg width=600><img src=i/bot-3d-3.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>The verified followers of DeborahGinn10 included a MAGA account called <a href=https://x.com/JackMenshaw>Jack Menshaw</a>. When I googled for the name Jack Menshaw in double quotes, there were only 4 results which were all about the Twitter account. His avatar appears to be AI-generated, and for example the hair and the shoulder on the left side of the photo are blurred (and often in these photos the hair looks like it's somehow too rigid or it's not flowing freely enough):</p>

<p>Added in December 2024: The username of JA_strategist has now been changed to ActivistJerry. Many of its newest tweets promoted Elon Musk:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-ghanamusk.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Added in January 2025: Replies to this tweet that promoted MyPillow were posted by two users with an AI-generated near-realistic avatar: [<a href=https://x.com/Gregjh1964/status/1876662627566604412>https://x.com/Gregjh1964/status/1876662627566604412</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>This account looked like its avatar was generated by thispersondoesnotexist.com, but the account posted a reply that was related to the content of a recent podcast so the reply seemed like it might have been posted by a human (because in the podcast Jack Kruse debated Calley Means whose sister was one of the main topics discussed during the podcast): [<a href=https://x.com/Kate_Jones1234/status/1872546220725727519>https://x.com/Kate_Jones1234/status/1872546220725727519</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>I also found this account which has a video of Denis Rancourt pinned and which posted a lot of retweets of Rancourt and replies to Rancourt: [<a href=https://x.com/NjecThun>https://x.com/NjecThun</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-4.png width=500>
</div>
<p>However the second account had posted a link to a Twitch stream where it referred to the content of the stream, which again seemed like a human-posted tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/NjecThun/status/1852902831725908186>https://x.com/NjecThun/status/1852902831725908186</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>So I don't know if there's just some real people who generate an avatar with a service like thispersondoesnotexist.com. But on the other hand both accounts had over 10,000 tweets which increases the likelihood that they might be bots (even though I found both accounts because they replied to a thread I was reading, so by that method there's a bias where I'm more likely to find accounts that post more tweets).</p>
<p>But it's also unusual how the other account described itself as an <span class="quote">"Adult Human Female"</span> in its bio which would be a weird way for a real person to describe themselves:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-2.png width=300>
</div>
<p>I found the account called <a href=https://x.com/nmrapport>nmrapport</a> below because someone retweeted one of its tweets, which had gone semi-viral even though the earliest tweet by the account had been posted only 9 days earlier. The account mostly posted about the issue of H-1B visa workers which was a hot topic at the time:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-6.png width=500>
</div>
<p>nmrapport had only 5 followed accounts which consisted of 4 medium-sized MAGA accounts and an account called <span class="quote">"USTechWorkers"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-gan-7.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The avatars of all three accounts have eyes located at nearly the same position as other images generated by thispersondoesnotexist.com:</p>

</h2>
<p>Naomi Wolf quote tweeted this video where James Thorp said that vaccinated women had an 82% miscarriage rate, even though over the previous few weeks both Wolf and Thorp had been repeatedly shown why the claim was false: [<a href=https://x.com/naomirwolf/status/1930039123361911117>https://x.com/naomirwolf/status/1930039123361911117</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolf-1.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>Naomi Wolf wrote that the story about the 82% miscarriage rate <span class="quote">"was broken in our report, the <span class="citation" data-cites="WarRoom/DailyClout">@WarRoom/DailyClout</span> Pfizer Documents research team, in 2023"</span>. Wolf used to be regularly featured on Steve Bannon's War Room show.</p>
<p>The tweet she quoted was posted by toobaffled, so I pointed out that the same kind of bots that promote Bannon and Guo also promote accounts like toobaffled that post video clips from the fake alt media, like SenseReceptor, newstart_2024, Humanspective, and wideawake_media. These are tweets I found by searching for <code>lang:zh naomi wolf</code>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-wolf-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The account <a href=https://x.com/hongyinongchang>hongyinongchang</a> quoted videos of Naomi Wolf posted by both SenseReceptor and Humanspective. I'm not sure if it's a bot, but its banner image mentions Miles Guo's Himalaya Korea organization. When I scraped its reposts up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets, these were the accounts it had reposted at least 8 times:</p>
