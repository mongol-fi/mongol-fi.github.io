<p>The table below is a complete list of people I could think of who claim to have seen the calamari clots in either dead or living people. I tried to link to the earliest source where each person made the claim, but in some cases I may have missed some earlier sources, and if for example a video was posted on multiple platforms, I didn't bother checking which platform the video was uploaded to earliest. I tried to find UTC dates when possible, but some dates are in an unknown timezone.</p>

<p>Morticians like Hirschman have said that their colleagues have also seen the clots, but on the list above I did not include second-hand testimony that someone else had seen the clots unless the testimony of the person was the main topic of a video or a post, or unless for example the person is supposed to have released photos or videos of the clots. In the table above people with only second-hand testimony available are the anonymous embalmer whose video was posted by Daniel Horowitz in April 2022, the anonymous embalmer whose photos were shown by Jane Ruby in June 2022, the daughter of the Twitter user chansurance, and Tom Haviland's cath lab whistleblower. Some anonymous sources in my table might be duplicates of other sources in my table.</p>
<p>I only included people in my table who claim to have seen the clots in the body of a dead or living person, so my table is missing people who claim to have seen the clots when they analyzed the clots in a lab, who include Mike Adams, Ana Maria Mihalcea, Clifford Carnicom, Zandre Botha, Arne Burkhardt, Greg Harrison, Kevin McCairn, David Hunt, and Kevin McKernan.</p>
<p>Tom Haviland has a jar of clots he shows during interviews, but I didn't include him on the list above because I don't know if he claims to have personally seen the clots in the body of a dead or living person. John O'Looney also has a jar of clots that he shows around to people, so people who have interviewed O'Looney or Haviland in person might have also seen the jars, but I did not include those people on my list.</p>
<p>Arne Burkhardt is the only person I can think of who claims to have seen calamari clots but who does not come from an English-speaking country (even though I believe he didn't say he had personally seen the clots inside the body of a dead or living person).</p>
<p>In the table above, 2 out of the first 3 people who claim to have seen the clots did their first interview with Steve Kirsch. I believe Kirsch also did Hirschman's second interview after Jane Ruby. And the Died Suddenly movie featured about 7 minutes of footage of Steve Kirsch, which was the second most footage out of any person after Richard Hirschman.</p>
<p>In my table 5 out of the last 7 people all claim to have seen the clots in living people, but as far as I can tell, none of them said before 2024 they had seen the clots in living people. There are only two people I can think of who had claimed before 2024 that they had seen the clots in a living person: one of them is the anonymous ER doctor who was interviewed by Mike Adams on InfoWars through a voice changer, and the other is Leunis van Rooyen who was presented by Jane Ruby as a member of a team of surgeons who had removed a calamari clot from the leg of a living person.</p>

</h3>
<p>Richard Hirschman did his alt media debut on the Jane Ruby Show in January 2022. I haven't found any reference to a new type of white fibrous clots that predates his interview.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby brags that she broke the news about the clots, but she also brags that she was the first person to break La Quinta Columna's story about graphene oxide in English-language media: [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952</a>, <a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-jane-ruby-breaking-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Hirschman wrote this about his clots in 2023: <span class="quote">"If it wasn't for people like Dr Jane Ruby, Stew Peters, Mike Adams, Maria Zeee and several others, hardly anyone would know. Dr Jane Ruby was the first one to interview me and sharing this to the world."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1690094446426157056>https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1690094446426157056</a>]</p>
<p>When Hirschman appeared on the Jane Ruby Show, her show used to be part of the Stew Peters Network, which is notorious for promoting disinformation stories about strange objects benig found in vaccines or in the blood of vaccinated people, including hydras, microchips, nanobots, graphene oxide, snake venom, hydrogel, robot arms, shards of glass, neanderthal DNA, and gorilla feces. I call the stories <span class="quote">"Stew ops"</span>, because the origin of the stories frequently goes back to the Stew Peters Network or to guests on their network. Stew Peters also says that the earth is flat and viruses are not real.</p>
<p>I believe the FEMA whistleblower Celeste Solum was the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel, but she has also said that COVID vaccines contain gorilla feces and Neanderthal DNA: [<a href=https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7>https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-gorilla.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The director of the Died Suddenly film was Stew Peters, the producer was Lauren Witzke who at the time was Stew's producer, and the editor was Nicholas Stumphauzer who was hired by Witzke and Stew to do their movies. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221122001654/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/live-world-premiere-died-suddenly/>http://web.archive.org/web/20221122001654/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/live-world-premiere-died-suddenly/</a>] Previously the same team produced a film called <span class="quote">"Watch the Water"</span>, where Bryan Ardis claimed that COVID was caused by snake venom in tap water (which Stew's people said was a <span class="quote">"truth satan himself has fought to suppress"</span>): [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221105032849/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/04/world-premiere-watch-the-water/>http://web.archive.org/web/20221105032849/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/04/world-premiere-watch-the-water/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-kalamari-watchwater.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>But anyway if the calamari clots are caused by COVID vaccines, then why was the story about the calamari clots only breaking news in January 2022? When I searched Twitter for the query <code>embalmer clot until:2022-1-27</code>, I didn't find a single reference to the calamari clots that predated Hirschman's interview with Jane Ruby. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=embalmer+clot+until%3A2022-1-27&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=embalmer+clot+until%3A2022-1-27&amp;f=live</a>] I only found a few tweets which linked to an article from September 2021 titled <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'The Clots Were The Size Of Pancakes'</span> - Texas Embalmer Opens Up About Covid Horrors"</span>, but the article didn't discuss the new type of white clots that Hirschman is supposed to have found. [<a href=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-covid-embalmers-patrick-huey_n_612feb0be4b0aac9c012139c>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-covid-embalmers-patrick-huey_n_612feb0be4b0aac9c012139c</a>]</p>
<p>I also searched BitChute for the keywords <span class="quote">"funeral director"</span> and <span class="quote">"embalmer"</span> and I sorted the results by oldest first. There were several conspiracy videos posted in 2021 that featured morticians, but I didn't find any reference to a new type of white clots in the videos. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=funeral+director&sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=funeral+director&amp;sort=old</a>] John O'Looney already did a lot of videos in 2021, but didn't say he had seen calamari clots until June 2022.</p>

<p>I believe the first three people in alt media who interviewed Hirschman were Jane Ruby, Steve Kirsch, and Daniel Horowitz.</p>
<p>I think Kirsch was also the first person who interviewed Anna Foster and Cary Watkins, who to my knowledge were the next two people after Hirschman who said in public that they had seen a new type of white clots.</p>
<p>Daniel Horowitz also published early photos and videos of clots that I haven't seen published elsewhere earlier. [<a href=https://x.com/RMConservative/status/1513673923174539264>https://x.com/RMConservative/status/1513673923174539264</a>, <a href=https://x.com/RMConservative/status/1519475175527526401>https://x.com/RMConservative/status/1519475175527526401</a>, <a href=https://gettr.com/post/p1hroyce14c>https://gettr.com/post/p1hroyce14c</a>]</p>
<p>During an interview that Hirschman did with Australian National Review, he said that Wayne Crouch and Lisa Johnston from ANR were among the first people who interviewed him, even though their interview with Hirschman was published about 8 months after Jane Ruby's first interview with Hirschman. So I wanted to check how many other people interviewed Hirschman in between, but I was only able to find 4 other people, who were Steve Kirsch, Daniel Horowitz, Mike Adams, and Maria Zeee:</p>

<a href=#Interview_with_Daniel_Horowitz_in_February_2022 id=Interview_with_Daniel_Horowitz_in_February_2022>Interview with Daniel Horowitz in February 2022</a>
</h3>
<p>In February 2022 Hirschman was interviewed by Daniel Horowitz, who I believe was the third person who interviewed Hirschman after Jane Ruby and Steve Kirsch. [<a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493</a>]</p>
<p>At time 36:13 Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"John O'Looney is in the UK - he's not one of the three I'm referring to, but he's the first person - he's a funeral director that came out - and I saw a video of him last October or so. And what he described - what they're seeing over there, which he didn't put no pictures or anything - but his story of what he was seeing was almost identical to what I was seeing. And I did, you know, I did hear John O'Looney recently was asked about these kind of clots, and he said his embalmer has been struggling with this for several months now."</span> However I believe O'Looney never said he saw the new type of white clots until late June 2022.</p>
<p>At time 44:26 Horowitz said: <span class="quote">"You don't have any confirmed cases of seeing these crazy clots in someone that you know to be unvaccinated except for one case. Could you talk about that?"</span> And then Hirschman answered: <span class="quote">"Yes, there was a case that I - I was certain that this person was vaccinated by the way the blood looked. And that person wasn't and, - but then I found out, you know, that person had other medical issues, and so had received a blood transfusion."</span> I think normally embalmers don't have access to the vaccination status or medical history of people they embalmed, so did Hirschman learn from a family member that the deceased person had received a blood transfusion? If he's a trade embalmer who travels from funeral home to funeral home, was he even present at the funeral home at the same time as the family of the deceased person, or did he just ask for their phone number from the funeral home or something? Or did people from the funeral home tell him about the blood transfusion, or did Hirschman ask people from the funeral home to ask the family members about the medical history?</p>
<p>Hirschman also didn't explain how he was able to tell if a person was vaccinated from the way the blood looked. Was he able to tell it with a naked eye or did he look at the blood under a microscope? Were there some other attributes of the blood besides the clots which showed him that a person was vaccinated?</p>
<p>At time 49:50 Hirschman said that James Thorpe told him: <span class="quote">"You know, these big clots are alarming, but that doesn't scare him. What scares him the most are the microclots. The micro clots, the small tiny ones. Because he's afraid what happens with those small ones is they're going to end up finding their way to certain organs throughout your body and start restricting blood flow causing certain organ failures and other complications. So when when he told me that, I stopped and I said, <span class="quote">'Excuse me, doctor. Let me explain something - when I'm embalming a body, sometimes when I'm embalming and the blood is draining, it looks like - it almost looks like coffee grounds, little tiny specks of dark material coming out with the blood.'</span> He said, <span class="quote">'That's what I'm talking about. Those are microclots. And those are dangerous because those can cause a heart attack and a stroke as well.'</span>"</span> But I think the microclots that Resia Pretorius and Douglas Kell have discussed are not visible with a naked eye, even though I don't know if it might be possible for microclots to accumulate into a clot that would be large enough to be seen with a naked eye. [<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8381139/>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8381139/</a>] But Pretorius and Kell said the microclots they described were caused by COVID, and <span class="quote">"coffee ground"</span> clots were already seen before COVID. I don't remember Hirschman having equated the coffee ground clots with microclots in his later interviews.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added later: Tom Haviland's embalmer surveys have also included this question which equated coffee ground clots to microclots: <span class="quote">"Did you observe any <span class="quote">'micro-clotting'</span> in the corpses that you embalmed in Year 2023, as evidenced by the appearance of <span class="quote">'coffee grounds'</span> or <span class="quote">'dirty blood'</span> in the drainage?"</span> [<a href=https://www.skirsch.com/covid/EmbalmerSurvey2023.pdf>https://www.skirsch.com/covid/EmbalmerSurvey2023.pdf</a>]</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Interview_by_Mike_Adams_on_InfoWars_in_June_2022 id=Interview_by_Mike_Adams_on_InfoWars_in_June_2022>Interview by Mike Adams on InfoWars in June 2022</a>
</h3>
<p>In June 2022 Richard Hirschman told Mike Adams: <span class="quote">"Well I was asked earlier today by somebody who would like to speak to you, and he was asking if I could - you know, did I send samples of normal blood clots, and - to compare against normal blood clots. But I don't - I don't have anything like that. It seems like the clots have all changed. And I don't know what normal is anymore with the strange stuff that I'm seeing."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Jw4nZtJXw5BK>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Jw4nZtJXw5BK</a>, time 28:21]</p>
<p>But it doesn't make sense that he no longer had any normal blood clots. Was he not even seeing normal blood clots in unvaccinated people? Laura Jeffrey claimed that the calamari clots were often attached to currant jelly clots so that the calamari clots seemed like they were feeding off the currant jelly clots, so doesn't that mean that at least some embalmers were still seeing the currant jelly clots?</p>
<p>In the 2023 embalmer survey, only about 4% of the respondents are supposed to have answered 0% to a question that asked <span class="quote">"What percentage of the corpses in Year 2023 that you have embalmed have had traditional <span class="quote">'grape jelly'</span> blood clots?"</span> [<a href=https://www.skirsch.com/covid/EmbalmerSurvey2023.pdf>https://www.skirsch.com/covid/EmbalmerSurvey2023.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>During the same interview, Mike Adams asked Hirschman to send another sample of clots to him, and he said <span class="quote">"By the way, just to honor the dead here. We are - you know, these people died, we believe from these clots. And I believe that if they could speak, they would want us to tell the world and sound out the alarm. And I don't want anyone out there to think, you know, that we are exploiting the tissues of these dead people for any kind of sensationalism."</span> [15:18]</p>
<p>Even though that's exactly what Mike Adams did, when he claimed that the clots contained <span class="quote">"nanowire interface structures"</span>, and the clots contained electric circuits which may have made it possible to track people in a similar fashion as RFID chips, or which would've made it possible to kill people remotely by 5G or DEWs, or which would've caused people to die if there was a solar flare.</p>
<p>Has Hirschman ever even said if he received consent from the families of the dead people to take samples from the dead bodies and send the samples all over the world? It seems like something embalmers wouldn't be allowed to do.</p>
<p>Brenton Faithfull said that he didn't have any photos or samples of the clots because embalmers were not permitted to photograph dead bodies or remove samples from the bodies (even though the practice in the United States might be different from New Zealand): <span class="quote">"We've got to take into account the anonymity of of of patients. I don't have the authority to even photograph a deceased person, you know. The ethical dilemma that we face is as professionals - I think even permission to embalmer body is sought from a family - is in part of the contractual arrangements. And it's very loose, I think, most funeral homes have the same clause to perform any sanitary preservation in their judgment required, within the contract. Now that's a very loose term. Now, we don't have a license to practice anatomy, so technically we can't remove any samples. We're not allowed to."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1odcne-new-zealand-funeral-director-brenton-faithfull-first-interview..html?start=1754><a href="https://rumble.com/v1odcne-new-zealand-funeral-director-brenton-faithfull-first-interview" class="uri">https://rumble.com/v1odcne-new-zealand-funeral-director-brenton-faithfull-first-interview</a>..html?start=1754</a>]</p>

<p>I now listened to an interview that Hirschman did with Wayne Crouch and Lisa Johnston in September 2022. He said that Mike Adams had found that the clots were <span class="quote">"some form of self-assembling material. Exactly what, you know, we don't know. He did find large amounts of tin in these clots. He found large amounts of aluminum and sodium - which he all - he says all of those are conductive elements.

Like not a natural occurrence."</span> And Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"Exactly. Now, people need to remember he has a lab - it's a credited lab, so you know, who am I to dispute what he has found. He's made it public. He's willing for everybody to look at it. If anybody wants to replicate this, they're welcome to do it. And that's how we get moving forward. So I'm glad he did it. It sounds science fiction to talk about, you know, ele-. These things that seem to be conductive in nature. That sounds really really hard to swallow. But great let's - let's somebody prove him wrong."</span> Then Wayne Crouch said: <span class="quote">"Well, he's always been right in the past. I mean, the guy really is a genius. And as you say, he has got one of the most amazing labs. Like he doesn't play games. When he puts out a story, he really researches the hell out of what he's about to-."</span> [32:36] Then Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"Mike Adams has got the lab analysis. It is what it is. I mean, he can't go in there and manipulate that. That stuff is dissolved, and it is - goes through that plasma machine or whatever it is that he has, and it reads the elements. It is - that's just what it is."</span> [35:42]</p>
<p>So I guess in a way Hirschman expressed scepticism about Mike Adam's findings when he said they sounded like science fiction and they were difficult to swallow. But on the other hand he stated it as a fact that Mike Adams <span class="quote">"can't go in there and manipulate"</span> his lab results.</p>

<a href=#Interview_by_Ana_Maria_Mihalcea_in_February_2024 id=Interview_by_Ana_Maria_Mihalcea_in_February_2024>Interview by Ana Maria Mihalcea in February 2024</a>
</h3>
<p>Richard Hirschman was interviewed by Ana Maria Mihalcea in February 2024. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html>https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html</a>]</p>
<p>Mihalcea said that when she looked at Hirschman's sample of coffee ground clots under a microscope, <span class="quote">"I saw that stuff was moving, and you see that these round little spheres are actually developing here. And if I speed this up, it is actually growing. And the spheres contain these little tiny blinking lights that I call quantum dot micro robots, which is the same stuff that we saw in the Pfizer vial."</span> [32:09] And she said: <span class="quote">"And these little blinking lights, there may be 500 nanometers or something like that. And they change colors from blue to yellow to red, which is exactly what quantum dot micro robots do. So this is technology for biosensing application."</span> [33:36] And she said that when she looked at a sample of unvaccinated blood, it also contained the blinking lights, and it contained hydrogel that formed rubbery filaments, which she said was due to shedding. And she said calamari clots are formed when nanobots eat red blood cells: <span class="quote">"And they are literally changing the red blood cells. They're sucking the blood dry, taking its energy, which in the nanotechnology literature - this is called energy harvesting for intra body area network. Nothing in the body is supposed to blink like this. So these are biosensors, and look at their swarming. This isn't natural, this is all technology basically, you know. And so what happens is if I just observe this stuff over a long period of time, you see that these bots literally eat up the red blood cells until nothing is left of them. This is literally forming the clot before my eyes."</span> [35:19] And she said 30 minutes later the bots had harvested all the electricity and life force out of the blood cells, so only a skeleton of cells was remained, where the skeleton was connected by hydrogel polymer plastic rubber. Next she said: <span class="quote">"The rubber stuff is made from these filaments that Clifford Cardicom calls cross-domain bacteria or Morgellons filaments. They grow out of those little round things and become larger."</span> [38:04] And she said the rubber was what the rubbery clots were made out of.</p>
<p>After that Hirschman didn't have anything critical to say about Mihalcea's findings but he just moved on to the next topic. Later Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"I had a live blood analysis of my own blood and my blood had some of those filaments in it too."</span> [56:26] But it's not clear if by filaments he meant Morgellons filaments like Mihalcea.</p>
<p>At the end of the video Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"I don't like the infighting and stuff like that between people that are on our side trying to get rid of the shots. Have compassion on those folks. Some people get all upset if you don't want to call it what they call it. They may call it amyloid, you may call it a hydrogel, you know, nanotechnology, all these different things. And you know I think we need to hopefully - hopefully we all will come together and realize - I mean you got some pretty daggum solid proof behind you when you're showing the actual images, you're showing the blinking lights. Look, people can replicate this if they want to. They can replicate it."</span></p>
<p>So Hirschman said that these microscope photos of blinking lights were <span class="quote">"pretty daggum solid proof"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-blinking.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Hirschman did his interview with Mihalcea more than half a year after Mihalcea had published her analysis of Hirschman's clots, where she claimed that the clots contained Morgellons fibers and Morgellons bacteria. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230711070359/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/blood-clot-analysis-from-living-and>http://web.archive.org/web/20230711070359/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/blood-clot-analysis-from-living-and</a>] If Hirschman was for real, wouldn't he have realized that Mihalcea was a fraud? Other people probably also told him about how Mihalcea's analysis was fake. So then why did he agree to do another interview with Mihalcea later on? And why did he say that the light microscope photos of quantum dots were <span class="quote">"pretty daggum solid proof"</span>?</p>

</h3>
<p>During an interview in 2024 when O'Looney was asked when he first started seeing the new type of blood clots, he answered: <span class="quote">"So, really, in 2021, about halfway through, we started seeing lots and lots of people who were passing away suddenly, who were a lot younger than those that we were used to."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&t=10s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&amp;t=10s</a>] And a bit later he said this about the calamari clots: <span class="quote">"I've got a BIE-registered embalmer who works for me full time, who's done 22 years, and he's never seen them before, uh, 2021, no."</span> And the interviewer said: <span class="quote">"So some people have think they've seen some small ones in 2020, but that's not your experience: it's 2021 they started, midway through 2021."</span> And then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"Yes, 100%, yeah."</span></p>
<p>However I didn't find O'Looney mentioning the calamari clots anywhere in 2021. During an interview on September 30th 2021, the only time he mentioned blood clots was when he said: <span class="quote">"Children will get cardio issues, inflammation of the heart. There will be blood clots and all the things I'm seeing as a funeral director. Now as a funeral director I'm seeing four main causes of death coming into me now. I'm seeing heart attack and stroke as a result of blood clot."</span> [<a href=https://antijantepodden.com/.ajp_enep026.html>https://antijantepodden.com/.ajp_enep026.html</a>, 24:59] But he didn't say anything about a new type of white rubbery clots. And also in a video that O'Looney did in December 2021, he said: <span class="quote">"We used to see a blood clot very very rarely, but now I've seen more this year than I have in the previous 14."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/</a>, time 0:58] But again he didn't say anything about a new type of white clots. And in another interview of O'Looney dated September 1st 2021, he didn't mention any kind of clots. [<a href=https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html>https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html</a>]</p>
<p>There were 16 tweets which matched the search phrase <code>from:olooneyjohn until:2021-12-31 clot</code>, but none of them mentioned anything about a new type of white clots.

</h3>
<p>The earliest tweets I found which referred to O'Looney talking about calamari clots were from late June 2022: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=john%20o%27looney%20clots%20until%3A2022-8-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=john%20o%27looney%20clots%20until%3A2022-8-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-looney-early.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The oldest BitChute video I found where O'Looney spoke about calamari clots was dated June 30th 2022 UTC, even though there were about 600 older BitChute videos that matched John O'Looney's name. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=%22john+o%27looney%22&sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=%22john+o%27looney%22&amp;sort=old</a>]</p>
<p>In the video O'Looney said the following: [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn9R5OkfTRNW>https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn9R5OkfTRNW</a>, 2:21]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a guy in today who obviously - I can't give too much detail respect for him and his family - but he was 30 years old, triple-jabbed, and he had a post-mortem. So the family asks us to get him embalmed. And when that happens, basically they remove all the organs and put them in a plastic bag when they've done what they need to do - take samples and weigh them and look at them - and then they put them back in the body cavity and sew them up. So we have to undo that. And that then gives you obviously considerable access to that body from the inside.</p>
<p>And you could see all the crap hanging out of his arteries, this white stringy like. It's like a - I watched a report a little while ago from a guy called Richard Hirschman who's an embalmer in the US, and he mentioned about this, and he showed it to everyone. And there's a number of videos illustrating what it is, because we thought it was blood clots that were killing people. It's not. There's some sort of white crap that's growing inside people's arteries and it's phenomenal. It was honestly chilling to witness.</p>
<p>And I pulled it out of - every artery this guy had was chock-a-block full of stuff - the femoral artery, the radial artery, the carotid artery in the neck - literally you're pulling it out like spaghetti. And it grows inside the arteries, when it grows to - I mean, his aorta was literally jam packed full of it. What it is, I really don't know. It's very elastic. And it obviously cuts down the bigger it grows - it cuts down the blood supply to everywhere, and these people drop down dead, you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So O'Looney made it seem like he was not normally seeing calamari clots, but the reason why saw them in the case of the 30-year-old man was because the man had gotten a post-mortem examination. It's also interesting that O'Looney only said there were calamari clots in arteries, even though Hirschman says that the clots are approximately equally common in arteries and veins.</p>
<p>O'Looney also told the same story on a video panel which featured Sam Dubé, Daria Schooler, and the <span class="quote">"former European forces member Maverick Black"</span>. A video of the panel was published on July 6th 2022 UTC, but I don't know if the video was recorded earlier. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN/</a>]</p>
<p>At time 27:01 O'Looney was asked <span class="quote">"How long after death did you remove this material?"</span> But he answered <span class="quote">"He passed away on the 19th, so again 8 days."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN>https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN</a>] So O'Looney appears to say that he first saw calamari clots on June 27th.</p>
<p>Next O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"I've never, ever seen it before, ever in 15 years of doing embalmings and opening people up and seeing the inside of them. This is something very unique. I've heard of being reported that we've struggled to embalm people for about 18 months now - who are job recipients. Now, usually they're what was called a one-pointer for doing embalment. And the way that goes is we go in the carotid artery, and we make an incision halfway through. And an L-shaped pump is put in to pump formaldehyde round one way, using the arterial system. They then take that out, tie artery off, and go in the top to do the rest of the head. Now, one incision is usually enough - unless this person is very old and was diabetic, perhaps, and known to have poor circulation, then you would have to make - but every one of them now is what's called a six-pointer, so we have to go in both sides, both arms, and both femoral arteries as well. Because you just can't get the fluid round them. And I would suggest that's because their arteries are full of that."</span></p>
<p>At time 56:54 O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"It's not a very invasive process. You rely really on someone coming through who's had a post-mortem, because then you're going to open up the cavity and you're going to seal all these arteries that have been cut, and down - you're going to be able to look down them. And that's how we really discovered it with this guy. You know, people that haven't had a post-mortem - you're not opening them up as such, you're just making one incision. So, you know, they become apparent that they probably have got this. I knew what I was going to find because we struggled to embalm people for some time, to the point where we suspected the pump might need servicing. But it's got a pressure gauge on it that shows there's nothing wrong with the pump. It's the people's circulatory system blocked. And I knew what we would find. I kind of pre-warned Maverick before we did it. And I suspected what we'd find, and lo and behold it was there."</span></p>
<p>So this time O'Looney explicitly said that he saw the calamari clots for the first time only now, even though he said his funeral home had earlier had trouble embalming bodies because the vessels were blocked by the clots. However it conflicts with the story of other embalmers like Hirschman, who say that the calamari clots get pushed out along with the blood when the embalming fluid is pumped in, or they get removed by a vacuum suction device. So are the clots more sticky in England than the United States, so that they remain attached to the walls of blood vessels in England but not in the United States? Or did O'Looney not use the kind of suction device that was used by Hirschman?</p>
<p>During one interview Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"Well, as we're pushing fluid in, and we're not getting fluid into - like say, we'll just pick on the left arm - left arm's not getting fluid - and we can tell by the color of the arm - and so we're forced then to raise and an like an axillary or brachial up in the armpit or in the upper arm - to find the artery that feeds that limb, okay. And as I cut into the - open the artery up, I began to - you could see there was a clot inside."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1o6sik-embalmer-richard-hirschman-the-ultimate-interview-with-photos-and-explanati.html?start=552>https://rumble.com/v1o6sik-embalmer-richard-hirschman-the-ultimate-interview-with-photos-and-explanati.html?start=552</a>] So if O'Looney or his embalmer was not able to pump embalming fluid to some part of the body because the blood vessel was blocked by a calamari clot, weren't they able to tell it from the color of the part of the body that was blocked, and couldn't they have made the incision near the blocked spot so they could remove the clot with the foreceps?</p>
<p>O'Looney even said that <span class="quote">"every one of them now is what's called a six-pointer, so we have to go in both sides, both arms, and both femoral arteries as well"</span>. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/aDoOHVuKWEtN/</a>, time 28:20] So if his embalmer had to made six incisions, wasn't there even one time when they made one of the incisions close enough to a spot where a calamari clot was lodged that they would've been able to pull out the clot with the foreceps?</p>
<p>From O'Looney's video panel, I didn't understand why he was communicating with the <span class="quote">"former European forces member Maverick Black"</span>. Maverick Black has a channel on Odysee but the only video on the channel is the video he did with O'Looney. [<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;MAVERICK:8b?view=content>https://odysee.com/@MAVERICK:8b?view=content</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Added later: In the comment section of a video where Hirschman removed a calamari clot from a corpse, O'Looney posted a comment in April 2022 where he wrote <span class="quote">"as a fuenral director i cna tell you this is 100% authentic, we too see the same issue here in the uk"</span> (but it's not clear if he meant he was seeing the clots himself): [<a href=https://rumble.com/v11qcta-unbelievable-blood-clots-video-from-embalmer-richard-hirschman.html?e9s=src_v1_upp#comment-108862323>https://rumble.com/v11qcta-unbelievable-blood-clots-video-from-embalmer-richard-hirschman.html?e9s=src_v1_upp#comment-108862323</a>]</p>

<img src=i/clot-olooneyrumble.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Later on June 9th 2022 UTC O'Looney posted another comment where he didn't say anything specifically about a new type of clots, but he wrote: <span class="quote">"Since they began jabbing is has proved more difficult to get the fluid around the bodies. The fluid is pink in colour and as such you can see when it reaches the finger tips and extremeties - that is the idea. It adds a natural pink look to what would otherwise be a very pale body. Quite often now these jab receipients are so blocked up we cannot get the fluid through them and then have to manually use a syringe to inject the areas manually. This isnt normal and my embalmer has been talking about this since about feb/march of 2021 when large numbers of dead jab receipients were coming into the funeral home and we struggled to get them embalmed, they ended up being something called a <span class="quote">'6 pointer'</span> and that refers to 6 arteries raised to get them embalmed where normallly it is just one artery used to do the whole body, now it takes up to 6 and then manually hyperdermic syringeing them as well to get fluid in them fully."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v11qcta-unbelievable-blood-clots-video-from-embalmer-richard-hirschman.html?e9s=src_v1_upp#comment-121093563>https://rumble.com/v11qcta-unbelievable-blood-clots-video-from-embalmer-richard-hirschman.html?e9s=src_v1_upp#comment-121093563</a>] But again why did the embalmer never remove the calamari clots that blocked the vessels, so that O'Looney did not see the clots until June 2022?</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Interview_on_InfoWars_in_March_2024 id=Interview_on_InfoWars_in_March_2024>Interview on InfoWars in March 2024</a>
</h3>
<p>In March 2024 John O'Looney was on InfoWars. When Alex asked O'Looney when he first started seeing the new clots, he answered <span class="quote">"in 2021 - early 2021 - I saw a video by a guy called Richard Hirschman"</span>, and that soon after that he started seeing the clots himself. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4gnag3-alex-jones-2-of-4-friday-3124-john-olooney-mortician-links-covid-jabs-and-b.html?start=652>https://rumble.com/v4gnag3-alex-jones-2-of-4-friday-3124-john-olooney-mortician-links-covid-jabs-and-b.html?start=652</a>] But of course Hirschman wasn't even doing videos until January 2022.</p>
<p>At time 25:30 O'Looney said that <span class="quote">"there were no extra deaths in 2020"</span>. Even though if you look at monthly excess ASMR for England and Wales at Mortality Watch, 3 out of the 5 months with the highest excess ASMR since 2020 the start of were in 2020, and the month with the highest excess deaths was by far April 2020. [<a href=https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=GBRTENW&ct=monthly&e=1&df=2020%2520Jan&bm=lin_reg>https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=GBRTENW&amp;ct=monthly&amp;e=1&amp;df=2020%2520Jan&amp;bm=lin_reg</a>] O'Looney's funeral home is located about 50 miles from London, and the area of London was hit particularly hard during the COVID wave in the spring of 2020.</p>
<p>At time 20:23 O'Looney said he has had a bunch of people in their 40s and 50s dying of cancer. But in reality cancer mortality among people in their 40s and 50s has not been elevated in England since the vaccine rollout. [<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1844420592453427663>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1844420592453427663</a>]</p>
<p>At time 27:04 O'Looney told a story about how he was invited to a secret meeting in London (akin to the whistleblower who told Bill Ryan about the Anglo-Saxon Mission):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in September of 2021, I took a call from a guy called Mark Sexton, who's a retired police constable here in the UK. He invited me to meet in Westminster, a place called Birdcage Walk. So I attended this meeting in September - the 28th, I believe - of 2021. And present at the meeting were professor Dolores Cahill, Dr. Tess Lawrie, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, Dr. Steven Frost, Dr. Sam White, a lawyer and a debissare, and Philip Hylen, a barrister called Francis Hall, and a minister, very senior government minister by the name of Sir Graham Brady. Now Sir Graham is the commissioner of something called the 1922 Committee - and politics vary from country to country - but this is a guy who's the commissioner of a group of men who hire and fire prime ministers in this country, so there is no one above him politically.</p>
<p>So we all had five minutes because their time is precious. And I abbreviated basically what I've kind of skimmed over what I've said. And I then listened as it went round the table, all tenents told Sir Graham Brady their concerns.</p>
<p>And I'll be honest, I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. <strong>They said that people that have had an active ingredient will die between years two and five. And that there was no cure if they'd had an active ingredient.</strong> My jaw was on the on the table.</p>
<p>Then Sir Graham actually openly admitted it was above his pay grade, and he could do nothing about it. And he said whilst he would try, he couldn't promise anything. And at the end of the meeting, it was put to him by a number of us that when people find out what you've done, there will be civil unrest the like that we've never seen, there will be civil war. I'm still convinced there will be civil war if we don't stop this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then at time 33:46 O'Looney suggested that there were many large prisons constructed in the UK because dissidents were going to be jailed during the next pandemic, which he predicted would happen shortly after May 24th 2024. And he said 5G would be used to trigger symptoms of sickness in vaccinated people whose bodies contained graphene oxide and nanotechnology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, there are two major things that concern me. I mean, I'm 56 years old. And I've seen many governments come and go. They all make manifesto promises they never ever keep.</p>
<p>Well, one of those promises is successive home office ministers have promised to ease prison overcrowding. They've never ever done anything about that. And yet they've chosen a time when they're - allegedly we're in the middle of a deadly pandemic - and we have the worst economic downturn since World War II to build loads and loads of huge multimillion pound prisons, huge super prisons in the middle of a pandemic and the worst economic downturn. You know, why would we need huge super prisons?</p>
<p>The other thing of real concern is the 5G network has gone up now. Now, I've skimmed over the technology. I've spoken to many people who have reached out to me, who tell me <strong>this 5G network can - has the ability to influence nanotech and graphene oxide</strong> that is inside jab recipients, so that when certain frequencies are put out, it can induce adverse reactions in these recipients.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I believe that's going to happen shortly after May the 24th. And you know yourself Alex, these people are saying this. They're crazy. They're into numerology. And I'm kind of wondering if it will be perhaps the 6th of June, or something like that, where it has real resonance with that. I think shortly after they install the who, they're going to declare another pandemic. And they've got the numbers now to be able to do that. And then we will see real tyranny across the western and developed world.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>So I believe that come May the 24th, it's going to get very dystopian very quick. And you'll be aware yourself, these rats, they know the game is up. They know that the great reset is suddenly be morphing into the great awakening. So with that, these people have become particularly dangerous as they thrash about in the death throes of their plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O'Looney said that the bodies of people whose death was attributed to COVID were filled half full of fluid, because their kidneys had stopped working because of remdesivir poisoning: <span class="quote">"What was happening in 2021, I was picking people up from an hospital - I was told <em>had</em> COVID, they died from COVID - and the body bag was like half full of fluid. And I've never ever seen that before in all my years. And I remember thinking at the time, <span class="quote">'What could that possibly be? Why is that? Why is that like that?'</span> And they were all bloated, they were crying, yellow tears. And from the nose and from the ears. And even being generous, as you can't pull in the deceased over, you would mark them where, you know - because they're so bursting with fluid. And I've since found out, the remdesivir kills the kidneys so the body can't process fluid. So you fill up with fluid and you drown. And there's your respiratory illness, there's your COVID."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/svO5GNPHwaqC>https://www.bitchute.com/video/svO5GNPHwaqC</a>, 40:40] But his story doesn't seem believable at all. Has anyone else reported similar pathology associated with remdesivir poisoning? Why would the remdesivir victims be <span class="quote">"crying yellow tears"</span>?</p>
<p>What did O'Looney even mean with fluid, blood? Or lymph or water? Lymph is yellow in color, and there is a surprisingly large amount of lymph because a typical amount of lymph in an adult human body is about 1.5 liters. But ChatGPT said that AKI would not lead to buildup of lymph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) <strong>does not directly cause</strong> a buildup of lymph, but it <strong>can lead to fluid overload</strong>, which may resemble or contribute to <strong>swelling (edema)</strong> that looks similar to lymphatic buildup in some cases.</p>
<h3 id="what-aki-does-cause">What AKI does cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decreased urine output</strong> (oliguria or anuria)</li>
<li><strong>Retention of fluids and electrolytes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Edema</strong> - especially in the legs, around the eyes, or even the lungs (pulmonary edema)</li>
<li><strong>Increased blood pressure</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-aki-doesnt-directly-cause">What AKI doesn't directly cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lymphedema</strong>, which is swelling due to <strong>blocked or damaged lymphatic vessels</strong>, is not directly caused by AKI.</li>
<li><strong>Lymph accumulation</strong> typically results from problems in the <strong>lymphatic system</strong>, not the kidneys.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <strong>severe AKI</strong> can worsen <strong>fluid retention</strong>, and if someone already has <strong>impaired lymphatic drainage</strong>, that excess fluid may further overwhelm the system and contribute to noticeable swelling.</p>

<p>O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"One guy that reached out to me called Nick - who's a mortuary manager at a big hospital down south here - he's seen a five to six hundred percent increase in what he thinks are thrombosis deaths. They're not, it's the - your arteries filling up with this white crap, that behaves like a thrombosis. What does a thrombosis do? It blocks veins and arteries and stops blood flow. That's what this stuff is doing, so they automatically label it as a thrombosis."</span> [37:27]</p>
<p>However based on the data for England at Nomis, deaths with an underlying cause of thromosis or embolism were only slightly elevated in 2021 (and it might have been due to COVID and not vaccines): [<a href=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/161.1/advanced.aspx>https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/161.1/advanced.aspx</a>]</p>

<p>Next O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"In the last 18 months I've looked after more people under 50 years old than I've ever seen, ever. To give you an idea, when I worked for the co-op, I could count the amount of people on one hand under 50 that died in a 12 month period. And this was, in a branch, doing about eight hundred, seven-eight hundred funerals a year. Now I've had that many, sometimes in a month, as a small family funeral director."</span> [39:58]</p>
<p>However based on data for England from Nomisweb, ages 0 to 49 had only about 8% more deaths in 2021 than 2018, and even less deaths in 2022 than 2021:</p>

<p>I was initially sceptical about Covid but I can confirm it's validity and it is very nasty. But I can also tell you it is 100% man-made this is not a natural virus and this is an attack on all of us - it's a bio weapon.</p>

<p>Covid vaccinated individuals contain dormant nanopathogens in their bodies that can be activated by an 18 gigahertz signal on the 5G network, according to a Pfizer insider who reveals that once triggered, these pathogens can cause catastrophic health effects, ranging from sudden heart and brain explosions to uncontrollable bleeding from every orifice.</p>

<p>Jim Ferguson is promoted by the same kind of bots that promote accounts like John O'Looney, toobaffled, and SenseReceptor. But here O'Looney retweeted a tweet about graphene oxide by Jim Ferguson:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ferguson-go.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In July 2021 O'Looney posted a TikTok video of a guy who was supposed to be a 5G installer, who said that his job was to install 5G kits which he was told to not crack open. But when he tried opening one kit, it contained a circuit board which said <span class="quote">"COV-19"</span>.

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-kalamari-5g.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>However Reuters said this about the 5G video: <span class="quote">"The circuit board was actually taken from a Virgin Media box for cable television - the casing of which can be seen on the bonnet of the van as the camera pans at the end of the footage. Virgin Media confirmed to Reuters it believed the circuit board had been taken from an old TV box, and the <span class="quote">'COV-19'</span> engraving was not authentic."</span> [<a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/>https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/</a>] So it might even be that the people who made the video left the casing of the box visible so the video would be easier to debunk.</p>

</h3>
<p>In June 2022 Jane Ruby said that an anonymous embalmer had contacted her and sent her photos of clots they had taken. This was one of the photos she showed: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v196g5d-live-new-embalmer-steps-forward-with-horrific-post-jab-clots.html?start=1145>https://rumble.com/v196g5d-live-new-embalmer-steps-forward-with-horrific-post-jab-clots.html?start=1145</a>]</p>

<img src=i/clot-anonymous.jpg width=600>

<p>The photo looks suspiciously similar to Richard Hirschman's photos, because even the glove has a similar blue color as the gloves in Hirschman's photos. When I searched Google Images for <span class="quote">"embalming glove"</span>, a lot of gloves were yellow or orange or white or black. And even blue gloves often had a different shade of blue than the gloves in the photos by the anonymous embalmer and Richard Hirschman:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-embalmer-glove-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>I tried searching Google Images for <code>embalmer mortuary</code> and I picked photos where a glove was clearly visible. I excluded duplicate photos of the same person, and I excluded photos that looked like staged stock photos where the people may have been actors. I also excluded one photo that showed embalming students, one photo of a person who was shown in the role of a funeral director and not an embalmer, and one grayscale photo where it was not possible to determine the color of the gloves. Out of the first 12 photos that passed my criteria, only 5 out of 12 people in the photos had blue gloves, even though 2 of the people had gloves that looked like a lighter shade of blue than Hirschman's gloves:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-glovegoogle.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>In September 2024 Hirschman posted this photo of a clot which he said he received from an anonymous embalmer, but the glove in the photo had a similar shade of blue as the gloves of Hirschman and the anonymous embalmer interviewed by Jane Ruby. The photos by both anonymous embalmers even had a vignette effect where the edges of the photo had been made darker, and they employed an effect of local enhancement of contrast similar to an unsharp mask filter with a high radius (even though I guess it's possible that both anynymous embalmers were the same person): [<a href=https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1832561722743259646>https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1832561722743259646</a>]</p>

<p>Below you can see the photos by Jane Ruby's anonymous embalmer and Hirschman's anonymous embalmer side by side with one of Hirschman's own photos.

</div>
<p>When I did a reverse image search for the photo by Jane Ruby's anonymous embalmer, I found that the photo was included in an article by New Tang Dynasty from September 2023, where it was given this caption: <span class="quote">"A series of <span class="quote">'white fibrous clots,'</span> Richard Hirschman pulled out of a body. <span class="quote">'They are similar to calamari. The white stuff is in your face, like 'something is wrong,'</span> Mr. Hirschman said. (Courtesy of Mr. Hirschman)"</span>. So NTD presented the photo as a photo by Hirschman, even though Jane Ruby said it was a photo by an anonymous embalmer who corroborated what Hirschman was saying: [<a href=https://ntdca.com/exclusive-embalmers-speak-out-on-unusual-blood-clots/>https://ntdca.com/exclusive-embalmers-speak-out-on-unusual-blood-clots/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-anonymous-2.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The article by NTD was originally published by Epoch Times but it's behind a paywall at Epoch Times. [<a href=https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/exclusive-embalmers-speak-out-on-unusual-parasite-blood-clots-5121795>https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/exclusive-embalmers-speak-out-on-unusual-parasite-blood-clots-5121795</a>] Epoch Times and NTD are both run by Falun Gong, whose leader declared himself as the Lord Buddha of the Universe (宇宙主佛) who was several times higher than Buddha and Jesus. He also claims that disembodied alien souls have taught humans how to develop technology so that humans will build clones which can be inhabited by alien souls, and then the aliens will trick humans into outlawing natural reproduction, so only clones that are inhabited by alien souls will be left on the earth.

<p>The article by Epoch Times included comments by several people, who were Richard Hirschman, John O'Looney, Ryan Cole, <span class="quote">"Dr. Roger Hodkinson, CEO and medical director of Edmonton-based MedMalDoctors"</span>, <span class="quote">"Sarah, who is going to school in Wisconsin to get her funeral director's licence"</span>, and <span class="quote">"Carolyn, a funeral home director in Ontario with more than 25 years of embalming experience"</span>. There was no source given for the comments by any of the people, so the people appear to have been interviewed by Epoch Times.</p>
<p>When I searched for text in the Epoch Times article in double quotes, I found that parts of a similar article had earlier been posted on some random website in late 2022. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206095726/https://pennybutler.com/funeral-directors-covid/>https://web.archive.org/web/20221206095726/https://pennybutler.com/funeral-directors-covid/</a>] The source linked on the website was a document at Google Docs, which seems to have been a draft version of the article that was later published by Epoch Times. [<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk</a>] The document was created in October 2022, but the author of the document is not shown anywhere:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-anonymous-4.png width=1000>
</div>
<p>The draft version of the article at Google Docs said: <span class="quote">"Three embalmers provided photographs they personally took of the clots to the <em>Western Standard</em>."</span> But the author of the Epoch Times article was Matthew Horwood, who also writes for Western Standard.</p>
<p>But anyway, the article by Epoch Times also had another interesting parallel with Jane Ruby's video, which is that Jane Ruby's anonymous embalmer said that the calamari clots appeared to be feeding on regular blood clots, which is also what the funeral home director Carolyn said in the Epoch Times article.</p>
<p>The draft version of the Epoch Times article included the following three paragraphs (but the first and third paragraphs were removed from the published article): [<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While normal blood clots are dark brown in colour, Carolyn said the fibrous masses are white. But she said they also have a pinkish tone, as they are <span class="quote">"literally feeding off of blood clots."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"They remind me of parasites, because they're creating a blood clot and they're feeding off it,"</span> she said. <span class="quote">"So every tentacle is basically down a part of the circulatory system, and at the end of those fingers there is a normal clot, and it looks like they're feeding off it."</span></p>
<p>Hirschman also said that the fibrous clots appeared to be feeding off normal blood clots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the video where Jane Ruby showed the photos by the anonymous embalmer, Jane Ruby also showed the photo below and said: <span class="quote">"And notice the red, you know, sort of embedded clot like - you know, these things - these things are not just next to clots, they are actually attached in some cases. You'll see in a minute. And again, this particular embalmer said to me to that effect, and I didn't prompt the embalmer with Mr. Hirschman's comment - remember Mr. Hirschman's said it kind of looks like the white fibrous thing is emanating out of a regular blood clot, like it's feeding out of it. This embalmer - whose picture you're seeing right now, <span class="quote">'Normal, NOT Normal'</span> - said it looks like it's being fed by the blood clot. Like unsolicited on their own, they said this. Uh, I thought that was stunning."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v196g5d-live-new-embalmer-steps-forward-with-horrific-post-jab-clots.html?start=532>https://rumble.com/v196g5d-live-new-embalmer-steps-forward-with-horrific-post-jab-clots.html?start=532</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-anonymous-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>And next Jane Ruby showed the photo below and said: <span class="quote">"This one is, it's number 105. And I called it the fish. Because it's disgusting. And it looks like a fish. And it's really gross. You see how that clot on the right upper - like it's sort of at the top - but sort of the second half to the right - and it's a long, sinewy clot. And it appears to go underneath the white fibrous clot. And it almost has like vessels in the mid center there. And then further up on the top of this piece, it's there is a clot that appears to be under the sheath. Right? Like under a little bit of this thing. And then of course on the bottom part of length wise of this piece, you see this long black - it does look like it's feeding on the blood. And this could be a clue. Because this is the second time an embalmer has said this to me, okay. Really horrific, isn't it?"</span> [14:40]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-horrific.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Apart from Hirschman, Jane Ruby's anonymous embalmer, and Carolyn who was interviewed by Epoch Times, a fourth mortician who has said that the calamari clots appear to be feeding on regular blood clots is Laura Jeffrey. She said: <span class="quote">"Then there's a blood clot that is integrated into the end of those tentacles. It felt like it was a parasite that was feeding off a blood clot that it created in the body. When you think of a parasite, you think - Because it feeds off of something, right? Then you see the jelly clots at the end of this parasite. You see those and you think, <span class="quote">'Are they feeding off us as humans? Out of our circulatory system?'</span> Because they always had the currant jelly integrated at the ends."</span> [<a href=https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf>https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>It seems unusual that four different morticians would use terminology that one type of blood clot was feeding off another type of blood clot. It should be clear that the calamari clots don't even have a digestive system so that they could eat and digest biological material, but both Laura Jeffrey and Carolyn seem to have said that the calamari clots were literally feeding on regular blood clots.</p>

<p>Jeffrey said that the new type of clots reminded her of parasites, and then she said the new type of clots were feeding off the <span class="quote">"currant jelly clots"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time I saw it I thought it was a parasite. We have something called drainage forceps. I use a pair, generally speaking, that are about this long and that have a handle port. You can squeeze them like tweezers, right? So curved tweezers, think of them that way. I use that to pull anything out of the way on the venous side of the body, where you're draining the return blood. And all of a sudden, I was having trouble. I couldn't understand. Then I pulled it out and I went and I kind of - you can turn the drainage forcep and you can see what's in it. I'm sort of like this and I see something that I thought was a tapeworm. Which was weird, because tapeworms shouldn't be in a circulatory system. And then I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, <span class="quote">"Is this a parasite?"</span> Because a tapeworm's a parasite; that looked like a parasite. And it was at that point, maybe, like three, four inches long. That's a small one. But at that point, that was a huge one for me, because I'd never seen this before. This was a whole new anomaly.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Okay. Have you ever seen those erasers that you push out and they're like a pen, but they're a circle? They're round, cylindrical. You think of one of those but then it maybe has a couple of little tentacles of eraser coming out the end. Then there's a blood clot that is integrated into the end of those tentacles. It felt like it was a parasite that was feeding off a blood clot that it created in the body. When you think of a parasite, you think - because it feeds off of something, right? Then you see the jelly clots at the end of this parasite. You see those and you think, <span class="quote">"Are they feeding off us as humans? Out of our circulatory system?"</span> Because they always had the currant jelly integrated at the ends. It's something to see, let's put it to you that way. It's horrific.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laura Jeffrey also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Yes … a regular current jelly clot is often incorporated in the end of the amyloid clot … which is confusing … is it feeding from our blood OR is it simply stopping blood flow and the current jelly clot is created?"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1807896656047636666>https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1807896656047636666</a>]</p>
<p>Normally red clots form in veins and white clots form in arteries, so it would be unusual to see both</p>
<p>Laura Jeffrey seems to have somehow worked together with Tom Haviland and Laura Kasner in running one of their surveys, because in 2024 she tweeted: <span class="quote">"Ret'd USA Major Thomas Haviland amd Laura Kasner have created a World Wide Survey. If you or someone you know has suffered clotting since 2021 and needed Surgery or Catherization because of clots, please take 3 minutes and fillout this survey:"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1829476769222537242>https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1829476769222537242</a>] When someone asked her to link to the survey, she replied <span class="quote">"Working on it!"</span>, and then in another reply she linked to a page for the survey at Survey Monkey:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-jeffreysurvey.png width=500>
</div>
<p>She posted this reply to a video of military personnel marching: <span class="quote">"In the 90s … if we marched like that, we'd be punished. And that was the Airforce Cadets."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1898781555314569324>https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1898781555314569324</a>] So she seems to have been trained as a cadet in the Air Force (even though it's not clear if she later served in the Air Force, or if she meant the Canadian or US Air Force). She also tweeted: <span class="quote">"I wouldn't join any organization that thinks they own my mind, body, heart and soul. The military's medical system kept me out 30 years ago."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1789305430394466661>https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1789305430394466661</a>] Maybe it's just a coincidence, but there seem to be several Air Force people involved with the story about the calamari clots, because Tom Haviland is also a retired Major General in the US Air Force. And the Died Suddenly movie included a long segment about the DMED data that was presented by Theresa Long and Pete Chambers, who are both medical officers in the US Air Force. And supposedly Richard Hirschman was first connected to Jane Ruby by Theresa Long, who found Hirschman by chance because she happened to visit a funeral home where Hirschman was doing embalming.</p>
<p>When I searched for tweets about Laura Jeffrey, I found that her testimony for NCI Canada was posted by SenseReceptor and bambkb, which are both part of a network of accounts that post video clips from controlled alt media and that are artificially amplified by bots: [<a href=https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1645901270463442945>https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1645901270463442945</a>, <a href=https://x.com/bambkb/status/1701720910548307973>https://x.com/bambkb/status/1701720910548307973</a>]</p>

<img src=i/clot-jeffrey-tweet-1.jpg width=500><img src=i/clot-jeffrey-tweet-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Videos of her testimony were also posted by many accounts which promote Miles Guo (which are probably bots, even though Miles Guo's movement also includes members who are known as <span class="quote">"ants"</span> who promote their content on social media in a bot-like manner): [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=funeral+director+laura+jeffery&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=funeral+director+laura+jeffery&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>In another tweet where bambkb wrote about Laura Jeffrey's testimony, he also posted a video of the alternative health practitioner Kelly Blacher. She said that after the COVID vaccines were rolled out, people's blood has contained self-assembling structures that glowed in the dark, and she said: <span class="quote">"And then they are morphed into whatever organism I'm looking at. They look crab-like, or squid, or like something - it looks like tentacles, segmented tentacles, kind of like a spider. But I never saw these things before. Never. And then there's the metallic kind of looking pieces that eventually degrade, but that turn into a living <em>thing</em>."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/bambkb/status/1642948624383352834>https://x.com/bambkb/status/1642948624383352834</a>]</p>

<a href=#Brenton_Faithfull id=Brenton_Faithfull>Brenton Faithfull</a>
</h3>
<p>In 2022 Brenton Faithfull told Matt Shelton that about 95% of people who passed through his funeral home had been vaccinated within two weeks: <span class="quote">"When I started counting in the August of last year, it was one after the other, after the other, after the other. And when I got to 20, there was 19, 19 who had died within two weeks. So carrying on from 20, so the first 20 years, I counted 19 of them, so it's 95%. The next, number was 100% of the people who died had been vaccinated within two. So it depends when the booster has come out, and the first and the second vaccine has come out, and then the booster, it'll go on a wave. So, you know, 100%, and then it'll drop to 90%. So I've got the statistics, 95% of the people who have passed away - through the work that I've done - has been vaccinated with the two weeks."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1lsnnq-brenton-faithfull-funeral-director-speaks-to-dr.-matt-shelton-about-what-he.html?start=978>https://rumble.com/v1lsnnq-brenton-faithfull-funeral-director-speaks-to-dr.-matt-shelton-about-what-he.html?start=978</a>] At time 32:02, Faithfull also said that at the height of the first and second booster rollout, about 95% of all deaths he saw were in people who had been recently vaccinated.</p>
<p>However it doesn't match Barry Young's New Zealand dataset, which includes mortality data for about half of all vaccinated people in New Zealand. It has a very low number of deaths in the first two weeks after vaccination due to the healthy vaccinee effect (because people in hospice facilities or people who are currently ill are advised to not get vaccinated):</p>

a[weeks&gt;=0&amp;!is.na(weeks)][1:10]|&gt;print(r=F)
# weeks dead # deaths by weeks after vaccination

#     4  718
#     5  727
#     6  741
#     7  773
#     8  805
#     9  822
#    10  881</pre>
<p>There is also a low number of deaths during the first two weeks after vaccination in the Czech record-level datasets, in the Medicare data Kirsch received from a source at HHS, and in the English ONS data: [<a href=rootclaim.html#Fenton_and_Neils_miscategorization_bias>rootclaim.html#Fenton_and_Neils_miscategorization_bias</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fenton-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>And anyway if 95% of deaths were in people who had been vaccinated within two weeks, does it mean that there was about 20 times the normal number of deaths? Faithfull didn't mention if deaths from other causes remained stable or not. And in either case around August 2021 when Faithfull claimed that about 95% of deaths were in recently vaccinated people, New Zealand had close to 0% excess deaths:</p>

<p>Faithfull said that after he started keeping records in August 2021, 39 out of the first 40 dead people had been vaccinated within 2 weeks. But he didn't mention if the one remaining person was unvaccinated, or if their vaccination status was unknown, or if they had been vaccinated 14 or more days ago.</p>
<p>So did almost everyone who died due to vaccination die within two weeks from vaccination, so that there were almost no people who died 14 or more days after vaccination? Even though the vaccines were rolled out late in New Zealand, most people aged 60 and above had already been vaccinated by the start of August 2021, and most people aged 18 and above had been vaccinated by the end of August 2021. But ages 60 and above accounted for about 87% of total deaths in New Zealand in 2021, so presumably they would've also accounted for most deaths that were handled by Faithfull's funeral home, and by August 2021 there should've been a lot of people aged 60 and above who had been vaccinated 14 or more days ago.</p>
<p>About two years after the interview with Faithfull, Matt Shelton told Philip McMillan: <span class="quote">"Then we had an embalmer in New Zealand contact us and say, <span class="quote">'Look, I've been keeping a record, and 90% of the deaths that I am working with'</span> - you know, funeral director an embalmer as well - seemed to him to be within - well he was keeping records - they were within two weeks of of being vaccinated. So they were predominantly elderly. But they all had this vaccine history, recent vaccine history. And he was finding these clots in the bodies he was embalming."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&start=23m16s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&amp;start=23m16s</a>] But Shelton didn't express any doubt about the validity of Faithfull's statistics, even though they were completely unrealistic.</p>

<a href=#Nicky_Rupright_King id=Nicky_Rupright_King>Nicky Rupright King</a>

<p>Nicky Rupright King said that she was from South Alabama like Hirschman: <span class="quote">"Richard Hirschman &amp; I were 2/3 Embalmer's in South AL that came forward after John O'Looney in the UK in reference to the fibrinous clots."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1747807818516754826>https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1747807818516754826</a>] The third embalmer she referred to might have been Cary Watkins, who did a short interview with Steve Kirsch in February 2022 where he said that he knew Hirschman and he was also seeing the new type of clots. [<a href=https://rumble.com/vuycmg-embalmer-with-50-years-of-experience-verifies-hirschmans-story.html>https://rumble.com/vuycmg-embalmer-with-50-years-of-experience-verifies-hirschmans-story.html</a>] In January 2024 King wrote <span class="quote">"I can vouch for Richard we have worked together for a few years."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1751830549549719943>https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1751830549549719943</a>]</p>
<p>The only interview of Nicky Rupright King I found was an interview she did with Jason Liosatos in November 2022. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/</a>]</p>
<p>At time 3:01 King showed the photo of a green clot below and said: <span class="quote">"And myself and Richard Hirschman went into the embalming arena, adn worked on this gentleman for four hours. And we were able to get some drainage after a lot of work in massage. And this is one of the fibrodis substances and clots that we actually removed from this gentleman."</span> I don't remember other morticians or Hirschman showing photos of similar green clots (even though King herself said that she had never seen a clot with a similar color before). I also didn't find the photo of the green clot posted elsewhere with reverse image search engines:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-green.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Next King said: <span class="quote">"This one had little pods attached to it that were almost like a rubber substance. And I - if you look to the right of this, to the right of the one - and it's kind of smushed out onto the table - I actually took my finger and pushed down on that one to pop it to see what was inside of it and it just had like almost like a granuline substance. Almost as if you see a fatty piece of a steak that had that granule inside of it. And that is the one on the right that you could see draining down on the table."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/</a>, 8:26]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pods.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In July 2022 Hirschman also showed the same photo of mysterious ball sacks on Jane Ruby's show: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1cfcrx-white-clots-grow-mysterious-ball-sacks-america-is-flying-the-deadly-skies-s.html?start=355>https://rumble.com/v1cfcrx-white-clots-grow-mysterious-ball-sacks-america-is-flying-the-deadly-skies-s.html?start=355</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ballsack.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Hirschman said it was him and not King who popped the ball on the right that had burst open: <span class="quote">"Well, on one side of it, on the right side of the screen kind of close to where the table goes down into a little trough for drainage, I was curious too, it's so I took my finger and I started just kind of lightly pressing on it to see if I can break it up. And it did break up and mostly what it seemed like what was coming out of there was like blood, but it still was kind of the strands were still there."</span> [7:42] Both Hirschman and King specifically even said that the ball they had burst open was the ball that was draining down the table. But I didn't find either King or Hirschman mentioning if they worked together to embalm the body with mysterious ball sacks, like how they are supposed to have worked together to embalm the body with the green clots.</p>
<p>Another unusual thing King said during the interview was that the white fibrous clots started <span class="quote">"started happening in 2022 after the vaccines had been out"</span>. [13:12] So I don't know if she accidentally said 2022 instead of 2021, or if she later changed her story. In 2024 Richard Hirschman said that he began noticing strange clotting issues in early 2021 and he took his first photos of the clots in September 2021, and King replied that <span class="quote">"I have seen the Clots from the beginning as well, &amp; they continue to become worse"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1861978692051726754>https://x.com/Nickyalembalmer/status/1861978692051726754</a>]</p>
<p>King also said she was able to tell whether the people she embalmed had been vaccinated based on the consistency of the rubbery clots: <span class="quote">"We were at times trying to get a toll on who was vaccinated, who was not, to see if we could see a difference. <strong>And most of the time we could tell just by the consistency of the rubbery clots that they were vaccinated.</strong> And if I wait on a family and the person is deceased, I will ask, can you please tell me if they had their COVID vaccine? And nine times out of 10, they've said, yes, they have had the COVID vaccine."</span> [20:03] However she didn't explain how the consistency of the clots differed between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. And she didn't even mention if she had even seen the clots in any unvaccinated people. Richard Hirschman said that he had seen the calamari clots in only two people who he knew were not vaccinated, but they were both people who had received blood products (where his implication seems to have been that the clots were formed due to some substance that was included in the blood of vaccinated people).</p>
<p>King was also telling dramatic stories about dead babies similar to Wesley the funeral director, John O'Looney, and Brenton Faithfull: <span class="quote">"And to speak of fetal demise, after the vaccine had come out, I've seen so many fetal demises. […] And some of these poor babies were just born so deformed that - things I've never seen in my life before. I felt so bad for these parents who were having to come in and plan for funerals or cremations, memorial services, for their children. From eight months, nine months, to giving birth when they're only - the babies only three months old - the deformities that these children had were astronomical."</span> [24:45]</p>
<p>During the interview with Jason Liosatos, Nicky Rupright King also said: <span class="quote">"The time lapse between the people that we know that are vaccinated, because the family will tell us so, and the time of death - you can see a difference in each person as far as this - the size of the fibrinous clots that are growing - you can see if you've been - if in fact they've been vaccinated - let's say two years versus six months - there's a huge difference in the size of these clots. The consistency, the length of them - and as time goes by, we have noticed that they're starting to take route into whatever artery or vein that they're growing in."</span> [37:46] So she seems to have suggested that it might take more than a year for the clots to reach full size, since she said there's a huge difference in the size of the clots between people who were vaccinated 6 months ago or 2 years ago. (Tom Haviland also suggested that it takes six months or more for the clots to grow, which would've explained why morticians only say they started seeing the clots in mid-2021. However what Haviland and King said conflicts with the hypothesis of the endovascular surgeon who sent a letter to McMillan, who speculated that the reason why he wasn't seeing the clots in his patients might have been if the clots formed rapidly right before death.)</p>

</h3>
<p>In February 2023 someone called <span class="quote">"Pistol Packing Pilot"</span> posted a two-part interview of an anonymous embalmer.

However Pistol Packing Pilot also did an interview with Hirschman about two months earlier, which increases the likelihood that the person who played the role of the anonymous embalmer was actually Hirschman. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m29ouzFlkIk>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m29ouzFlkIk</a>]</p>
<p>The embalmer said that there was a very good friend of his who was a pilot for a US airline who died from a heart attack caused by clotting. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m29ouzFlkIk&start=10m33s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m29ouzFlkIk&amp;start=10m33s</a>] Pistol Packing Pilot is also supposed to be <span class="quote">"an Airbus A320 Captain flying for a major U.S. air carrier"</span>, and he has done a lot of videos about how airline pilots are supposedly dying from vaccines, which are similar to the stories promoted by Theresa Long.</p>
<p>At time 12:15 Pistol Packing Pilot asked: <span class="quote">"Are you still seeing the same number of people who are passing away in their 70s, 80s, 90s? Or is it - you're saying the majority of them are 50s and 60s now?"</span> And the anonymous embalmer answered <span class="quote">"Yeah"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Nowadays it's rare to get someone - I mean, you know, if we do a case and you know, they're 75, 78, 81, something in that nature - that's a shock. Whereas used to - that was the norm, and the younger folks were the shock. Unfortunately, we've gotten to where the number of deaths at a younger age are rising, and that's surprising us. It's - I look for by the end of this calendar year for the number of younger deaths to be more than the number of older deaths. And that is unnatural."</span></p>
<p>The embalmers who claim to have seen the white clots often also claim that there is an increased number of deaths in younger age groups, but as a rule they never cite any actual published mortality statistics, and their anecdotal claims are not supported by real mortality statistics. In December 2023 in the United States, the median age of death was 77, and about 67% of deaths were in ages 70 and above:</p>

t2[,median(rep(age,dead))] # 77
t2[,sum(dead[age&gt;=70])/sum(dead)] # 0.6690405</pre>
<p>The percentage of deaths in ages 70 and above was about 65% in 2019, 2020, and 2022, but in 2021 it dropped to about 62% (even though it was partially because there the proportion of unvaccinated people was higher in younger age groups than older age groups, and in 2021 there were still a lot of unvaccinated people who had not yet acquired natural immunity):</p>

</h3>
<p>Laura Kasner is Tom Haviland's assistant who runs a Substack blog called Clotastrophe. In May 2024 she published a written testimony that she supposedly got from a local embalmer from Ohio. [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony</a>]</p>
<p>The embalmer said that he saw the first fibrous clot in March 2021, and that there was also a huge increase in deaths in the spring of 2021: <span class="quote">"It was then that I began talking with some other of my colleagues and acquaintances that also work in the funeral business. Not only are they seeing these white fibrous structures as well, but every funeral home was INCREDIBLY busy, like off-the-charts record number of new calls. If we usually did 20 calls in the month of April, we did 50. The type of busy that everyone is just trying to keep their heads above water and make sure that families are satisfied with their care. Most funeral homes did about the same number of calls in 2020 as we had in years past, if not maybe a three to five percent increase at most, but if this keeps up, this is the real pandemic."</span></p>
<p>However as usual in the case of testimony by the morticians who claim to have seen calamari clots, Laura Kasner's anonymous embalmer did not refer to any actual mortality statistics, and his claim that there was about 2.5 times the normal number of calls in April 2021 is inconsistent with actual mortality statistics.</p>
<p>You can go to CDC WONDER: <a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html.><a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html" class="uri">https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>.</a> Click <span class="quote">"I Agree"</span>, switch <span class="quote">"Group Results By"</span> to month, and select Ohio as the state of residence from the second section. It shows that Ohio had a fairly low number of deaths in April 2021 because there was a low number of COVID deaths:</p>

<p>The Ohio embalmer also had a dramatic story to tell about dead babies: <span class="quote">"We also saw an exponential increase in the number of fetal and infant deaths in 2021. From 2015-2020, you could count on one hand how many fetal deaths we had. It's not something that is very common. But in 2021, we had more than 10 fetal deaths in less than a year. We also had deaths in several month-old babies that were otherwise perfectly healthy. The family chalked it up to SIDS, but we found out later that the breastfeeding mother was given her Covid vaccine just days prior to the death of the infant. And she wasn't the only one that this happened to. 100% of the fetal and infant deaths that occurred in 2021 were born to vaccinated mothers. There were so many red flags occurring that we began asking every single family that we met with whether the deceased (or the mother of the infant) had previously had Covid or whether they had taken the Covid vaccination. We found that the bodies that had these weird clots inside them - about half of them previously had Covid, but 100% were vaccinated."</span></p>
<p>However according to CDC WONDER there was a low number of fetal deaths in Ohio in 2021: [<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/fetal-deaths-expanded-current.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/fetal-deaths-expanded-current.html</a>]</p>

But now after the vaccine rollout, she said that <span class="quote">"the number of sudden deaths is up sharply, the youngest person that I had to take care of was only 21 years (died while getting ready to play rugby, fit and healthy).

<p>Diane's testimony was published at the end of 2024, and in 2024 New Zealand had close to 0% excess deaths. Also New Zealand had close to 0% or even negative excess deaths in the first year after the vaccine rollout, but the excess deaths only shot up in March 2022 when New Zealand was first hit by COVID:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-nzexcess.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Diane also said that she saw lots of turbo cancer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other noticeable difference is in cancer: much more but especially in the young.</p>
<p>Before the vax, my observations were that the time between the first diagnoses and death was at least a year minimum (there were some exceptions), now the majority are less than 3 months.</p>
<p>I looked after a younger person not so long ago, the time between diagnoses and death was 4 days….. there are no words……</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly she also had a dramatic story to tell about dead babies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the dramatic increase in late term miscarriages, and still births, was very obvious.</p>
<p>For example, we usually took care of up to three babies within a two-month period, (which is already too many; one of the hardest aspects of the job). The first week of the vax, we had three babies born dead in the same week!</p>
<p>Were these partners of vaccinated border workers? I don't remember the <span class="quote">'safe in pregnancy'</span> message being pushed until after that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ayurvedic guru Guy Hatchard doesn't appear to be a member of NZDSOS, but NZDSOS praised him as one of New Zealand's best analysts. [<a href=https://nzdsos.com/2023/01/18/hatchard-therapeutic-products-bill/>https://nzdsos.com/2023/01/18/hatchard-therapeutic-products-bill/</a>] In 2023 Hatchard published fake data which he claimed he received from an anonymous whistleblower. In his data the yearly number of hospitalizations for myocarditis was higher than the number of hospitalizations for heart attack even in the years before COVID, even though in reality hospitalization for heart attack is much more common. His data is supposed to have only included the region of Wellington which accounts for about 10% of the total population of New Zealand, but his data still had about 700 to 900 stillbirths per year:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hatchard.png width=550>
</div>
<p>However according to Statistics New Zealand, there have been only about 300-400 recorded stillbirths per year in the entire New Zealand since 2018. [<a href=https://infoshare.stats.govt.nz/ViewTable.aspx?pxID=37ba9dc1-91dd-4470-a605-060ded2c70d3>https://infoshare.stats.govt.nz/ViewTable.aspx?pxID=37ba9dc1-91dd-4470-a605-060ded2c70d3</a>] There was a slight increase in stillbirths in 2022, but it might have been due to random variation since the number of stillbirths was still well within the 95% prediction interval. So the official data for stillbirths is not consistent with the data from Hatchard's whistleblower, and it's not consistent with Diane's anecdotal claim that there was a dramatic increase in stillbirths after the vaccine rollout:</p>

<p>Bill said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"Prior to this - I mean, I've been an embalmer over 30 years - I had never ever seen this - prior to, I'm gonna say July or August of 2021."</span> [time 31:12] Kirsch also asked Lorin Ware <span class="quote">"And you started seeing them in mid-2021?"</span> But she answered <span class="quote">"Yes sir"</span>, and then Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"Was it like a light switch turning on, or did it happen pretty gradually?"</span> And she answered that <span class="quote">"It was like a light switch turning on."</span> [time 26:00] But if embalmers started suddenly seeing the clots in mid-2021 then how come no-one was speaking out about the clots until January 2022?</p>
<p>At time 1:03:11 Kirsch asked Bill: <span class="quote">"What percentage of the cases that you embalmed are - do you believe are due to, uh - we're killed by the vaccine?"</span> And Bill replied: <span class="quote">"I would say over 90%."</span> And Kirsch said: <span class="quote">"Wow. Wow. Ok. That's a showstopper."</span> And a bit later Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"Um, so, so Bill, the 90%: how confident are you?"</span> [1:05:21] And Bill answered <span class="quote">"100%"</span> And Kirsch asked <span class="quote">"100% confident?"</span> And Bill replied <span class="quote">"I am. I can, I guarantee you, I can show you every single person that's been vaccinated."</span></p>
<p>But Bill was a trade embalmer, so how would he even know the vaccination status of the people he embalmed, let alone their cause of death? He said that he worked with multiple funeral homes within a 60-mile area, so did he ask the staff at all the funeral homes to find out the vaccination status and cause of death of the people he embalmed? Was the staff really willing to bother the family members to ask them questions that a funeral home would not normally need to ask? And were they able to find the cause of death with enough certainty that Bill could be 100% sure that 90% or more of the deaths were due to the vaccine? Or was he just sure about it because he saw calamari clots in the bodies he embalmed and he assumed that people with calamari clots died due to a vaccine?</p>
<p>Later during the same interview, Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"I don't get the vaccine status because I'm the trade embalmer. Whether the funeral director wants to ask the family is up to them. We had one recently - there's one funeral director I know and an emembalmer - she was pretty blunt you know she just asked the family. And the family asked her <span class="quote">'Was that necessary to ask for the death certificate?'</span> And she says, <span class="quote">'No, I was just was curious.'</span>"</span> [1:57:36] Hirschman's explanation seems reasonable, because the family members would indeed be asking why they need to tell the funeral home about the vaccination status or death certificate of the deceased person.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Anna_Foster id=Anna_Foster>Anna Foster</a>
</h3>
<p>I believe Anna Foster was the second mortician after Hirschman who said they had seen calamari clots, because her interview with Kirsch was published about 2 weeks after Hirschman's first interview with Jane Ruby.</p>
<p>I found only one other interview that Anna Foster did later on, which was an interview she did with Chris Martenson together with Richard Hirschman.</p>
<p>During the interview Martenson asked: <span class="quote">"These fibrous things we're talking about - the calamari - are these coming out of both veins and arteries?"</span> And then Hirschman replied: <span class="quote">"Yes."</span> And Martenson asked: <span class="quote">"Even-steven?"</span> And Hirschman said <span class="quote">"Yes, exactly."</span> Then Foster said: <span class="quote">"I've only gotten them out of the veins - out of the vein. I haven't seen the arteries."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500>https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500</a>]</p>
<p>So if Foster said she only saw the clots in veins, it seems like a major inconsistency compared to what other morticians are saying.</p>

</h3>
<p>In December 2022 a BitChute channel called Off-Grid Ireland published an interview with the Irish embalmer John McGhee. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/0FudnOuCryag/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/0FudnOuCryag/</a>, <a href=https://transcriberb.dreamwidth.org/194510.html>https://transcriberb.dreamwidth.org/194510.html</a>]</p>
<p>McGhee said he found the clots in arteries but he didn't mention they would've also been common in veins: <span class="quote">"In the arteries I'm finding the clots which you were seeing in that movie, Died Suddenly."</span> [8:28] He also made it clear he had not seen similar type of clots earlier: <span class="quote">"But the clots that are forming now are made of - not composed of blood. That's the thing, that's what's not common. And the consistency and the size - it's just like something that's never been experienced before."</span> [23:14] Normally in the case of both clots that occur in living people and post-mortem clots, white clots are more common in arteries and red clots are more common in veins. So it made sense to McGhee to say that he only saw the new type of white clots in arteries. But other embalmers like Hirchman say that calamari clots are approximately equally common in arteries and veins. And Anna Foster said that she only saw calamari clots in veins but not arteries.

<p>STAND League which is Scientology's equivalent of the ADL wrote this about John McGhee: [<a href=https://www.standleague.org/hate-monitor/exposed/john-mcghee.html>https://www.standleague.org/hate-monitor/exposed/john-mcghee.html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John McGhee was marginally involved as a parishioner of the Church of Scientology Mission of Dublin beginning in 2005, participating in a few introductory services. He was expelled from the Church in 2009 after joining the cyberterrorist group Anonymous.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>For the last two years of his association with Scientology, while pretending to be a member of the Church, McGhee secretly was connected to anti-Scientologists, including members of Anonymous.</p>
<p>In 2009, McGhee's participation in this cyberterrorist group was exposed when he joined hate marches and so-called <span class="quote">"flash raids"</span> against Scientology Churches in England.</p>
<p>While attacking the Scientology religion, he also posted on the Internet a picture of himself having desecrated a Christian cemetery - hanging an Anonymous mask on a gravestone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though STAND League said McGhee only participated in a few introductory services, another article said that he spent about 18,000 GBP on the Church of Scientology.

<p>A document I found on Scribd said: <span class="quote">"Cathy Schenkelberg, 60, is romantically linked to the Irish extremist and embalmer Sean Paedric MacAoidh a/k/a John McGhee. Irish authorities maintain a dossier on MacAoidh, Schenkelberg, and their associates."</span> [<a href=https://www.scribd.com/document/444266008/Cathy-Schenkelberg-Bankruptcy-Papers>https://www.scribd.com/document/444266008/Cathy-Schenkelberg-Bankruptcy-Papers</a>] Schenkelberg is another anti-Scientology activist like McGhee.</p>

<p>Added in June 2025: Richard Hirschman now posted a video of clots he received from John McGhee: [<a href=https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1935080376247971988>https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1935080376247971988</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>I can think of 5 or 6 people who have provided first-hand testimony that they have seen calamari clots in the body of a living person:</p>
<ul>
<li>An anonymous ER doctor who was interviewed by Mike Adams on InfoWars through a voice changer in June 2022. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/xo4DJTBTQg7m>https://www.bitchute.com/video/xo4DJTBTQg7m</a>]</li>
<li>The alternative health practicioner Leunis van Rooyen, who appeared on the Jane Ruby Show in September 2022 as a member of a team of surgeons who had removed a calamari clot from a living person. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1kcwtl-live-7pm-white-clots-pulled-from-the-living.html>https://rumble.com/v1kcwtl-live-7pm-white-clots-pulled-from-the-living.html</a>]</li>
<li>The anonymous cath lab whistleblower who was interviewed by Philip McMillan in February 2024. [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/are-the-embalmers-clots-occurring>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/are-the-embalmers-clots-occurring</a>]</li>
<li>The radiologist Phillip Triantos, who is from Alabama like Hirschman so he appeared in person with Hirschman on a panel hosted by Maria Zeee. He claims he sees calamari clots in CT and MRI scans. The earliest place I found where he said that he saw calamari clots was on Philip McMillan's show in May 2024. [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/embalmers-clots-another-doctor-speaks>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/embalmers-clots-another-doctor-speaks</a>]</li>
<li>Philip McMillan's high school friend Azzard Comrie, who was interviewed by McMillan in February 2025. [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking</a>]</li>
<li>Matt Shelton, who is the sixth person I'm not sure of. Greg Harrison said that Matt Shelton had seen the clots in a living person. [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1910659753061007514>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1910659753061007514</a>] I found one tweet where Shelton said he had stretched calamari clots himself, and he wrote about <span class="quote">"my clots"</span> which may have referred to clots he removed from the body of a living person, but I'm not sure about it. [<a href=https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667>https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit after Philip McMillan was contacted by his cath lab whistleblower, Tom Haviland said that he had been contacted by another cath lab whistleblower, and he showed some photos by the whistleblower that were also posted by John O'Looney on Twitter. But I didn't find include Haviland's cath lab whistleblower on my list because I didn't find personal testimony by him anywhere.</p>
<p>There's also someone called Melanie who claims that she saw calamari clots being formed in a surgical drain tube that was attached to her body after surgery, but she probably mistook regular fibrin clots for calamari clots. I didn't include her on my list, because she didn't have an opportunity to see what kind of clots usually formed in surgical drain tubes before and after COVID vaccines, so she wasn't able to know if the clots she saw were novel type of clots or not.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Leunis_van_Rooyen id=Leunis_van_Rooyen>Leunis van Rooyen</a>
</h3>
<p>The earliest person I have found who claims to have seen a calamari clot in a living person is Leunis van Rooyen, who was interviewed by Jane Ruby in September 2022. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1kcwtl-live-7pm-white-clots-pulled-from-the-living.html>https://rumble.com/v1kcwtl-live-7pm-white-clots-pulled-from-the-living.html</a>] Jane Ruby said van Rooyen was a member of a team of surgeons who had removed a calamari clot from the leg of a living person. But he is an alternative medical practicioner whose PhD degree is in natural medicine, so he doesn't seem like someone who would be performing surgery. [<a href=https://tailorblend.co.za/Web/Practitioner/Details/6620>https://tailorblend.co.za/Web/Practitioner/Details/6620</a>]</p>
<p>When Jane Ruby asked van Rooyen about snake venom, he said that COVID vaccines induce the human body to produce toxic proteins similar to how snakes produce snake venom: <span class="quote">"What happens is that the gain of function genetic therapy causes the body to produce proteins which would be toxic to the body. So I try and imagine for myself being born with some type of a function similar to having glands like a snake, and then these glands produce the protein. So in this case it's just through the metabolic process. So I'm born then with a protein that's - like snake poison is protein, if a spider bites is it's a protein, the same with the most toxic animal we know of - or it's a snail in the sea - and that protein is deadly. So I'm born with this protein produced in my own body by myself to toxify myself. And this is not good at all. Besides this injection, this jab also - professor Dr. Andreas Noack made mention of the graphene hydroxide, which we would like to investigate from the samples we've got from these so-called blood clots or nylon ropes - I would like to subject it now to a mass spectrometer to see if we can see these graphene hydroxide."</span> [20:41] (Where by <span class="quote">"nylon ropes"</span> he meant calamari clots.)</p>
<p>Next Leunis van Rooyen showed a microscope images taken by Zandre Botha, who is another alternative medical practicioner from South Africa like Leunis van Rooyen. In 2021 Zandre Botha showed Stew Peters photos of self-assembling discs she found in a vaccine vial, and in 2022 she showed Jane Ruby microscope photos of snake venom peptides in COVID vaccines. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v24zioe-blood-doctor-reveals-horrific-findings-dr.-zandre-botha-and-stew-peters-10-.html>https://rumble.com/v24zioe-blood-doctor-reveals-horrific-findings-dr.-zandre-botha-and-stew-peters-10-.html</a>, <a href=https://rumble.com/v11zh8o-first-pictures-and-videos-of-snake-venom-peptides-in-bioweapon-shots.html>https://rumble.com/v11zh8o-first-pictures-and-videos-of-snake-venom-peptides-in-bioweapon-shots.html</a>]</p>
<p>First van Rooyen showed the photo below and said <span class="quote">"From this nylon rope I received, I requested that Dr. Zandre to take me into a laboratory and we would look in their microscope at some cells from this. We saw the cells being damaged and typically what I would expect a cell would look like being poisoned from snake"</span>: [27:24]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-rooyen-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>He also showed these photos which supposedly showed Zandre Botha's blood cells before and after exposure to a COVID vaccine:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-rooyen-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next van Rooyen said that COVID vaccines will induce the production of amyloid proteins which might lead to a zombie apocalypse.</p>

<a href=#Anonymous_cath_lab_whistleblower_interviewed_by_Philip_McMillan id=Anonymous_cath_lab_whistleblower_interviewed_by_Philip_McMillan>Anonymous cath lab whistleblower interviewed by Philip McMillan</a>
</h3>
<p>In February 2024 Philip McMillan claimed that he had been contacted by an anonymous whistleblower who worked at a catherization laboratory, where he had removed calamari clots from the bodies of living people.</p>
<p>McMillan did an audio-only interview with the whistleblower, who said: <span class="quote">"But this new white clot issue - which I compare them to calamari or rubber bands, very strong rubber bands that cannot be pulled apart - this phenomenon has started in, um, late 2021. And we have pictures as early as early 2022."</span> [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/are-the-embalmers-clots-occurring>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/are-the-embalmers-clots-occurring</a>, time 7:07] So it seems unusual how he said he only started to see the clots in late 2021, even though the morticians usually say they started seeing the clots in mid-2021 or early 2021.</p>
<p>The whistleblower said: <span class="quote">"We have about 20 on staff, nurses, anesthesiologists, vascular surgeons, radiologists, and, uh, cardiologists - have all witnessed this."</span> [7:58] But if there's several types of specialists who work at cath labs who are seeing the clots, then why are there so few people speaking out about the clots?</p>
<p>McMillan's video also featured his sidekick Dr. Shankara Chetty, who said: <span class="quote">"When we looked at this initially with Mr. Hirschman, I think it was, I was considering whether this is something to do with the hydrogel that's used - hydrogels have been used as tissue clues, that kind of thing for a long time. And I think we need to look at the research around hydrogels and how they interact with other things. Because this - this is not - this is not natural. So it's got something to do with, whatever, I mean, or whatever the nanotechnology that's being used - or the hydrogels, the lipid nanotechnology."</span> [21:52] Karen Kingston and David Nixon also say that the calamari clots are made up of hydrogel, and Sasha Latypova told Jane Ruby that hydrogel is probably incorporated into the clots. [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech</a>, <a href=https://davidnixon.substack.com/p/hydrogel-gelplastic-and-rubbery-clots>https://davidnixon.substack.com/p/hydrogel-gelplastic-and-rubbery-clots</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/</a> (time 40:45)]</p>
<p>At time 16:12 McMillan showed the photo below and asked: <span class="quote">"And was this one of the very stretchy rubbery-like clots?"</span> And the whistleblower said <span class="quote">"Yes sir."</span> But the clot is not even white (even though I don't know if it's supposed to turn white if it's washed of blood):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-4.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>At time 17:15 the whistleblower showed this photo and said: <span class="quote">"That is a lower-leg extremity DVT blood clot. But the reason why they might appear normal - although this one doesn't, the last one did - it's pulled directly from the patient - which still is coated in blood."</span> So his explanation for why the clots are not white does indeed seem to be that the clots are covered in blood:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-5.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Next the whistleblower showed the photo of a pulmonary embolism below. Then McMillan said: <span class="quote">"Now saddle PE's, I mean, they do occur. So it's not as if they don't occur. What about this would have made you concerned?"</span> And the whistleblower asked: <span class="quote">"As far as what, can you repeat?"</span> And McMillan said: <span class="quote">"So was it just a bigger clot or is it actually seeing multiple saddle PE's far more than you would normally?"</span> And the whistleblower answered: <span class="quote">"Yes. We have a big increase on our numbers when it comes to saddle PE. We used to maybe get one every couple of months. Now we're getting a couple every week."</span> So it's not even clear if the whistleblower was saying that the clot he showed was a new type of white clot or not, or if he just it was a regular clot but what made it unusual was that he was now seeing regular clots more often than earlier:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The whistleblower's photo of a pulmonary embolism clot doesn't look too different from regular pulmonary embolism clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The whistleblower also showed the next clot, but it looks the color of a normal blood clot, and it doesn't really look like it would turn white even if it was washed of blood:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-1.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>When McMillan showed the clot below, he circled the part I highlighted with his mouse asked <span class="quote">"Now this again was the white fibrous bit."</span> And the whistleblower replied <span class="quote">"Yes sir."</span> The clot also has a couple of other similar lighter bits, but all of the lighter parts are very small compared to the clots Hirschman has shown. The middle and right clots also look very wide, because they seem to be about 3 inches at the widest part:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cath-6.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The whistleblower also showed a couple of other clots, but all of them just looked like regular red clots. Couldn't he at least have shown photos of the clots before and after washing them of blood? Then it would've been clearer if the clots were actually white or not.</p>
<p>In January 2024 when Philip McMillan interviewed Haviland, McMillan said: <span class="quote">"One of the questions I had was that if the big clots are being formed, I would expect that we would see it on angiograms. And so this is why I had always thought that it occurs primarily, not necessarily exclusively, postmortem. […] If it was causing that much damage, it's difficult to imagine that we wouldn't be seeing it clinically. So I'm trying to get my head around it."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/live/S4Q-vW1tWyo?t=28m32s>https://www.youtube.com/live/S4Q-vW1tWyo?t=28m32s</a>]</p>
<p>But then conveniently in February 2024 McMillan did a video with the cath lab whistleblower, in March 2024 McMillan announced that Haviland had also been contacted by his own cath lab whistleblower, and May 2024 Phillip Triantos told on McMillan's show that he had seen calamari clots on MRI and CT scans. The trend of people seeing calamari clots in living people seems to have started in 2024.</p>
<p>But there's only two people I have found who had said before 2024 that they saw calamari clots in living people. One of them was an anonymous ER doctor who was interviewed by Mike Adams on InfoWars through a voice changer. And the other one was Leunis van Rooyen, who was presented by Jane Ruby as a member of a team of surgeons who had removed a calamari clot from the leg of a living person (but he also spoke to Jane Ruby about graphene oxide and snake venom).</p>

<a href=#Tom_Havilands_cath_lab_whistleblower id=Tom_Havilands_cath_lab_whistleblower>Tom Haviland's cath lab whistleblower</a>
</h3>
<p>In June 2024 Tom Haviland and John O'Looney published photos which they claimed they received from an anonymous whistleblower, who worked as a surgeon at a catheterization laboratory where clots are removed from living people.</p>
<p>John O'Looney posted the photos in this tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1797976412860629014>https://x.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1797976412860629014</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-surgeon-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>O'Looney described the clots as <span class="quote">"white fibrous clots"</span>, but they look more like red, even though I don't know if they would be white if they were washed of blood.</p>
<p>This clot looks like a saddle pulmonary embolism, where the tree-like segments formed in the left and right pulmonary arteries and the segment in the middle formed in the main pulmonary artery which connects the lungs:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-surgeon-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>However the clot doesn't look too different from regular pulmonary embolisms like in this image: [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/farah-al-khitan-533295103_inari-activity-6866910642872336384-75Ki>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/farah-al-khitan-533295103_inari-activity-6866910642872336384-75Ki</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pulmonaryregular.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>In February 2023 which was over a year before the photos were posted by O'Looney in June 2024, one of the photos had already been shown by Ryan Cole on Dr. Drew's YouTube channel. He said that the clot on the left was removed from a living patient but the clots on the right were clots from dead bodies: [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxKO2XkkoGg&start=29m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxKO2XkkoGg&amp;start=29m54s</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ryancoledrew.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The photos by the cath lab whistleblower were posted on Substack by Laura Kasner. She said Tom Haviland recently received the photos <span class="quote">"from a cardiologist who works in a cath lab"</span>, and she said that this photo that had earlier been shown by Ryan Cole showed an <span class="quote">"illiac artery clot removed from the pelvis of a living person"</span>: [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/the-clots-are-still-being-found-a>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/the-clots-are-still-being-found-a</a>]</p>

<p>Laura Kasner wrote: <span class="quote">"Note that these clots appear red. That is because they had just been removed from LIVING persons. These clots are WHITE when rinsed off and look just like the clots being pulled out of the deceased."</span> But the whistleblower should've also shown photos of the clots after they were washed of blood, so people could've seen if the clots were truly white or not.</p>
<p>And why would the same type of clots even look red when they are pulled out of living people but white when they are pulled out of dead people? For example here's one video where Hirschman supposedly pulled out a calamari clot from a dead body, but the clot already had a light pink color as it was being pulled out of the body, even though it was pulled out of an incision that was filled with blood: [<a href=https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1921293864637239781>https://x.com/r_hirschman/status/1921293864637239781</a>]</p>

<p>Greg Harrison claimed that Matt Shelton had seen calamari clots in a living person: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1910659753061007514>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1910659753061007514</a>]</p>

<p>Here John O'Looney wrote that vaccines contain graphene razor blades that are activated by 5G. When someone asked him if we need any more scary stories, Matt Shelton replied <span class="quote">"Well apparently we do Jennine. The white clots are real enough. I've seen and stretched them. Blood looks terrible now."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667>https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667</a>]</p>

<p>Shelton also replied to another user in the same thread that <span class="quote">"I've seen his and others' and my own clots. Stretched them myself."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667>https://x.com/sussdoc/status/1847715403134619667</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However when Shelton said he had stretched his own clots, it as not clear if he meant clots he had removed himself from a living person or something else. So I have not found any place where Shelton had provided unambiguous first-hand testimony that he had seen the clots in a living person. When I asked about it from Matt Shelton and Greg Harrison, I didn't get any answer.</p>
<p>In 2022 Matt Shelton did a video with Maria Zeee where he claimed that vaccines contained nanotechnology and graphene oxide (and as evidence he presented images of nanotechnology that were taken with a light microscope): [<a href=https://rumble.com/vy0fic-dr.-shelton-and-sue-grey-evidence-of-nanotechnology-and-graphene-oxide-in-c.html>https://rumble.com/vy0fic-dr.-shelton-and-sue-grey-evidence-of-nanotechnology-and-graphene-oxide-in-c.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-shelton-5.png width=600>
</div>
<p>This was one of the microscope images that Matt Shelton showed to Maria Zeee. He said he didn't know what the image showed but he said it was not a natural structure, and he said <span class="quote">"The rounding on the corners, you know, this is precision, um, there's some sort of an algorithm to produce them"</span>: [41:25]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-shelton-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>At the start of the video Shelton said that his team started researching graphene and nanobots after they had been contacted by a patient who had become magnetized after vaccination. And then he mentioned that his work was following in the footsteps of La Quinta Columna and people in Arne Burkhardt's pathology conference: [10:04]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, it was actually in response to having some patients contact us who found that they had become magnetized after their vaccination. So we had a look and met some people who, you know, indeed did seem to show some magnetism. And we - so we did a science report - we did a little research project, and came across La Quinta Columna and the work that they had done. And in fact, Dr. Campra had already done his very high-level science report where he had shown the presence of graphene-based, you know, microstructures, you know - the word nano was used, but now I refers to, you know, incredibly small scale, you know, you're almost down at the sort of molecular level - whereas he and his team were seeing things down a microscope. So as part of the report to the government on people's magnetism concerns, we included what we'd found around the graphene contamination and apparent chips and, you know, electronic circuitry also it seemed.</p>
<p>And shortly after that, a German team of pathologists had a very powerful conference that they recorded and uploaded. And that's well worth everybody looking at. And that was in two parts. In the first half, they were describing the post-mortem findings and people who died after vaccination. And they were reporting things that they'd never seen in their whole careers. And in the second half, they were talking about particles that had been found on microscopy of the vaccine itself. So we first told government at the end of September last year that this stuff was emerging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was talking about Arne Burkhardt's so-called <span class="quote">"pathology conference"</span> which was held in the offices of Burkhardt's private practice in September 2021. Burkhardt's pathology conference was divided into two halves, where during the first half Burkhardt showed his pathology slides, but during the second half other people showed microscope images of vaccines and the blood of vaccinated people. I believe Burkhardt never published any proper written report about his findings, but he just published videos to a mass audience where he showed scary microscope images, just like what the nanobot and graphene crew was doing. People in Burkhardt's conference were saying that vaccines contained minirobots, graphene oxide, and a parasite called <em>Tryponasoma cruzi</em>, and that the blood of a vaccinated person contained a synthetic fiber that may have been a Morgellons fiber. [<a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>] Burkhardt's conference featured Viviane Fischer and it was presented as a press conference similar to the press conference larping operations of Reiner Füllmich, so at first I thought the conference was organized by Füllmich, but I didn't find Füllmich being involved with the conference. (And Burkhardt's conference is also notable because it's where the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was first introduced. The term was specifically used the lawyer Elmar Becker, who was a member of an organization called Lawyers for Enlightenment that was cofounded by Füllmich. Becker conveyed an anecdote about turbo cancer from the German alternative medical practicioner Ute Krüger, who claims to have access to <span class="quote">"energy field technology"</span> so that she is able to detect imbalances in the energy field which is the <span class="quote">"non-material part through which the body and soul communicate"</span>.)</p>
<p>Matt Shelton has also been interviewed by Phillip McMillan. So far Shelton is possibly one of 4 or 5 people I have found who have personally claimed that they have seen calamari clots in a living person, but all except one of the people have been interviewed by McMillan. During the interview with Shelton, McMillan said: <span class="quote">"Once you speak about embalmers' clots, you get put into a category of a conspiracy theorist. Now the question is, if you take that one step further, and you go into the category of vaccine nanobots, you are therefore an ultra conspiracy theorist. Now, I am saying this because I just recently did a video on this paper that was produced by two people - one in South Korea one in Japan - about changes or things in the vaccine."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&start=37m12s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&amp;start=37m12s</a>] Then McMillan and Shelton discussed the nanobot paper by Youngmi Lee and Daniel Broudy in the journal IJVTPR, but they presented the paper in a positive light.</p>
<p>Shelton said this about Daniel Broudy: <span class="quote">"I know Daniel, and he actually has a very important, um, professional background, um, that's that's far more relevant than than his linguistics. But he is as a you know a goldmine on the way that language is used, um to propagandize, um you know, and force ideas and arguments onto people. And I think that it was very important that somebody like him had a kind of an oversight into you know the structure of the paper."</span> [44:44] I don't know if by Broudy's relevant background he meant Broudy's background in military intelligence. And anyway it's really reassuring how Broudy is an expert on how language is used to propagandize and force ideas and arguments onto people.</p>
<p>In 2022 the journal IJVTPR published a paper about nanobots by Daniel Broudy and Valerie Kyrie, where Broudy and Kyrie cited a video by Matt Shelton about nanobots in COVID vaccines. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49</a>] Valerie Kyrie's bio says that she works <span class="quote">"in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that <span class="quote">"her doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>.</p>
<p>Shelton is a cofounder of NZDSOS (New Zealand Doctors Speaking Out with Science), which posted a tweet that promoted An Unholy Triad. [<a href=https://x.com/nzdsos/status/1894285548929650831>https://x.com/nzdsos/status/1894285548929650831</a>] Shelton was credited as one of the three executive producers of An Unholy Triad along with Brenton Faithfull and Wayne Crouch's cohost lady Lisa Johnston. And he was also credited as a member of the <span class="quote">"scientific research and advisory team"</span> of the videos along with Greg Harrison, Bruce Rapley, Daniel Santiago, Andrew Zywiec, and Gerry Brady.</p>
<p>Shelton also promoted An Unholy Triad on Twitter:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-shelton-6.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Matt Shelton claimed that vaccinated people were magnetic. But an article about the clots by NZDSOS said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"But perhaps, like the temporary magnetism in some vaccinated, and the self assembling microtech - supported by a considerable scientific literature - these topics seem too outlandish for many people to contemplate."</span> [<a href=https://nzdsos.com/2024/02/20/rubbery-clots-campbell/>https://nzdsos.com/2024/02/20/rubbery-clots-campbell/</a>] The article also said that the clots were <span class="quote">"gel/plastic"</span> according to David Nixon: <span class="quote">"Another term gaining momentum is gel/plastic, as coined by NZDSOS member David Nixon who is doing very important work at his <a href=https://davidnixon.substack.com/p/gelplastic-and-rubbery-clots>microscopy substack</a>."</span></p>
<p>The NZDSOS member David Nixon has claimed that he has found microchips and robot arms in vaccines under a microscope. During ane interview he did with Maria Zeee, Zeee said: <span class="quote">"I want to ask you, Dr. Nixon, because it looks like little robot arms, even."</span> [<a href=https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/>https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/</a>, time 8:52] Then Nixon circled the part of the video below where I added the red circle, and he said: <span class="quote">"This is - this - you look at the way the levers are working in this - but, you know that - you've got triangles, you've got levers, you've got pinchers. […] It even falls up on itself, goes up to get the leverage. […] It creates some sort of a propulsion system, I mean, you look at the rotation on that."</span></p>

<p>Added later: In June 2025 a video vent viral where Suzanne Humphries said that she saw microchip-like structures in COVID vaccines under a microscope. She said that these were her photos, and that lifeoftheblood.com was her website: [<a href=https://x.com/DrSuzanneH7/status/1935106404257501500>https://x.com/DrSuzanneH7/status/1935106404257501500</a>]</p>

<p>At first I thought the images Matt Shelton showed to Maria Zeee were taken by Shelton himself, but he told Maria Zeee: <span class="quote">"But I, you know, I went and I met these scientists. I saw their work. I saw their microscope. You know, and I trusted absolutely that they found what they'd say."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vy0fic-dr.-shelton-and-sue-grey-evidence-of-nanotechnology-and-graphene-oxide-in-c.html?start=2012>https://rumble.com/vy0fic-dr.-shelton-and-sue-grey-evidence-of-nanotechnology-and-graphene-oxide-in-c.html?start=2012</a>] So I don't know if the images are supposed to have been taken by David Nixon, who is also from New Zealand like Shelton.</p>
<p>The images Humphries said were her images were featured in an article which seems to have originally published on a website called masksaredangerous.com on January 29th 2022 UTC, but it was only republished 5 days later on February 3rd 2022 UTC at lifeoftheblood.com, which Humphries said was her website.

</h3>
<p>In February 2025 Philip McMillan published an interview with Dr. Azzard Comrie from Jamaica, who claims he is seeing the clots in living people. [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking</a>]</p>
<p>At the start of the video McMillan said: <span class="quote">"So over the period of time we have been asking questions about has anyone else seen these clots, has anyone else stepped forward? And the fact that nobody has come forward seems to give the impression that this is not occurring, or if it is it's only random and not too significant."</span> (And that's in fact the impression you get, because there seem to be only a handful of people who claim to have seen the clots, and there's even fewer people who claim to have seen the clots in living people. Actually I can think of only 4 or 5 people who have personally testified that they have seen the clots in living people, but all except one of them have been interviewed by McMillan.)</p>
<p>And after that McMillan said that Azzard Comrie was his friend from high school: <span class="quote">"This <em>is</em> someone that I know - and therefore he has independently however reached out to me - so I have known him for many many years from my high school days, because we were at a similar school. And he's also a practicing doctor. But I haven't been in contact with him for a long time. And so him reaching out to me at this point is representative of the fact that he wants to raise awareness of this, not necessarily because of our direct connection."</span></p>
<p>But what are the odds that one of the few people who claims to have seen the clots in a living person happened to be a childhood friend of the same guy who was contacted by the anonymous cath lab whistleblower?</p>
<p>McMillan also wrote that Comrie observed unusual effects of vaccination, including a drastic drop in the level of vitamin D, an entire group of workers developing hypertension, and the heart increasing to nearly six times the previous size:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B12 and Vitamin D Deficiency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He tracked over 200 patients and found that <strong>nearly all of them had a drastic drop in Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D levels post-vaccination.</strong></li>
<li>Even individuals who worked outdoors for hours daily had abnormally low Vitamin D levels.</li>
<li>B12 levels dropped so drastically that he believes <strong>other critical micronutrient deficiencies</strong> may also be at play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rise in Thyroid Disorders and Hypertension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>spike in new-onset thyroid disease</strong> and high blood pressure cases, particularly in previously healthy individuals.</li>
<li>In one workplace, an <strong>entire group of employees developed hypertension post-vaccine.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drastic Cardiac Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One case stood out: a man with a <strong>normal heart size in 2020</strong> who returned months after vaccination with a <strong>heart that had enlarged to nearly six times its normal size.</strong></li>
<li>Despite aggressive treatment, he passed away - a case that deeply troubled Dr. Comrie.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said that in severe cases of cardiomegaly, the heart can enlarge up to 2 to 2.5 times its normal size, but that a sixfold increase would be incompatible with life.</p>

<p>In 2025 Wayne Crouch from Australian National Review published a series of documentary videos titled <span class="quote">"An Unholy Triad: The Birth of a Plague"</span>. The videos were narrated by an AI voice, they featured a lot of AI-generated imagery, and even the script sounded like it was generated by AI, so I don't know if the videos were made with some AI video generation software.</p>
<p>The credits of the videos mention Wayne Crouch, Lisa Johnston, Brenton Faithfull, Matt Shelton, Greg Harrison, Bruce Rapley, Daniel Santiago, Andrew Zywiec, Gerry Brady, Matt Shelton, Todd Callender, Richard Hirschman, John O'Looney, and Brenton Faithfull: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6paaoo-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-01.html?start=454>https://rumble.com/v6paaoo-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-01.html?start=454</a>]</p>

<p>Wayne Crouch is the <span class="quote">"head reporter"</span> at Australian National Review, which looks like an Aussie version of the Stew Peters Network. The front page of ANR's website even featured two interviews of Stew Peters: [<a href=https://anr.news>https://anr.news</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-anr.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>Wayne Crouch has a BitChute channel with only 15 subscribers. Many of his videos weren't even uploaded on any other site except ANR's own social media called Truthbook.Social. But somehow he still managed to book interviews with people like Robert Malone, David Icke, and Errol Musk: [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/channel/Bbk5AP5d>https://www.bitchute.com/channel/Bbk5AP5d</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-anr-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>The main theme of the Unholy Triad videos was how Crouch's research team had supposedly found new mysterious ORFs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The first episode of the series said: <span class="quote">"Direct evidence, lab records, internal PLA documents, and intercepted communications confirms China engineered three ORFs critical to SARS-CoV-2. ORF11: Documents from the early 2000s detail a gene enhancing viral entry into human cells, tested in bat coronaviruses at WIV to boost infectivity. ORF19: Research logs from 1999 to 2005 describe a sequence amplifying viral replication designed to accelerate spread uncovered in PLA virology studies. ORF29: Military reports from 2003 to 2008 outline a gene modulating host inflammatory responses intended to exacerbate disease severity trace to WIV experiments."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6paaoo-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-01.html?start=309>https://rumble.com/v6paaoo-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-01.html?start=309</a>] But none of the purported <span class="quote">"research logs"</span> or <span class="quote">"military reports"</span> were actually shown in the video series.</p>
<p>The fifth episode of An Unholy Triad said that ORF19 and ORF29 are responsible for the formation of clots: <span class="quote">"The ORFs are the masterminds, ranked by their deadly impact. The ORF19, fueled by phosphorus, locks fibrin and actin into indestructible amyloid-like clots, the backbone of this nightmare. Second, ORF29 with tin cements them rigid ensuring they resist all breakdown. Third, ORF8 twists immune evasion by blinding T-cells, letting clots thrive unchecked. Fourth, ORF3a ignites inflammation and tissue chaos, amplifying clot formation. Fifth, ORF11 blocks cellular cleanup prolonging the damage. And then in sixth place is ORF6: it cripples interference, weakening early defenses."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6qrijq-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-05.html?start=205>https://rumble.com/v6qrijq-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-episode-05.html?start=205</a>] Another episode of An Unholy Triad said: <span class="quote">"We've ranked the ORF: ORF6 is quiet sabotage, ORF11 is cleanup block, ORF3a is chaos, ORF8 stealth, ORF29 cement, ORF19 slaughter. A kill chain forged in the abyss."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6r40im-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-season-02-episode-01.html?start=130>https://rumble.com/v6r40im-an-unholy-triad-the-birth-of-a-plague-season-02-episode-01.html?start=130</a>]</p>
<p>The regular ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 only go up to ORF10, but I don't know if ORF19 and ORF29 are supposed to be nested ORFs inside the spike protein or something. Later parts of An Unholy Triad claimed that the same ORFs were included in both the vaccines and the virus, which seems to suggest that the mystery ORFs are nested ORFs within the spike protein, since the most common vaccine types in western countries only include the spike protein (even though Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines include the whole virus).</p>
<p>Wayne Crouch wrote that documents describing the mystery ORFs were deciphered by <span class="quote">"our chemist"</span>, which probaby refers to Greg Harrison who is a chemist, and who is a member of the Solution of Scientists group that also includes Wayne Crouch: [<a href=https://puremediaaustralia.org/f/global-conspiracy-exposed-unveiling-the-ultimate-bioweapon>https://puremediaaustralia.org/f/global-conspiracy-exposed-unveiling-the-ultimate-bioweapon</a>]</p>

<p>Our brilliant Chemist, part of a scientific research team we call <span class="quote">"A Solution Of Scientist's"</span>.</p>

<p>This weapon, disguised within the fabric of a global health crisis, leverages the genetic capabilities of viruses, particularly through the modification of viral Open Reading Frames (ORFs), to achieve its deadly purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Modified ORFs:</strong> Our Chemist's research has deciphered documents written in what we now understand to be bioweapon nomenclature, a language reserved for those with clearance in bioweapon programs.</p>

<p>As an example of the secret bioweaponeer code that was deciphered by Greg Harrison, here <span class="quote">"Hetnody Ane Uadeeanchounsylnfrtn"</span> is code for <span class="quote">"Cytokine-Anchored Systemic Inflammation"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1888539927929037124>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1888539927929037124</a>]</p>

<p>The hoax about ORF11 and ORF19 seems to have been inspired by a Twitter thread from 2023 by Patent_SUN, who wrote about analysis by the Japanese Twitter user mbi92710920. When mbi92710920 ran ORFfinder on the Pfizer plasmid sequence that was uploaded to GenBank by Kevin McKernan, the ORF for the spike protein was labeled ORF11, and the long ORF on the reverse strand that spans almost the entire length of the spike protein was labeled ORF19: [<a href=https://x.com/Patent_SUN/status/1699619448909713661>https://x.com/Patent_SUN/status/1699619448909713661</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-patentsun-1.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>Patent_SUN also posted this plasmid map for the ORFs (where there's just a single ORF19 on the reverse strand and not multiple different <span class="quote">"ORF-19 components"</span> like in Greg Harrison's AI hallucination):</p>

<p>The longest ORF on the reverse strand of McKernan's Pfizer sequence is 1252 amino acids long: [<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OR134577>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OR134577</a>]</p>

<p>The long reverse ORF exists only in the vaccine but not the virus, because the ORF is a byproduct of the codon optimization which coincidentally happened to remove the stop codons from the reverse strand. In the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome of SARS-CoV-2, the longest ORF on the reverse strand of the spike protein is only 82 amino acids long:</p>

<p>Patent_SUN's thread said that there are 23 prion motifs in ORF19, which meant that the reverse ORF has 23 matches to the motif <code>GXXXG</code>:</p>
<pre>$ r=$(seqkit seq -rp pfizerplasmid.fa|seqkit seq -s);for x in $r ${r:1} ${r:2};do sed &#39;s/.../&amp; /g&#39;&lt;&lt;&lt;$x|grep -Po &#39;ATG.*?(?=(TAA|TAG|TGA))&#39;|tr -d \ ;done|awk &#39;{print&quot;&gt;&quot;NR}1&#39;|seqkit translate|seqkit sort -lr|seqkit head -n1|seqkit locate -rPpG...G|sed 1d|wc -l

<p>So therefore Greg Harrison's crew claims that ORF19 is the <span class="quote">"most dangerous"</span> ORF because it has the highest number of matches to <code>GXXXG</code>: [<a href=https://x.com/CoyoteSanctuary/status/1904011361538957764>https://x.com/CoyoteSanctuary/status/1904011361538957764</a>]</p>

<p>But then is ORF1ab even more dangerous than ORF19? ORF1ab has 24 matches to the <code>GXXXG</code> motif, which is even higher than 23 matches in the reverse ORF in the Pfizer plasmid:</p>

<p>Greg Harrison posted the table below where he now has mystery ORFs going up to ORF100: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528/photo/2>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528/photo/2</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-orfcontent.png width=500>
</div>
<p>But the data in the table looks fake because the Q/N content and R/K content values are all divisible by 5. For example ORF85 is shown to have 15% Q/N content. But the length of ORF85 is 28 aa, and <code>4/28</code> is about 0.143 and <code>5/28</code> is about 0.179, so neither is 15% when rounded to the nearest integer. There is no integer you can divide by 28 that produces a percentage of 15% when rounded to the nearest integer.</p>
<p>Greg's table shows that ORF10 is 38 aa long, which matches the real length of ORF10 in Wuhan-Hu-1 if you don't count the stop codon. But Greg's fake ORF10 has 10% Q/N content and 20% R/K content, even though in the real ORF10 in Wuhan-Hu-1 there's 1 Q and 5 N so there's about 16% Q/N content, and there's 2 R and 0 K so there's about 5% R/K content:</p>

<p>Greg's table also shows that ORF29 is 60 aa long and it has 50% Q/N content. There's a total of 59,448 possible 60 aa segments of Wuhan-Hu-1 on all 3 frames of both strands. But the highest number of Q and N residues in any of the segments is 16, and <code>16/60</code> is only 27%:</p>

<p>Out of the 8 ORFs in Greg's table, ORF10 has the same length as the real ORF10 of Wuhan-Hu-1, but 5 out of the 7 imaginary ORFs have a length that is divisible by 5. If you pick 7 random integers in the range of 22 to 75 so that repetitions are allowed, the likelihood that 5 or more of the integers are divisible by 5 is about 0.5%: <code>v=22:75;sum(dbinom(5:7,7,sum(v%%5==0)/length(v)))</code>.</p>

And the ORF19 in the Pfizer vaccine was produced by codon optimization so it doesn't even exist in SARS-CoV-2.

To clarify: our research does not claim direct sequence homology between phage ORF19 and SARS-CoV-2. Rather, we use phage modular ORF clusters as an evolutionary analogy for how small hidden ORFs can persist and function biologically. The presence or absence of ORF19 in vaccine codon-optimized constructs is separate from its potential existence in wild-type SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our current research is focused on bioinformatics and mass spectrometry validation of cryptic ORFs in the wild-type virus, using evolutionary, structural, and functional evidence chains."</span> And I replied: <span class="quote">"The ORF19 in your phage is not a <span class="quote">'hidden ORF'</span>, but it's a regular ORF that codes for a functional gene, and that is not a nested ORF hidden inside some other ORF: <a href=https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CU468217.><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CU468217" class="uri">https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CU468217</a>.</a>"</span> I also wrote: <span class="quote">"The numbering of the ORFs depends on what utility you use to annotate the ORFs, what minimum length for ORFs you use, and whether you include alternative start codons. The region of the vaccine plasmid that happened to be annotated ORF19 by ORFfinder is not an ORF in SARS-CoV-2."</span> But Greg replied to me: <span class="quote">"To clarify: the ORFs analyzed are frame-specific translations from synthetic mRNA constructs related to vaccine plasmids, not from the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 viral genome itself. Direct comparisons to viral frames are therefore not applicable. In addition, Q/N enrichment is only one of several properties assessed for prionogenic potential, alongside motif patterning and disorder prediction."</span> But I pointed out to Greg that the text below his table of fake ORFs said that the ORFs were <span class="quote">"SARS-CoV-2 ORF peptides"</span>, and his ORF10 was 38 aa long like the real ORF10 of Wuhan-Hu-1. And I pointed out how even in the Pfizer spike plasmid sequence that McKernan uploaded to GenBank, the highest Q/N content out of any 60 aa segment is only 25%.</p>

<p>But to Hirschman's credit, at least he said that ORF11 was the spike ORF, and he showed a real plasmid map of the Pfizer vaccine and not one of Greg's AI-hallucinated plasmid maps. Greg later claimed that ORF11 was 35 aa long.

<a href=#Philip_McMillan_and_mystery_ORFs id=Philip_McMillan_and_mystery_ORFs>Philip McMillan and mystery ORFs</a>

<p>In February 2025 Philip McMillan posted a Substack post where he promoted the first part of the Unholy Triad series. He said that the authors of the video had access to 6,000 pages of secret documents that they were going to release as a dead man's switch in the event that any of the authors are silenced. McMillan claimed to have personally seen some of the secret documents which described ORF11 and ORF19: [<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/covid-secrets-theyre-hiding-from>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/covid-secrets-theyre-hiding-from</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was woken up at 4 a.m. this morning with information so shocking that it has left me reeling. Over the past few years, I have had the privilege of speaking with some of the world's leading scientists, those who refuse to stop investigating the depths of COVID-19's origins and impact. But today's revelation is different. It is worse than even I had imagined.</p>
<p>For those who have followed my work, you know that I have always been driven by one question: What if we were never told the whole story? Now, thanks to a group of relentless scientists, we have 6,000 pages of documents that lay bare the full pandemic timeline, from inception to global rollout. And what they reveal is more than just negligence or incompetence; it suggests a deliberate obfuscation of critical facts.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Within these documents, there is one section that immediately caught my attention—the reference to modified ORFs (Open Reading Frames) 10, 11, and 19 in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This seemingly minor genetic detail might hold the key to understanding the virus's impact on human biology, particularly its ability to drive unprecedented clotting mechanisms.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>What makes this discovery even more alarming is the response from authorities. The scientists behind this breakthrough are already facing pressure from powerful institutions. Some have been warned not to publish their findings. Others have been contacted by government officials who want access to the data before it goes public.</p>
<p>Even as I share this with you, precautions are being taken. The lead researchers have secured multiple copies of the documents, and in the event that any of them are silenced, the information will immediately be released worldwide. There is no stopping this truth now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March 2025 Philip McMillan livestreamed a video about the fake ORFs where he was reading from a document titled <code>Daniel_Santiago_ORF_relationships_Quantum_Codon_Energetics_12_3_25</code>. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVg_aoK2EaM>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVg_aoK2EaM</a>, <a href=https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1lPJqMDwNjdJb>https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1lPJqMDwNjdJb</a>] I didn't find the document published anywhere, but McMillan showed these pages of the document during the stream:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mcmillan-santiago-1.jpg width=900><img src=i/clot-mcmillan-santiago-2.jpg width=900><img src=i/clot-mcmillan-santiago-3.jpg width=900><img src=i/clot-mcmillan-santiago-4.jpg width=900><img src=i/clot-mcmillan-santiago-5.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>So Daniel Santiago's document now has mystery ORFs going up to ORF100. And for some reason the ORFs are organized in blocks of about 20 ORFs, where the ORFs within each block similar functions, even though normally ORFs are numbered based on their position in the genome and not so that ORFs with similar functions are given consecutive numbers.</p>
<p>The document McMillan showed was titled <code>Daniel_Santiago_ORF_relationships_Quantum_Codon_Energetics_12_3_25</code>. <span class="quote">"Quantum codon energetics"</span> refers to a nonsensical technobabble theory by Daniel Santiago, which sounds like something out of a paper by Jean-Claude Perez: [<a href=https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202503.0548>https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202503.0548</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-santiago-quantum-codon.png width=600>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Daniel Santiago is supposed to a member of the <span class="quote">"Solution of Scientists"</span> group, but he was featured in Maria Zeee's clot panel together with Hirschman, Greg Harrison, and Wayne Crouch, and he has also done other videos with Hirschman and Harrison, and he was credited as a member of the <span class="quote">"scientific research and advisory team"</span> of An Unholy Triad.</p>
<p>But anyway if McMillan was for real, he should've realized that the documents about the mystery ORFs were fake. And in fact even if he would've only watched the first part of the Unholy Triad series, he should've realized that the videos were disinformation. But instead he had little negative to say about the ORFs, and he published multiple videos and tweets and Substack posts where he promoted the story about the ORFs, so it makes him look like controlled opposition who is deliberately promoting false information.</p>
<p>Therefore it is very telling how it was McMillan out of all people who was contacted by the anonymous cath lab whistleblower, and how McMillan's childhood friend Azzard Comrie is one of the few people who claim to have seen the calamari clots in living people. In the same way that in 2022 new revelations about the clots were first presented by Jane Ruby, and various whistleblowers contacted Jane Ruby to provide her information about the clots, later on the same role seems to have been occupied by Philip McMillan.</p>
<p>McMillan did all of these videos about the clots between January 2024 and May 2025 alone:</p>

<p>When I tried searching Twitter for the Rumble URL of each episode of An Unholy Triad, I got a total of 36 results, out of which the most results were posted by Greg Harrison (13), a user called max_ev_84 (7), Wayne Crouch (5), and Greg's cheerleader CoyoteSanctuary (5):</p>

<p>My table above does not include the tweets by Kirsch or O'Looney, because Kirsch quoted Greg's tweets and O'Looney didn't post links to Rumble but to the website of Australian National Review. (Added later: After I compiled the table above, the embalmer Laura Jeffrey also posted links to multiple episodes of An Unholy Triad: <a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1916621461873115253.><a href="https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1916621461873115253" class="uri">https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1916621461873115253</a>.</a>)</p>
<p>A tweet that promoted An Unholy Triad was also posted by NZDSOS (The New Zealand Doctors Speaking Out with Science). NZDSOS wrote that the videos were based on <span class="quote">"thousands of encrypted pages"</span> of documents: [<a href=https://x.com/nzdsos/status/1894285548929650831>https://x.com/nzdsos/status/1894285548929650831</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the first release of a planned series of videos based on a new treasure trove of thousands of encrypted pages provided to a small group of doctors and scientists along with the owners of an online news site, Pure Media Australia.</p>
<p>Now successfully being decrypted, so far the information appears largely public domain already, but puts the focus back on the provenance of the so-called virus responsible for the illness labelled Covid-19.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The encrypted files contained bioweapons language, and document highly specific sequences, called open reading frames (ORFs), in SARS COV-2.</p>
<p>These ORFs are genetic code that make host cells produce proteins which, amongst other things, can cause severe inflammation and clotting, including the highly abnormal white clots that seem to be an amyloid process in the blood itself (amyloid usually affects specific <span class="quote">'solid'</span> organ systems).</p>

<p>Matt Shelton is the cofounder of NZDSOS, but he was also credited as one of the three executive producers of An Unholy Triad and as a member of its <span class="quote">"scientific research and advisory team"</span>. Shelton also posted tweet where he linked to the page for An Unholy Triad on the website of Pure Media Australia (but it was missing from my table above because I only included links to Rumble videos in the table).

<a href=#Greg_Harrisons_naval_intelligence_cheerleader_RexesRule id=Greg_Harrisons_naval_intelligence_cheerleader_RexesRule>Greg Harrison's naval intelligence cheerleader RexesRule</a>
</h3>
<p>In early 2025 when Greg Harrison and his co-conspirators were promoting the hoax about the fake ORFs, their biggest cheerleaders on Twitter were users called CoyoteSanctuary and RexesRule/CatsRule2023. Both of them also joined Kevin McCairn's Discord around December 2024 after McCairn had started doing videos with Hirschman and Harrison. Even after I had posted exhaustive evidence on the Discord that the ORFs were fake, RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary kept defending Greg's ORFs, and they just told me that I was crazy or that I was a counterintelligence agent. So I thought they might have been in on the scam, since otherwise their behavior of defending Greg's hoax did not seem reasonable.</p>
<p>When I looked into the Twitter profile of RexesRule, I noticed that her banner image had a seal that said <span class="quote">"NAVSECGRUDIV"</span> and <span class="quote">"NAVCAMSEASTPAC"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/CatsRule2023>https://x.com/CatsRule2023</a>]</p>

<p>Wikipedia says: [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Security_Group>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Security_Group</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Naval Security Group (NAVSECGRU) was an organization within the United States Navy, tasked with intelligence gathering and denial of intelligence to adversaries. A large part of this is signals intelligence gathering, cryptology and information assurance. The NAVSECGRU organization was active from March 1935 to September 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to being part of the Navy, NAVSECGRU was also part of the National Security Agency's Central Security Service.</p>
<p>The NAVSECGRU organization was transferred to the Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) where its former assets made up the Information Operations Directorate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"NAVCAMS EASTPAC"</span> is short for <span class="quote">"Naval Communication Area Master Station, Eastern Pacific"</span>. [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Computer_and_Telecommunications_Area_Master_Station_Pacific>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Computer_and_Telecommunications_Area_Master_Station_Pacific</a>]</p>
<p>I found a thread where RexesRule wrote: <span class="quote">"My NAVSECGRU team was the best."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166>https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166</a>, <a href=https://archive.is/tZhov>https://archive.is/tZhov</a>] Then someone asked <span class="quote">"SEAL?"</span> And she replied that she was a spook: <span class="quote">"Sorry, no. Spook here. Love the Seals, though. How about you?"</span> [<a href=https://archive.is/2gCXL>https://archive.is/2gCXL</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-rexesrule-spook.png width=500>
</div>
<p>An announcement from 2005 said: <span class="quote">"What was formerly NAVSECGRU has now become NETWARCOM's Information Operations Directorate."</span> [<a href=https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html>https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html</a>] The announcement also said: <span class="quote">"The IO warfare area is composed of five core integrated capabilities: Electronic Warfare, Computer Network Operations, Psychological Operations, Military Deception and Operational Security."</span> So I asked RexesRule if she worked for the deception capability or psyop capability of NAVSECGRU, but she didn't answer me.</p>
<p>Later after I got Kevin McCairn to denounce Greg's ORF hoax, Greg Harrison posted a tweet where he wrote <span class="quote">"And at this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span class="quote">'rantings'</span> due to our lack of credible evidence that any of our ORF stuff actually exists."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892</a>] After that RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary also seem to have conceded that the ORFs were fake. However that doesn't mean that they couldn't have been complicit in Greg's operation, because it wouldn't have made sense for them to keep supporting Greg's ORF hoax after Greg himself had retracted it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand it's possible that RexesRule is just a useful idiot, because the oldest tweet that matched the query <code>@RexesRule @Greg21143362</code> was only posted in February 2025, which decreases the likelihood that she would be part of a team that produces disinformation together with Greg Harrison. And similarly the oldest tweet that matched <code>@CoyoteSanctuary @Greg21143362</code> was only posted in December 2024. But both RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary had earlier frequently interacted with Kevin McCairn.</p>
<p>RexesRule has also made many meme-style images where she promotes the memetic warfare specialist Kevin McCairn, and she frequently posts tweets where she asks people to donate money to McCairn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an ode to henji….;</p>
<p>Aiming to systematically deconstruct this mischaracterization and affirm the evidentiary integrity behind each of the conclusions presented in our research - so far and is continuing….</p>
<h3 id="orf-identification-and-sequence-integrity">1. ORF Identification and Sequence Integrity</h3>
<p>The ORFs in question (ORF11, ORF19, ORF29) are not AI inventions. These sequences have been documented in extended SARS-CoV-2 annotations, including in studies by Jungreis et al. (2021, eLife) and Cagliani et al. (2020, Journal of Virology).</p>
<p>ORF19 in particular has clear homology to adenoviral lipase-encoding regions and shows conservation across various coronavirus genomes. ORF11 and ORF29 exhibit non-canonical initiation codons and overlapping reading frames, a hallmark of viral genomic economy.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-corroboration-of-amyloid-prion-pathology">2. Experimental Corroboration of Amyloid-Prion Pathology</h3>
<p>Our research into embalmer-extracted white clots has used a multi-modal analytical approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>HPLC proteomics identified disproportionate presence of fibrinogen beta chains, actin, and immunoglobulin fragments.</li>
<li>ICP-MS/OES revealed consistently elevated phosphorus, tin, and sulfur, aligning with phospholipid nanoparticle exposure.</li>
<li>Congo Red fluorescence microscopy and Thioflavin T binding assays confirmed amyloid characteristics.</li>
<li>NMR spectra and RT-QuIC prion-seeding assays demonstrated structural misfolding.</li>
</ul>
<p>These confirm that the white clots represent amyloid-prion fibrinaloid masses that are resistant to fibrinolysis and persist under normal pharmacological conditions.</p>
<h3 id="functional-significance-of-orfs-in-viral-evolution-and-pathogenesis">3. Functional Significance of ORFs in Viral Evolution and Pathogenesis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The deletion of ORF19 and ORF27 in hypervirulent fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) (e.g., HLJFAd15, JSJ13, HB1510) was shown to correlate with increased viral replication and virulence (Zhao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016).</li>
<li>This is not a mere association but a reproducible experimental outcome.</li>
<li>Recombinant deletion studies (see Wang et al., 2020) further confirmed that ORF19 is non-essential for replication but constrains viral speed and virulence.</li>
<li>Applying this understanding to SARS-CoV-2, the presence of prionogenic sequences in hidden ORFs may serve as latent toxicity reservoirs, only becoming pathological upon post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation via DSPC nanoparticle exposure).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ai-integration-synthesis-not-hallucination">4. AI Integration: Synthesis, Not Hallucination</h3>
<p>The AI tool employed has not fabricated novel biology. Rather, it integrates cross-disciplinary inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sequence alignment and motif detection (e.g., X-motif enrichment, prion-like domains)</li>
<li>Post-translational modification predictions</li>
<li>Known envenomation mimetics (e.g., PLA2, metalloproteinase-like domains)</li>
<li>Structural homologies with neurotoxins</li>
</ul>
<p>Such integrations are reproducible, testable, and transparent. Dismissing them as hallucinations without interrogating the input datasets or model logic reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how advanced AI assists bioscience.</p>
<h3 id="implications-for-pathogenic-amyloidogenesis">5. Implications for Pathogenic Amyloidogenesis</h3>
<p>We now understand that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains multiple layers of coding capacity, including hidden ORFs that may encode disordered, prion-like peptides. When coupled with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustained antigenic presence (e.g., spike persistence post-mRNA vaccination)</li>
<li>Lipid nanoparticle-induced aberrant phosphorylation</li>
<li>Host immune suppression via ORF3b, ORF6, ORF8, and others</li>
</ul>
<p>…we observe a convergent mechanism capable of initiating systemic amyloid-prion fibrinogenesis.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, the findings presented are not the product of speculative AI. They reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid genomic annotations</li>
<li>Laboratory-confirmed pathologies</li>
<li>Mechanistically plausible pathways</li>
<li>Precedent in viral evolutionary studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Labeling this body of work as <span class="quote">"AI hallucination"</span> is not only inaccurate but risks undermining emerging models of cross-disciplinary biosynthetic integration.</p>
<p>We encourage the scientific community to evaluate these findings on their experimental merit and falsifiability, not on outdated notions of computational inference.</p>

<p>Greg's AI told me: <span class="quote">"The ORFs in question (ORF11, ORF19, ORF29) are not AI inventions. These sequences have been documented in extended SARS-CoV-2 annotations, including in studies by Jungreis et al. (2021, eLife) and Cagliani et al. (2020, Journal of Virology)."</span> I told Greg that I didn't see any reference to ORFs 11, 19, or 29 in the papers by Jungreis or Cagliani, in case he meant these papers: <a href=https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00411-20>https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00411-20</a>, <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682221000532.><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682221000532" class="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682221000532</a>.</a> So Greg's AI seems to have hallucinated citations about the ORFs while it simultaneously said that the ORFs are not AI inventions.</p>
<p>Greg's AI told me: <span class="quote">"ICP-MS/OES revealed consistently elevated phosphorus, tin, and sulfur, aligning with phospholipid nanoparticle exposure."</span> But McCairn said that he didn't find a high level of tin or phosphorus in the clots with EDX.</p>
<p>Greg's AI told me: <span class="quote">"ORF19 in particular has clear homology to adenoviral lipase-encoding regions."</span> I asked Greg: <span class="quote">"But what range of nucleotides in Wuhan-Hu-1 is ORF19? And what part of that range has homology to what range of nucleotides in what adenovirus accession?"</span> But he didn't answer me, and he just said I was a troll. I have never seen Greg give a nucleotide range of any of his ORFs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and I haven't seen him post a nucleotide or amino acid sequence of any of his ORFs.</p>
<p>Open reading frames are numbered based on their position in the genome and not based on their function. Greg's AI made it seem like an ORF19 in some random adenovirus would have something to do with an ORF19 in SARS-CoV-2, but it's similar to saying that if one street has a restaurant at street number 19, you can predict that buildings with the number 19 on other streets are also restaurants.</p>
<p>Greg's AI told me: <span class="quote">"The AI tool employed has not fabricated novel biology."</span> But in the same response the AI literally had the chutzpah to fabricate novel biology out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>In September 2024 Laura Kasner posted a PDF document about the clots titled <span class="quote">"A New Iatrogenic Disease? a detailed compositional and histopathological analysis of white clots"</span>. The cover of the PDF said <span class="quote">"Authors remain anonymous for safety reasons"</span> even though Kasner wrote that Greg Harrison was one of the authors: [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed</a>]</p>
<div>

<p>A version of the PDF with OCR was posted here: <a href=https://5nn.info/temp/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024--OCRed/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024-OCRed.pdf.><a href="https://5nn.info/temp/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024--OCRed/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024-OCRed.pdf" class="uri">https://5nn.info/temp/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024--OCRed/Sos_Press_Release_August_2024-OCRed.pdf</a>.</a></p>
<p>The document was described as a press release, but it had a big red <span class="quote">"TOP SECRET"</span> stamp on the cover page. A <span class="quote">"top secret press release"</span> sounds like an oxymoron.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Elemental_analysis_with_ICP_MS id=Elemental_analysis_with_ICP_MS>Elemental analysis with ICP-MS</a>
</h3>
<p>In the PDF for the top secret press release by SOS, there was this plot which showed the amount of zinc that was supposedly present in 8 different calamari clot samples:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-variance-1.png width=500>
</div>
<p>And on the next page there was this plot that showed that there was 100% or close to 100% variance in the amount of zinc in the samples (even though the ppm values for zinc didn't seem to be anywhere close to maximally variable):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-variance-2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>When I measured the pixels to approximate the ppm values of zinc in each sample, and I multiplied the variance of the ppm values by 100, the result was about 62%:</p>
<pre>&gt; v=c(102,71,33,55,58,33,46,36)/150*5
&gt; var(v)*100
[1] 61.57937</pre>
<p>But actually I don't even know how you're supposed to calculate a variance percent that is constrained to the range 0-100%, because my code above can produce percentages that exceed 100%, and SOS seems to have used some other method to calculate the variance percentages. When I asked ChatGPT how to calculate a variance percent, it suggested this formula:</p>
<pre>&gt; sqrt(var(v))/mean(v)*100
[1] 43.395</pre>
<p>But that formula can sometimes also produce values above 100%. When I asked ChatGPT how to constrain the values to the range of 0-100%, it suggested the formula: <code>sqrt(var(v))/mean(v)*100</code>. But that also produced a value above 100% for some inputs. Next ChatGPT suggested this formula: <code>var(v)/(max(v)-min(v))^2*100</code>. But that doesn't seem to be any standard way to calculate a variance percentage either. And in any case the ppm values for zinc presented by SOS don't seem to be maximally variable (whatever that would mean).</p>
<p>I asked Greg Harrison multiple times how the variance percentages were calculated, but he never answered me. So I suspect his ICP-MS data may have been fake like his data about the ORFs.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Peptide_mapping_analysis_with_HPLC_MS id=Peptide_mapping_analysis_with_HPLC_MS>Peptide mapping analysis with HPLC-MS</a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to performing ICP-MS to analyze the elemental composition of the clots, SOS are supposed to have also performed HPLC-MS to analyze the protein composition of the clots. The top secret press release included three pie charts like this which showed the 21 most abundant proteins in the clot samples: [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ms-pie-3.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The charts only include fibrinogen but not fibrin among the 21 major constitutents. The anonymous authors at SOS wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authors suspect that Hirschman clots are composed primarily of fibrinogen that has not been converted to fibrin by the action of thrombin.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of Hirschman clots is the relative lack of fibrin and the apparent lack of thrombin to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. It is currently unknown whether thrombin is absent, present but somehow disabled, or otherwise inhibited.</p>
<p>In the hypothetical case of synthetic (iatrogenic) clot causation as a result of COVID vaccines, the Spike Protein (produced by the host cells) and the lipid nanoparticles may act as the initiators of the clotting cascade. In the absence of functional thrombin, the clotting cascade may instead utilise partially disassociated fibronectin rather than fibrin, resulting in a long, rubbery clot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However when I showed one of the pie charts to ChatGPT and asked it the chart should also include fibrin, ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mass spectrometry data from your blood clot sample shows high levels of fibrinogen chains - beta, gamma, and alpha - which strongly suggests the presence of fibrin. In a clot, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin, which cleaves off fibrinopeptides A and B. However, standard bottom-up proteomics workflows break down proteins into peptides for identification. As a result, the peptides detected from fibrin often look the same as those from fibrinogen unless the analysis specifically targets unique features of fibrin, like crosslinked peptides or missing fibrinopeptides.</p>
<p>What you're seeing in the pie chart is a reflection of this peptide overlap. The data likely includes fibrin, but it's labeled based on its precursor proteins - fibrinogen chains - because most mass spec pipelines don't distinguish between the cleaved (fibrin) and uncleaved (fibrinogen) forms without additional targeted methods. The presence of Factor XIIIa in your data supports the idea that fibrin is present and has undergone crosslinking, which is a key step in stabilizing the fibrin mesh.</p>
<p>To directly confirm fibrin rather than just fibrinogen, you would need to identify specific crosslinked peptides, like γ-γ or α-α chain dimers, or the absence of fibrinopeptides A and B. These are challenging to detect without specialized workflows, but they would definitively indicate fibrin formation. In summary, while the chart labels these proteins as fibrinogen chains, the biological context and presence of clot-related factors make it very likely that you're analyzing fibrin, just not labeled as such by default in the proteomics output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when the anonymous authors at SOS wrote that <span class="quote">"Hirschman clots are composed primarily of fibrinogen that has not been converted to fibrin"</span>, the authors may have been confused by how the mass spec results only included fibrinogen but not fibrin.</p>
<p>Similarly in a study where the authors used quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to analyze the protein composition of fibrin clots, fibrin was not listed as a major component of the clots, but only fibrinogen and fibronectin: <span class="quote">"Among 494 clot-bound proteins identified in all clots, the highest concentrations were for fibrinogen chains (about 64% of the clot mass) and fibronectin (13%). α2-antiplasmin (2.7%), factor XIIIA (1.2%), complement component C3 (1.2%), and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG, 0.61%) were present at relatively high concentrations. Proteins present in concentrations &lt;0.5% included (pro)thrombin, plasminogen, apolipoproteins, or platelet factor 4 (PF4)."</span> [<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874391919302593>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874391919302593</a>]</p>
<p>I have busted SOS presenting AI-generated data as real, so I'm not sure if their HPLC-MS data was also AI-generated. I told ChatGPT: <span class="quote">"generate fake mass spec proteomics results of a fibrin blood clot sample which shows percentage of each protein"</span>. It produced this table which looks somewhat similar to the results by SOS, and it's also missing fibrin but it only includes fibrinogen and fibronectin:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ms-chatgpt.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Next I asked Grok if these HPLC-MS results of blood clots looked fake or AI-generated:</p>
<div class="width00">
<img src=i/clot-ms-pie-1.png height=350><img src=i/clot-ms-pie-2.png height=350><img src=i/clot-ms-pie-3.png height=350>
</div>
<p>Grok brought up these points:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="quote">"Hemoglobin subunit beta and alpha are shown as major constituents (often the largest slices in the pie charts, e.g., ~30-40% in each sample). While hemoglobin can be present in blood clots due to trapped red blood cells, its dominance at this level is unusual for a fibrin-based clot. Fibrin (derived from fibrinogen) should be the most abundant protein in a blood clot, typically comprising 50-70% of the protein content. Hemoglobin at such high levels suggests either contamination or an unrealistic representation of clot composition."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Proteins like fibrinogen (alpha, beta, gamma chains) are present, which is expected, but other key clot-related proteins like plasminogen, von Willebrand factor, or coagulation factor XIII are either missing or underrepresented. For example, coagulation factor XIII is listed but in very small amounts, despite its critical role in cross-linking fibrin to stabilize the clot. Real MS data for blood clots would likely show these proteins in more significant proportions."</span> (But McCairn commented: <span class="quote">"This is because the mechanism of action is not cannonical physiological clot formation, it's an amyloidogenic cascade which will run independent of normally associated co-factors."</span>)</li>
<li><span class="quote">"Proteins like <span class="quote">'myeloperoxidase'</span> and <span class="quote">'cathepsin G'</span> (typically associated with neutrophils) are present in significant amounts. While these can be found in blood clots due to immune cell involvement, their proportions here seem exaggerated compared to what you'd expect in a typical clot, where structural proteins (fibrin) and plasma proteins (albumin, fibronectin) should dominate."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'Actin, cytoplasmic 1'</span> and <span class="quote">'histone H3-7'</span> are listed, but their presence in a blood clot at these levels is questionable. Histones might appear in trace amounts due to cell lysis, but not as a top 21 constituent. This suggests an AI might have included proteins commonly found in proteomic databases without considering their relevance to the sample type."</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However I'm not yet sure if the data is AI-generated or not.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn asked Greg Harrison to publish his raw files of the mass spectroscopy data, but Greg said something to the effect that he was not able to provide the files because it may have risked identifying the instrument or analyst who performed the analysis, and he himself only had access to summary data similar to the pie charts. (But if the analyst did not want to provide the raw files, couldn't Greg have just asked the analyst to share more detailed data as a CSV file or something?)</p>
<p>On Kevin McCairn's Discord there's a user called Centropede who is familiar with mass spectroscopy, who thinks Greg's mass spectroscopy data might be fake:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-centropede.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Greg Harrison tweeted: <span class="quote">"Janie, just a cautionary note pls - my work simply cannot be validated due to confidentiality required by the Institutions who did the work at our expense - they demanded we must never reveal the actual data provided as it will out them. Therefore none of our work can be substantiated as we are no longer involved in the early Solution of Scientists stuff etc - just saying"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915897815123038680>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915897815123038680</a>] And in the same thread he wrote: <span class="quote">"My PhD students who performed the actual analyses have yet to complete their respective PhD's at their respective Universities - this will never be compromised"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915900656420057495>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915900656420057495</a>] He also wrote: <span class="quote">"That's correct…no point continuing when we cannot furnish actual data for fear of compromising younger bright students who had quiet support from over-seeing professor asking for permanent anonymity 🥺"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915948691447533703>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1915948691447533703</a>]</p>
<p>I showed Greg tables of real HPLC-MS data and told him: <span class="quote">"You don't even have to publish the raw files but you could just publish tables like this as Excel or CSV files. It wouldn't identify the people or institute that performed the analysis."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1916552977600467261>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1916552977600467261</a>] But he replied: <span class="quote">"No,No, No…this won't fly either - because I already sent multiple XL sheet copies &amp; these were not enough for verification without the original data 😂"</span>. And he continued: <span class="quote">"The problem is that the original data is stamped &amp; signed by the over-seeing professors who demand anonymity…no more &amp; no less, hence we done &amp; dusted.."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"By <span class="quote">'multiple Excel sheet copies'</span>, do you mean spreadsheets that just showed the percentage of each protein like your pie charts? Don't you have more detailed data available? It wouldn't compromise anyone's anonymity any more than your pie charts do."</span> Then he posted this image and said <span class="quote">"just a sample…counts…"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1916697488955748823>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1916697488955748823</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hplc-counts.png width=900>
</div>
<p>Then I asked Greg <span class="quote">"What are the column headers?"</span> But he said: <span class="quote">"Proprietary…😂"</span> And I asked: <span class="quote">"Is the third or fourth column supposed to show the count in the second column as a percentage of the total count?"</span> But he didn't answer.</p>
<p>But the 5th column looks like a cumulative sum of the 4th column. When I took the table on the left and I tried reverse engineering the total count by dividing the counts in the 2nd column by the percentages in either the 3rd or 4th column, the 3rd column gave me a lower mean absolute deviation, which suggests that the 3rd column might show some kind of raw percentages of the counts but the 4th column might show adjusted percentages of the counts. But on the other hand if the data is fake, then all columns of the table might have plausibly been generated based on a list that just showed the name and percentage of each protein. And it doesn't inspire much confidence in Greg's data that he cannot even reveal what the columns in his table mean.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added later: When I later asked Greg to post the column headers again, this was his response: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1919716879226073391>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1919716879226073391</a>]</p>
<p><img src=i/clot-columnheader.png width=550></p>
<hr />
<p>Another addendum: During an interview with Nicolas Hulscher in May 2025, Greg said: <span class="quote">"The analysis results were conducted again by two different separate labs. And unfortunately - this is where I've been roundly critizized by public media - but I cannot furnish the actual data and the findings. Because one of them for example is written in a foreign language, which had to be translated. And the second, one of course - there are markers in there that will identify the universities. Now, this has been done in two universities, and the two universities have both stipulated - because one of my colleagues is actually studying a PhD in protein chemistry at one of these universities - that the can have access to this equipment. So, he was able to run all these tests. And we even had him - Richard was saying that - sign a certificate stamped by the university, hand-signed by the overseeing professor, that <span class="quote">'I am forbidden to show and demonstrate this original data. All I can do is present the findings, in spreadsheet, and all the interpretations that we've got.'</span> But when a scientist asks, <span class="quote">'I want to see your actual data.'</span> I have to politely refuse, and say, <span class="quote">'I cannot do this.'</span> One, because the university said they don't want their names mentioned, because of the nature of this work. Secondly, because I were working on human-type tissue - if you like - even though they were discarded. They are very nervous about this kind of work."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1920255597993189611>https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1920255597993189611</a>, time 23:39] So I asked Greg if the person at the other lab also signed an agreement, or why couldn't they share the data either? And I said he wouldn't even have to share the raw data but just a detailed spreadsheet of the results, which wouldn't identify either the person or the university. But Greg didn't answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added on May 11th 2025 UTC: I asked Greg: <span class="quote">"If the student who supposedly did your HPLC-MS analysis was doing a PhD degree in protein chemistry, didn't they tell you that fibrin doesn't normally show up in HPLC results but only fibrinogen?"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1921660804463517817>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1921660804463517817</a>] But he didn't answer and he blocked me.</p>

<a href=#Interview_of_Greg_Harrison_and_Tom_Haviland_by_Flashlights_in_April_2025 id=Interview_of_Greg_Harrison_and_Tom_Haviland_by_Flashlights_in_April_2025>Interview of Greg Harrison and Tom Haviland by Flashlights in April 2025</a>
</h3>
<p>On April 7th 2025 UTC a channel called Flashlights published an interview of Greg Harrison and Tom Haviland. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6rq775-do-mrna-covid-shots-cause-the-misfolding-of-proteins-in-humans-greg-harriso.html>https://rumble.com/v6rq775-do-mrna-covid-shots-cause-the-misfolding-of-proteins-in-humans-greg-harriso.html</a>]</p>
<p>I don't know if the interview was recorded earlier, because Greg was still talking about his ORF hoax in the interview, even though on April 4th UTC he tweeted that <span class="quote">"And at this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span class="quote">'rantings'</span> due to our lack of credible evidence that any of our ORF stuff actually exists."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892</a>]</p>
<p>Tom Haviland also seemed to support the story about the ORFs, and he said: <span class="quote">"But in the open literature you'll only see papers that like identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus from ORFs 1 through 10. And then it stops there as if that's the entire length of the code, that's all. What Greg is saying there seems to be evidence that there's more ORFs - more open reading frames - than what has been published in these published papers."</span> [1:09:06]</p>
<p>Earlier I wasn't sure if the mystery ORFs are supposed to be ORFs of the virus or vaccine or both. But now Tom Haviland said this about the ORFs: <span class="quote">"What are the chances that if they're in the virus that they may be in the COVID mRNA vaccine?"</span> [1:13:02] And Greg Harrison answered: <span class="quote">"We know that ORF11 and ORF19 are highly transcribed into the mRNA vaccination spike."</span> So I guess it means that ORF11 and ORF19 are supposed to be ORFs of the spike protein that are included in both the virus and the vaccine (even though the mRNA vaccines don't even have the same ORFs as the virus because of the codon optimization).</p>
<p>During the video Greg also said: <span class="quote">"So, the HPLC analysis we did, though the gentleman by the name of Dr. Arne Burkhard who had also done the same work on Richard's white clots by I think two years before us. And he used a technique called MALDI-TOF. And MALDI-TOF is an older technique - it's not quite as definitive as the technique we used, which is HPLC - and Dr. Burkhardt got over 300 different proteins in those white clots. He also noted - he did some other histology tests on it with Congo red - and he found - and he determined there was amyloid presence in his samples. Now, unfortunately, Dr. Burkhardt had met an untimely death. His work has been suppressed. We haven't been able to get a copy of his analysis, because I'd like to compare it with the analysis we have."</span> [15:06]</p>
<p>Then the host asked: <span class="quote">"You said that you tried to get a copy of his analysis and you couldn't. How is that possible? I mean, it wasn't it that was at a published paper, or why couldn't you get a copy of the paper?"</span> And Greg answered: <span class="quote">"Yeah, Arne Burkhardt had the same problem. We've got the people who supposedly conduct his MALDI-TOF work did not want their identities released. And, we'd have - Dr. Ryan Cole, I think, has had some success trying to locate some of these people to confirm his results. But end of the day, the results were not - exactly the same reason I've got, where the professors who have done the work using their MALDI-TOF equipment don't want their names out, because they're frightened of the blowback that may occur to the universities."</span></p>
<p>But his explanation doesn't make sense, because couldn't Burkhardt have just published the results of the analysis without having to publish the names of the researchers who did the analysis?</p>
<p>Actually one suspicious thing about Burkhardt is that he didn't publish his results in a proper scientific format, but he presented his results in conspiracy videos that were aimed at a mass audience. I think the closest to a scientific paper he wrote was a short report he wrote together with Sucharit Bhakdi about a video he did with Bhakdi. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-covax.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-covax.pdf</a>] In the press conference that Burkhardt organized in the office of his private practice, people were saying that vaccines contained graphene oxide, minirobots, and parasites, and that the blood of a vaccinated person contained a synthetic fiber that may have been a Morgellons fiber. [<a href=turbo.html#German_pathology_conference_held_by_Arne_Burkhardt>turbo.html#German_pathology_conference_held_by_Arne_Burkhardt</a>] But if Burkhardt is supposed to have analyzed the calamari clots in a lab, it's a further reason to be suspicious of him.</p>
<p>In the same video Haviland also said: <span class="quote">"And the next step that he's talking about is very important because we want to see whether, uh, we could take some of the ground-up sample of the white fibrous clot, and then, uh, put that into solution, inject it into animals - test animals such as hamsters, rhesus monkeys - and see if there's this prion activity, right. If that animal develops a white fibrous clot. In other words, is the white fibrous clot material contagious, infectious? Is it seeding? Does it, then, you know, does it plant itself in this vascular system and then grow and form a white fibrous clot to kill the animal? And we want to see if that happens, and if it does happen, how quickly does it happen. Because then that - you know, if, and if it does, that's, you know, even more alarming, right? Because it proves the presence of prion material in these white fibrous clots."</span> [1:30:55]</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn told me: <span class="quote">"You seem incapable of understanding that I am working independently and the only link is that is that Greg claims to have done some investigation on the clots. What he has done has nothing to do with my lab analysis."</span> [<a href=https://discord.com/channels/872999209182322719/1064054153183236146/1358510136867684532>https://discord.com/channels/872999209182322719/1064054153183236146/1358510136867684532</a>] So I asked McCairn why Tom Haviland said that McCairn's hamster experiment was an experiment done by <span class="quote">"we"</span>? But McCairn told me: <span class="quote">"Because he's talking out of his ass, I do not have any formal relationship with them beyond receiving the clot samples and discussing what I would be doing with the samples for analysis. If they start paying me for the work, I will let you know."</span> (However I suspect McCairn wanted to distance himself from Harrison and Haviland after I busted their ORF hoax.)</p>
<p>Another interesting thing Greg said in the interview with Flashlights was: <span class="quote">"I've also been in contact with New Zealand embalmers and also John O'Looney in the UK. And so we've got - and also one Laura Jeffrey from Canada - so we've got four embalmer, four different countries, all confirming they're seeing these white clots."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6rq775-do-mrna-covid-shots-cause-the-misfolding-of-proteins-in-humans-greg-harriso.html?start=266>https://rumble.com/v6rq775-do-mrna-covid-shots-cause-the-misfolding-of-proteins-in-humans-greg-harriso.html?start=266</a>] And a bit later he said: <span class="quote">"The hard analyses that we've done on Richard Hirschman's clots, and also on some clots out in New Zealand, down through Brenton Faithfull, ok - so we're matching up New Zealand clots, US clots - and I was hoping to get some samples from John O'Looney in UK, and also some samples out of Canada, from Laura, they've yet to arrive."</span> [11:10]</p>
<p>So Greg is supposed to be getting clots from 4 embalmers, but 3 of them were featured in a Stew Peters movie. And the 4th one is Laura Jeffrey, who has appeared in videos by VSRF, and she helped Haviland with running at least one of his surveys, and she claimed that the white clots resembled parasites and they seemed to be feeding off the currant jelly clots. [<a href=https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf>https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf</a>] All 4 embalmers have done videos in alt media where they have made ludicrous claims. Brenton Faithfull also said that after he first started keeping records in August 2021, 39 out of the first 40 dead people who passed through his funeral home had been vaccinated less than 2 weeks before their death. And John O'Looney claims that vaccines contain nanobots that are activated by 5G. And Hirschman said that Ana Maria Mihalcea's microscope photos of quantum dots were <span class="quote">"pretty daggum solid proof"</span>.</p>

<p>Tom Haviland wrote that Greg Harrison was the <span class="quote">"lead scientist"</span> of a team that was analyzing Hirschman's clots in a lab. [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the</a>] But Harrison seems to have been the main architect behind the hoax about the fake ORFs, which was clearly a form of deliberate disinformation, so Hirschman's association with Harrison makes it seem more likely that Hirschman is also controlled opposition.</p>

<p>During an interview with Nicolas Hulscher, Greg Harrison showed this AI-generated plot that was meant to represent Kevin McCairn's Raman spectroscopy analysis of calamari clots, and he said: <span class="quote">"That's the overlay - again this is an AI overlay of the actual graph"</span>: [<a href=https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/microscopic-and-biochemical-analysis>https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/microscopic-and-biochemical-analysis</a>]</p>

<p>Hulscher also included the plot in his Substack post and tweet about the interview, but he didn't indicate that it was AI-generated.</p>
<p>McCairn said on Discord that Greg <span class="quote">"has in fact got the raw data wrong that I have generated"</span>.</p>
<p>Hulscher's tweet also included a table of Greg Harrison's HPLC mass spectrometry results, but McCairn replied that the results should be ignored since Harrison is unable to publish the raw files of his HPLC analysis: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1920577333070868966>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1920577333070868966</a>]</p>

<p>In Greg's plot the peaks all have a uniform shape and the baseline level outside of the peaks is constant. But raw Raman spectroscopy data looks more noisy and the level outside the peaks is more variable (even though there's also plots that look more like Greg's plot because they show smoothed curves that were fitted against the raw data, like the bottom left plot below): [<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=raman+spectroscopy+plot&tbm=isch>https://www.google.com/search?q=raman+spectroscopy+plot&amp;tbm=isch</a>]</p>

<p>In May 2025 Greg Harrison posted this reply to a tweet by Doug Kell: <span class="quote">"Its such a pity that ethics protocol's prevent our embalmers actually sending you samples of embalmer white clots freshly extracted and preserved both under Argon &amp; in formalin, for amyloid presence confirmations…a missed opportunity if ever there is one…:cry:"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1920431081104248925>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1920431081104248925</a>]</p>
<p>I posted the tweet on McCairn's Discord. And I asked why didn't ethics protocols prevent the embalmers from sending clots to other people? Do the ethics protocols only come into play when someone who might not be in on the hoax asks to analyze the clots?</p>
<p>But McCairn posted this reply to me, which does make sense to some extent: <span class="quote">"It's an institutional requirement that there be informed consent for any data to be published. In this case there is no informed consent, it's taking waste that would otherwise go down the drain. As a private lab I don't have to be bound by the same requirements as a University or hospital as I'm just conducting analysis with no identification as to the individual, and I will not publish it in a journal, until informed consent is obtained."</span></p>

<p>In March 2025 McCairn livestreamed an experiment on his Discord where he took ground up pieces of a calamari clot and injected them into the heart of a hamster.</p>
<p>Wayne Crouch posted an infographic about how McCairn killed a hamster after injecting it with <span class="quote">"our amyloid jab clot samples"</span>. The graphic said that Kevin McCairn was linked to <span class="quote">"Solution of Scientists"</span>, which is the group that Wayne Crouch and Greg Harrison are part of. Crouch is supposed to be a journalist, but in his infographic he somehow managed to misspell the words <span class="quote">"scientist's"</span>, <span class="quote">"hampsters"</span>, and <span class="quote">"acess"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1904696389176803605>https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1904696389176803605</a>]</p>

<p>Wayne Crouch published the same image on Facebook with the following text: [<a href=https://www.facebook.com/PureMediaAustralia/posts/pfbid02eEx7h76h64g7Bj1EkBzDkxHGnJ5VrXAubJsnM6eojjGenytdbVhCn6ySdNLWanLHl>https://www.facebook.com/PureMediaAustralia/posts/pfbid02eEx7h76h64g7Bj1EkBzDkxHGnJ5VrXAubJsnM6eojjGenytdbVhCn6ySdNLWanLHl</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So good news is we were able to have one of our clots cryogenicly frozen ground to dust and injected into lab hamsters to test how long it took for these amyloid filled prion laden monsters to cause death.</p>
<p>We were expecting in six months to get the data …. we got the data early ….</p>
<p>Now the bad news is we got it early because the hamsters all died straight away meaning we are in big big trouble this is as bad as it gets.</p>
<p>Had they died in weeks or months maybe we had a few years longer the rapid death of our test subjects means we will see the rapid death to the shot recipients boosters will greatly accelerate this.</p>
<p>Now we perform dose range finding we do that by halving dose to give us a baseline estimate on how long it takes for full blown disease to take hold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how Crouch spoke of McCairn's experiment as an experiment that was performed by <span class="quote">"we"</span>. Crouch wrote that <span class="quote">"the hamsters all died"</span>, even though I think there was just a single hamster that died. And anyway McCairn's experiment was awful evidence that <span class="quote">"we will see the rapid death to the shot recipients"</span> like Crouch wrote. Why would vaccinated people start dying rapidly years after vaccination? Is there some kind of a switch that will get triggered years after vaccination after which people will start dying rapidly?</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 Tom Haviland published a Substack post where he described McCairn's analysis of the clots. [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the</a>] Haviland wrote that Greg Harrison was the <span class="quote">"lead scientist"</span> of a team that was analyzing the clots, and that Harrison asked Hirschman to send the clots to McCairn, and that Harrison asked McCairn to check the samples for the presence of prions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laura Kasner, embalmer Richard Hirschman and I have been in contact for the last year with a <span class="red">scientific team led by retired organic chemist Mr. Greg Harrison</span>. Greg's team, which is spread over several continents and includes scientists at several unnamed universities, have been analyzing samples of the <span class="quote">"white fibrous clots"</span> provided by Hirschman, trying to determine their exact composition and the mechanism by which these strange clots are forming.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><span class="red">Lead scientist Greg Harrison</span> wondered if this abnormally high amount of phosphorus in the white fibrous clots could be partly or largely responsible for why the clots were forming.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><span class="red">Greg asked Richard Hirschman to send multiple samples of the white fibrous clots to Dr. Kevin McCairn</span>, a distinguished neuroscientist in Japan who has spent his career studying the effects of amyloid proteins on patients suffering from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. <span class="red">Greg asked Dr. McCairn to check the white fibrous clot samples for the presence of prions.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haviland's Substack post included a document called <code>Kevin_Mccairn_Findings.pdf</code> which described the results of McCairn's analysis of the clots. The authors of the document were anonymous and the document was signed <span class="quote">"The Researchers"</span>, but McCairn told me he was not involved in writing the document. However one of the authors was probably Greg Harrison, because in 2024 Laura Kasner posted another similar PDF about the clots, where the cover of the PDF said that the <span class="quote">"authors remain anonymous for safety reasons"</span> even though Kasner wrote that Greg Harrison was one of the authors. [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed</a>]</p>
<p>The document about McCairn's findings said that <span class="quote">"ORF-19 and ORF-11 are now functionally implicated in the induction of prionic seeding"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnorf.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The names of ORFs were written with a hyphen in the PDF. The names of ORFs are normally written without a hyphen, but Greg Harrison and Wayne Crouch have both written the names of ORFs with a hyphen. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22orf-19%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22orf-19%22&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://puremediaaustralia.org/reading-room-1/f/an-unholy-triadthe-birth-of-a-plague-episode03?blogcategory=TECHNOLOGY>https://puremediaaustralia.org/reading-room-1/f/an-unholy-triadthe-birth-of-a-plague-episode03?blogcategory=TECHNOLOGY</a>]</p>
<p>McCairn told me: <span class="quote">"You seem incapable of understanding that I am working independently and the only link is that is that Greg claims to have done some investigation on the clots. What he has done has nothing to do with my lab analysis."</span> But I linked to the <code>Kevin_Mccairn_Findings.pdf</code> document and asked him: <span class="quote">"If you're so independent from Greg et al. then why did they write this report about your findings?"</span> And McCairn replied: <span class="quote">"I have no idea, and I did not give them permission to write that report or associate it with me any way."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a section called <span class="quote">"Prion Research Investigation Project"</span>. It includes a stock photo of people in a lab that I thought looked just like the stock video of people in labs in An Unholy Triad: [<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/prion-research-investigation-project/>https://synapteklabs.com/prion-research-investigation-project/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>But then I found that McCairn's stock photo came from the same collection of stock footage that was used in An Unholy Triad: [<a href=https://elements.envato.com/microbiologist-doctor-taking-a-blood-sample-tube-f-6RYNWUU>https://elements.envato.com/microbiologist-doctor-taking-a-blood-sample-tube-f-6RYNWUU</a>, <a href=https://elements.envato.com/user/DC_Studio/stock-video?searchTerm=lab>https://elements.envato.com/user/DC_Studio/stock-video?searchTerm=lab</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock-2.jpg width=500><img src=i/clot-stock-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I thought that the stock photo on McCairn's website might have been a clue that the same people who made An Unholy Triad were also involved in making McCairn's website. But McCairn told me that the page on his website was made by Chris France, who has also made other parts of his website. Chris France didn't answer me when I asked him how he picked the stock image.</p>
<hr />
<p>Greg's AI seems to have prophesied the results of McCairn's Rt-QuIC analysis, because in December 2024 Greg wrote: <span class="quote">"Thx Kevin, will send you emails with word docs attached in which AI is now telling us we have identified a new blood-born Amyloid-prion disease. All is conjecture but AI seems highly convinced we shall soon identify this new Amyloid-Prion hybrid disease with deep NMR's &amp; RT-QuIC, plus a few more techniques to properly nail it.

The 12 embalmers white clots samples provided yesterday to Dr Kevin McCairn for RAMAN &amp; RT-QuIC analysis will reveal &amp; substantiate the facts presented in this video series."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1898486854099550605>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1898486854099550605</a>]</p>
<p>Greg Harrison is promoting a similar narrative about a prion apocalypse as McCairn. Wayne Crouch's cohost lady also says that there's a prion apocalypse coming: [<a href=https://x.com/lisarose030387/status/1909497793338917050>https://x.com/lisarose030387/status/1909497793338917050</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-johnston.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Episode 4 of season 2 of An Unholy Triad presented a scenario of a prion apocalypse. [<a href=https://fxtwitter.com/WayneC50256258/status/1915234229820232134>https://fxtwitter.com/WayneC50256258/status/1915234229820232134</a>] First people started growing calamari clots, then the clots led to the formation of prions, and then the prions ended up in wastewater, and from the wastewater the prions ended up in the sea, and in the sea the prions entered into fish which were eaten by humans, and also seawater was full of prions so it led to the formation of deadly prion rain, and in the end all of humanity died.</p>
<hr />
<p>In February 2025 Kevin McCairn appeared in a video about the white clots on Steve Kirsch's VSRF channel, which also featured Kevin McKernan, Richard Hirschman, Tom Haviland, and Greg Harrison. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6k0oav-vsrf-live-164-white-clot-roundtable.html>https://rumble.com/v6k0oav-vsrf-live-164-white-clot-roundtable.html</a>] Kirsch seems to have been a central player in the story about the white clots, because he was one of the very first big names in alt media who started talking about the clots, and I think he was the second person after Jane Ruby who interviewed Richard Hirschman. And I think Kirsch was the first person who interviewed Anna Foster and Cary Watkins, who were the next two people after Hirschman who said they had seen the clots. And the Died Suddenly also movie included more footage of Kirsch than any other person apart from Hirschman, and the results of Haviland's embalmer surveys were published by Kirsch, and Kirsch has hosted video roundtables about the clots. So I thought that McCairn might have somehow become involved with the clots through Kirsch, because J.J. Couey said: <span class="quote">"Steve Kirsch wanted me to evaluate Kevin McCairn's grant proposal in 2022, and we had a nice little text exchange on my phone about that. And so there again, he even offered to send me to Tokyo to help him work, and help him do those experiments."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpTQNgFCKZw&t=1h30m25s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpTQNgFCKZw&amp;t=1h30m25s</a>] So I asked McCairn on his Discord if he was getting paid by Kirsch, but he told me: <span class="quote">"No money from Kirsch, I did send him a grant proposal though, he took my grant and proposed a US institute carry out the work, I didn't see anything beyond that."</span> (And McCairn doesn't seem to have too many other connections to Kirsch, so perhaps it was a coincidence that McCairn had happened to earlier send a grant proposal to Kirsch.)</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 I compiled comprehensive evidence on McCairn's Discord that Greg Harrison's mystery ORFs were a hoax, so McCairn also recognized that the ORFs were fake. In April 2025 Greg Harrison tweeted: <span class="quote">"And at this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span class="quote">'rantings'</span> due to our lack of credible evidence that any of our ORF stuff actually exists"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892</a>] At first I wasn't sure if Harrison was joking or if he actually dropped the ORF hoax, but McCairn told me on his Discord: <span class="quote">"He has dropped it because I've reamed him out for it and how fucking stupid it is to be amplifying LLM hallucinations."</span> And he said: <span class="quote">"And now I'm aware of the LLM nonsense, I have told them there will be the strictest scientific standards applied, and I will not have nonsense like that as an attack vector"</span>. So it seems to have been McCairn who got Harrison to drop the ORF hoax, which might serve as evidence against a hypothesis that McCairn was somehow complicit in Harrison's disinformation operation. But on the other hand the story about the ORFs was so clearly fake that it not only discredited Harrison but also people associated with him, which would've movivated people associated with him to tell him to drop the story.</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on his Discord how he first got connected to Greg Harrison, he replied: <span class="quote">"Here <span class="citation" data-cites="Henjin">@Henjin</span> is a screenshot of first emails, with time stamps with respect to Greg and Richard. Why don't we start here so you can order your thinking a little better. As memory serves I was involved in a Skype call, it was a group of researchers who had been looking at histological sections of blood from patients that showed microclotting where they presented their histological findings and I initially advised them on how to proceed to stain their tissue for presence of amyloid."</span> And later he also explained: <span class="quote">"As I recall it was meeting with clinicians who have worked with Richard to begin to measure and quantify what the clots were. They were trying to do thioflavin staining, but lacked the equipment necessary for precise histology. He was a part of that call, I didn't know him but he was obviously co-ordinating with Richard and the clinician group in Alabhama who are treating amyloidogenic microclots. As they were making procedural errors in trying to type the tissue, and I had the facilities available, i offered to process the tissue properly so that histological staining for amyloids was done correctly. I have received no money from them to do this or for the subsequent anlayses I have done using RT-QuIC, SEM/EDX and Raman spectroscopy. All of those methods have confirmed an amyloidogenic signature. Does that make sense?"</span> I recall McCairn had also tried to get samples of calamari clots to analyze long before he was connected to Harrison.</p>
<p>So as of now it's more or less clear that SOS is deliberately producing disinformation, but it's not yet clear if McCairn is complicit in their operation, or if McCairn is an independent analyst who got inadvertently involved with SOS because he volunteered to help with the histological staining analysis, or because he was trying to find samples of calamari clots to analyze.</p>
<p>But in the case the clots are fake and Harrison and Hirschman know themselves the clots are fake, would they trust someone who was not in on the scam to analyze the clots? People who had presented an analysis of the clots before McCairn include Mike Adams, Ryan Cole, Ana Maria Mihalcea, Clifford Carnicom, Zandre Botha, Arne Burkhardt, and Greg Harrison. But I believe all of them are controlled opposition. (Arne Burkhardt and Ryan Cole were also among the earliest people who started promoting the turbo cancer hoax, so I explained why I think they are controlled opposition on my page about turbo cancer: <a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>When I asked Grok to list people who have presented a laboratory analysis of calamari clots, the first two people it listed were Mike Adams and Greg Harrison. Grok said that McCairn's Raman and RT-QuIC analysis was done by <span class="quote">"Harrison's team"</span>, because Grok cited a Substack post by Nicolas Hulscher who gave the impression that McCairn's analysis was done by Harrison's team: [<a href=https://thefocalpoints.com/p/microscopic-and-biochemical-analysis>https://thefocalpoints.com/p/microscopic-and-biochemical-analysis</a>]</p>

<p>In March 2025 Philip McMillan did one video about Kevin McCairn's analysis of calamari clots, one video where he talked about Greg's ORFs and how McCairn had found the clots were autofluorescent, and another one video about an AI-generated document which had mystery ORFs going up to ORF100:</p>

</h3>
<p>Richard Hirschman tweeted an image that was supposed to show a scanning electron microscope photo of a calamari clot taken by Kevin McCairn. Hirschman said the image showed amyloid fibrin, but in the replies Ian Musgrave said it was not correct: [<a href=https://x.com/ianfmusgrave/status/1915194687507620135>https://x.com/ianfmusgrave/status/1915194687507620135</a>]</p>
<p><img src=i/clot-amyloidfibrin.jpg width=550></p>
<p>This is how McCairn described the image shown by Hirschman: <span class="quote">"When you go down to 5,000 times, what you see here - and it's only because unfamiliar with looking at these structures, that this was a standout abnormal to me, right - there are very clear nodular forms on these peptides, okay. I don't know if you can see that, right, so my cursor is here, right, like this will stick out. And if we look at this primary branch here, what you see is - fibrin should be a long smooth rope-like peptide that essentially just overlays itself to form the network around which platelets and other tissues that form a clot - can aggregate, okay. Here what you're looking at is a - and so, you're looking at very abnormal structural properties that are standout to someone who's familiar with looking at peptides in and of themselves, okay. And those are these nodular forms, and also - what I would point out to people is that - pay attention to this thicker filament, right, and um, in biology, often what you see - and that's not the best example that I can give for people to think about - is often when you look at a tree, a tree, as you look at the trunk has a sort of twisting effect to it, right. It sort of starts at the roots, and it sort of has a rotation to it, as it goes up to form the branch area of the tree. But the trunk often, if you pay attention to it, you'll see it has a rotation to it. And generally in biology, I would say it's a right-hand rotation, it's the right hand rule of thumb, and you can get into all sorts of metaphysics around electrodynamics and what that - how that relates to the body. But in this instance, what you're seeing is that you're seeing a faster twist - so rotations per unit of distance - than you would expect to see in normal healthy tissue."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6sd87z-warning-global-amyloidogenic-health-disaster-with-dr-kevin-mccairn.html?start=6479>https://rumble.com/v6sd87z-warning-global-amyloidogenic-health-disaster-with-dr-kevin-mccairn.html?start=6479</a>] (He kept saying that fibrin was a peptide. But fibrin is not even a peptide but a protein. Peptides are short chains of about 50 or fewer amino acids.)</p>
<p>When McCairn showed an SEM image of the same sample at a 250-fold magnification level, he said: <span class="quote">"Now we're going down to 250 times, and we're going past what a light microscope can reliably do."</span> [time 1:43:21] Optical microscopes go up to about 1000x to 1500x magnification level due to the diffraction limit of light, so at first I was confused by his statement. But ChatGPT said that an SEM at 250x magnification can show more details than an optical microscope at 1500x magnification, which does makes sense. (Even though McCairn's image at a 5000x magnification level still has a very low level of detail for an SEM image.)</p>
<p>In the video by McCairn I linked, he also showed images of the same sample at 250x and 1000x magnification. (Edited later: I replaced the screenshots from the video with higher-quality images from here: <a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3RjTGpEVWs&t=1h27m33s.><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3RjTGpEVWs&amp;t=1h27m33s" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3RjTGpEVWs&amp;t=1h27m33s</a>.</a>)</p>

In McCairn's image the strands have a diameter of about 0.2 to 3 µm, but in the other image even the widest strands have a diameter of only about 0.3 µm:</p>

Image A shows regular spaghetti-like strands of fibrin that have a fairly uniform diameter of about 0.1 µm. But in image B where fibrin was clotted in the presence of the lipid DPPC, the fibrin formed wide irregularly shaped structures, so branches of the structure have a diameter on the micrometer level like in McCairn's image. Image B was described like this: <span class="quote">"In contrast, in the DPPC MLV suspension the heterogeneous large-pore gels are formed with thin branched fibers and lipid particles incorporated into the gel structure (Figure 1, B). The images reveal many free fiber terminations. Fibers appeared to be highly adhesive forming dense mats and tight bundles."</span> DPPC is a lipid, and MLV means multilameral vesicle which is a type of liposome, so the balls circled in image B are balls of lipid: [<a href=https://sci-hub.se/downloads/2019-10-29/09/faizullin2019.pdf>https://sci-hub.se/downloads/2019-10-29/09/faizullin2019.pdf</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>I also found a paper where fibrin clots were created in the presence of a fibrinolytic compound, which resulted in the formation of wide fibers with a diameter of about 0.5 to 3 µm: [<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/20/8/495>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/20/8/495</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>The branches in McCairn's image had a diameter of about 0.2 to 3 µm. ChatGPT said that fibrin structures with a diameter on the micrometer level are unlikely to consist of individual fibrin polymers, but rather bundles of multiple fibrin polymers glued together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, fibrin fibers (the building blocks of a blood clot) have diameters typically in the range of 50 to 200 nanometers (nm), sometimes up to 500 nm. So 0.05-0.5 µm is usual.</p>
<p>However, under abnormal or pathological conditions, fibrin fibers can become thicker, but usually not to the extent of 1 µm, and very rarely close to 10 µm as single fibers.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Bundles of fibers can easily be 1-10 µm in diameter - but those are <em>multiple fibers glued together</em>, not single fibrin polymers.</p>
<p>Single fibrin fibers, even under weird conditions, very rarely cross the 1 µm diameter threshold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However later ChatGPT said that even fibers of fibrin with a diameter over 1 µm might not necessarily consist of multiple narrower fibers glued together, but wide fibers might also be formed due to a greater degree of lateral aggregation in the stage where the protofibrils form into fibrils:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thick fibrin fibers with diameters over 1 micrometer generally form through a <strong>similar basic polymerization process</strong> as regular thin fibers (around 0.1 micrometer), but there are important differences in how they become thick.</p>
<p>Both thick and thin fibrin fibers start with the <strong>same initial steps</strong>: thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to create fibrin monomers, which then align end-to-end to form <strong>protofibrils</strong>, and protofibrils laterally aggregate to form <strong>fibrils</strong>. In thinner fibers, this lateral aggregation is moderate - a few protofibrils come together to form a fibril, and those fibrils form relatively fine fibers.</p>
<p>For <strong>thicker fibers</strong>, the key difference is that <strong>more extensive lateral association</strong> occurs. Multiple protofibrils aggregate side-by-side <strong>more completely</strong>, and sometimes <strong>additional bundling</strong> happens between already-formed fibrils. There is evidence that under certain conditions - such as low fibrinogen concentration, low ionic strength, or altered thrombin activity - <strong>multiple narrow fibers can clump together</strong> after initial formation, effectively fusing into <strong>wider fibers</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, thick fibers (&gt;1 µm diameter) can result from <strong>both mechanisms</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>More extensive lateral aggregation during initial assembly</strong>, leading to inherently thicker fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Post-assembly bundling or merging</strong> of multiple narrower fibers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If indeed McCairn's image does even show fibrin structures, then I don't know if the thickest branches in his image are bundles of multiple strands of fibrin joined together, or if they are just single wide strands of fibrin. McCairn said that his image showed misfolded fibrin because the branches had an irregular and twisted shape, and the branches didn't look like smooth spaghetti like regular fibrin. But it may have been because he was looking at structures that were made up of bundles of fibrin and not individual strands of fibrin. (And the clumping of the strands may have been if for example the fibrin structure formed in the presence of a lipid or a fibrinolytic compound, and not necessarily because the fibrin was misfolded.)</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn why his SEM image had such a poor level of detail, he said: <span class="quote">"The difference in detail comes from using a graphene base vs glass slide, and other factors, backscatter acquisition from surface or combined."</span> When I asked why he couldn't use a graphene base, he said: <span class="quote">"I use glass to be able run Raman on the same sample."</span></p>
<p>He also posted another similarly blurry SEM image at a 5000-fold magnification level (but it does seem to be a real SEM image judging from the EXIF metadata, which even includes the serial number of the Hitachi TM4000 instrument):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-blurry.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>One reason why I questioned if McCairn's images were actually taken with an SEM was that I had the impression McCairn said he had bought his own SEM, but it would've seemed like an unnecessarily expensive purchase, and I hadn't seen an SEM in his lab in his videos. For example in a video where he showed his SEM images, he showed a photo of the Hitachi TM4000 SEM and he said <span class="quote">"It costs serious money to go and get this type of data, ok. The machine you're looking at there is hundreds of thousands of dollars."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6s3wjv-prion-clusters-excess-neuro-burden-in-the-young-promising-therapeutic-lab-d.html?start=6374>https://rumble.com/v6s3wjv-prion-clusters-excess-neuro-burden-in-the-young-promising-therapeutic-lab-d.html?start=6374</a>] And in a tweet he posted before he had done the SEM and Raman analysis of the clots, he said that the SEM and Raman analysis would cost him about 150,000 USD, which made me think he was going to buy his own SEM instrument. [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1871484694598238475>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1871484694598238475</a>] But McCairn told me on his Discord that he didn't end up buying his own SEM instrument, but he visited a lab in Japan to do the SEM and Raman analysis, and he linked to an old video where he visited the same lab and used the Hitachi TM4000 microscope. [<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/w/gwHJwtgbTVGZkYNqA1rxe2>https://t.wtyl.live/w/gwHJwtgbTVGZkYNqA1rxe2</a>] And he said that the lab time <span class="quote">"averages $1500 a day all costs included"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-labtime.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Richard Hirschman also said: <span class="quote">"We've got now Kevin McCairn who's done this work. It costs lots of money. This equipment that he uses costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not like you can just walk up somewhere and have this work done."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1920255597993189611>https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1920255597993189611</a>, 1:16:59] But he was wrong because McCairn just visited some random lab to do the SEM and Raman analysis, and it didn't cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One McCairn's followers went around asking billionaires to donate money to McCairn because he said McCairn <span class="quote">"LITERALLY JUST NEEDS A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT AND COULD SAVE EVERYONE FROM DYING HORRIBLY"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915925037430751313>https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915925037430751313</a>, <a href=https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915928819808035265>https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915928819808035265</a>]</p>

<p>Added later: McCairn posted these screenshots of a ChatGPT conversation: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1919788047870394613>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1919788047870394613</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>I replied to him: <span class="quote">"Can you share the full chat? Those responses seem too good to be true, or like they conform too closely to what you're saying about the clots. Did you previously tell ChatGPT about your views? It even addressed you as <span class="quote">'Dr. McCairn'</span>."</span> And I showed him the screenshot below and said that when I gave the same prompt to ChatGPT on a fresh account, it didn't say anything about fibrin clots, but it said that <span class="quote">"The fibrous network resembles that of electrospun fibers, biodegradable scaffold materials, or collagen matrices, commonly used in tissue engineering"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-semgpt-5.png width=600>
</div>
<p>This was McCairn's explanation: <span class="quote">"That's because I use the LLM properly, constraining it with a domain specialty based off my previous published works, and that it's role is to act as a colleague working in the same domain, with a number of academic based plugins, e.g., Consensus. As you have no published works in a formal scientific domain, you are not going to be able to use it in the same manner. And that was pretty much the extent of the exchange."</span> But he didn't share the full chat. And Greg Harrison has also trained his AI to believe in mystery ORFs, so does that mean that mystery ORFs are real?</p>
<p>Then McCairn told me he wasn't able to share the full chat because ChatGPT said <span class="quote">"Sharing conversations with user uploaded images is not yet supported"</span>, which does seem to be a real limitation of ChatGPT, but which was also convenient for him. [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1919912314670874790>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1919912314670874790</a>] And it's not even possible to save the full chat history by printing to PDF or by taking a screenshot of the body node in devtools.</p>
<p>When I showed the same image to ChatGPT and asked <span class="quote">"what would cause fibrin to have this shape"</span>, it gave me a list of 7 possible reasons, but they didn't even include the fibrin being misfolded:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibrinshape.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Added later: When I asked McCairn why the strands in his image have a diameter of about 3-30 µm even though strands of fibrin normally have a diameter of about 0.1 µm, he replied: <span class="quote">"That would be because they are highly amyloidogenic and diseased as is obvious through the structural abnormalities, which is supported by the positive signals with thioflavin, Raman spec, and reactivity under RT-QuIC protocols."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1922995808489632024>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1922995808489632024</a>] But I don't know how he can be so sure about it, if he hasn't even looked at regular fibrin clots under an SEM. I had a hard time even finding images of what <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic"</span> fibrin clots are supposed to look like.</p>
<p>When I tried searching for more images of unusually thick amyloid clots, I found the image below where image A is a normal control, and images B to D were abnormal clots from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Image C has some some strands that have a diameter of about 0.3 µm, but it mostly just looks like several narrower strands of fibrin joined together: [<a href=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.577523/full>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.577523/full</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-thick-pretorius-kell.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>But in general the structures in McCairn's image look like they are outside the range of variation of what SEM images of fibrin clots look like, even if the clots are abnormal. The strands in the clots don't have such variable width as McCairn's strands, or if they do then the wider segments look like they consis of multiple strands joined together, and not a single solid wide strand.</p>
<p>McCairn posted this tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1923121243982610469>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1923121243982610469</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-semtweet.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>But I told him that the average fiber diameter in the group treated with LPS is still about 100 nm. And in all images there's a much higher number of strands visible than in his image, even though the images display a width of about 8 µm but his image shows a width of about 25 µm.</p>
<p>And I posted this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h3>
<p><strong>Image 1 (Cryostat Sliced Sample at 5000X):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 10 µm</li>
<li><strong>Magnification:</strong> 5000X</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The fibrin or fibrous structures appear <strong>thicker, less organized</strong>, and more sponge-like or amorphous. There is an absence of the distinct linear fiber morphology typical of fibrin networks.</li>
<li><strong>Possible interpretation:</strong> This might not be a classical fibrin network; it could be a cross-linked, dehydrated, or otherwise altered biological matrix, possibly involving extracellular matrix or degraded clot components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image 2 (Fibrin with and without LPS, 1 µm scale):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 1 µm</li>
<li><strong>Panels (a), (b), (c):</strong> Clearly show <strong>classic fibrin fibers</strong> - long, thin, thread-like structures.</li>
<li><strong>Panel (d):</strong> Quantifies fiber diameters: control fibers have a median around 103-133 nm, while LPS-exposed fibers are thicker (~165-347 nm), but still distinctly fibrous.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scale-comparison">Scale Comparison</h3>
<ul>
<li>Image 1 has a 10 µm scale bar, while Image 2 has a 1 µm scale bar.</li>
<li>Even adjusting for this, Image 1 shows <strong>much thicker and less defined structures</strong>, not matching the characteristic ~100-300 nm fibrin fibers seen in Image 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>The structures in Image 1 are not consistent with classic fibrin fibers</strong> as seen in Image 2, either due to differences in sample preparation (e.g., cryostat slicing), degradation, or they represent a different biological material altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also told him that his image has a lot of variability in diameter within different parts of the same strand, and I told him ChatGPT offered the following as possible explanations for the variability in diameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="cryostat-slicing-artifacts">1. Cryostat Slicing Artifacts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cryostat sectioning at <strong>5 µm</strong> can compress or shear soft tissues and networks.</li>
<li>Uneven mechanical forces during slicing can deform fibrin strands, leading to <strong>local thinning or broadening</strong> along the same strand.</li>
<li>Ice crystal formation and sublimation during freezing can create voids or distortions, especially in hydrated networks like fibrin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sem-imaging-of-hydrated-or-non-coated-samples">2. SEM Imaging of Hydrated or Non-Coated Samples</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the sample was not <strong>properly fixed, dehydrated, and sputter-coated</strong>, charging effects or dehydration shrinkage can cause parts of the strand to collapse or appear thicker/thinner.</li>
<li><strong>Beam interaction</strong> in SEM (15 kV in this case) can exaggerate differences in apparent thickness depending on density and topography.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biological-heterogeneity-in-fibrin-structure">3. Biological Heterogeneity in Fibrin Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin fibers are <strong>not perfectly uniform</strong>; they can merge, branch, or bundle. This causes <strong>natural variation in diameter</strong>, especially in cross-linked or aged clots.</li>
<li>Regions of <strong>dense cross-linking</strong> or association with other clot components (e.g., platelets, RBC ghosts, ECM proteins) may appear thicker or more amorphous.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone should try to run SEM on a fresh calamari clot that has just been extracted for comparison, if such a thing even existed.</p>
<p>McCairn told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don't you in your input for your weak LLM rebuttals the following additional data.</p>
<p>1. The material has extensive autofluorescence.<br> 2. The tissue stains positive with thioflavin<br> 3. The sample test positive for Raman peak at 1720cm<br> 4. The clot causes a positive amyloidogenic cascade in the RT-QuIC protocol.</p>
<p>Then put the response, here for all to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I posted the response below and wrote: <span class="quote">"Well it did say your points explain the structure of your image, even though I don't know if it's a case of the bias where LLMs tend to agree with the user."</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the listed observations strongly support that the structure in <strong>Image 1</strong> is <strong>amyloidogenic</strong>, which explains the atypical, <strong>irregular, matted, and dense morphology</strong> seen in the SEM image.</p>
<p>Here's how each point aligns:</p>
<h3 id="extensive-autofluorescence">1. Extensive Autofluorescence</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils are known to exhibit autofluorescence due to their <strong>cross-β-sheet structure</strong> and <strong>dense protein packing</strong>, which alter their optical properties. This supports the presence of <strong>protein aggregates</strong> rather than normal fibrin fibers.</p>
<h3 id="positive-thioflavin-staining">2. Positive Thioflavin Staining</h3>
<p>Thioflavin (T or S) binds specifically to <strong>β-sheet-rich amyloid structures</strong>. A positive result confirms that the fibrin in the clot has undergone a pathological conformational change to form <strong>amyloid-like aggregates</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="raman-peak-at-1720-cm¹">3. Raman Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹</h3>
<p>A peak near 1720 cm⁻¹ is typically associated with <strong>carbonyl vibrations (C=O)</strong> and <strong>altered protein secondary structure</strong>, commonly found in <strong>amyloid fibrils</strong> or oxidatively modified proteins. This suggests structural changes consistent with amyloidosis.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rt-quic-amyloid-cascade">4. Positive RT-QuIC Amyloid Cascade</h3>
<p>RT-QuIC detects the <strong>seeding activity</strong> of misfolded proteins. A positive result indicates the sample can <strong>propagate amyloid-like fibril formation</strong>, confirming prion-like behavior, which is incompatible with normal fibrin function.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These findings indicate that the material in Image 1 is not standard fibrin but is <strong>misfolded, amyloidogenic fibrin(ogen)</strong>. This explains the abnormal morphology: <strong>thick, irregular, matted strands</strong> lacking the well-ordered, thread-like appearance of healthy fibrin networks (as seen in Image 2). This pathology is often observed in <strong>chronic inflammation, sepsis, or systemic amyloidosis-like clotting disorders.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I further asked <span class="quote">"do amyloid properties explain why image 1 has only a few strands visible, wide strands, and high variability in diameter within strands"</span>, I got the following answer from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="few-visible-strands">1. Few Visible Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloidogenic fibrin tends to <strong>aggregate into dense, fused masses</strong> rather than forming discrete, well-separated fibers. Misfolded fibrin(ogen) often loses the ability to form normal polymeric networks, instead creating <strong>amorphous or sheet-like clumps</strong>. This results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer discernible individual fibers</li>
<li>More extensive background material or merged structures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wide-strands">2. Wide Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils in blood clots form through <strong>cross-β-sheet stacking</strong>, which encourages <strong>lateral association</strong> of protofibrils. This can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the <strong>apparent diameter</strong> of strands</li>
<li>Create <strong>flattened, ribbon-like structures</strong></li>
<li>Produce fibers much thicker than physiological fibrin (~100-300 nm), consistent with what's seen in Image 1 (often several microns wide)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-variability-in-diameter-within-strands">3. High Variability in Diameter Within Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid formation is a <strong>heterogeneous and non-uniform process</strong>, influenced by local:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeding concentrations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oxidative stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interactions with other biomolecules</strong> (e.g. lipids, LPS, iron)</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregular lateral growth</li>
<li>Incomplete or uneven fibril merging</li>
<li><strong>Segmental variation in strand width</strong> (i.e., bulges, tapering, or constricted areas)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Yes - <strong>amyloidogenesis fundamentally alters the structure and assembly of fibrin</strong>, and this explains the <strong>low fiber count, wide fused strands, and diameter variability</strong> in Image 1. These features are consistent with a <strong>pathological, amyloid-rich clot</strong>, not a normal fibrin network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his presentations McCairn should've offered a similar explanation for why amyloid properties might explain the anomalous features. I don't recall McCairn having said anything about the unusual diameter of the strands until I brought it up on his Discord, let alone offer an explanation for why the wide diameter might be explained by amyloid properties. And he similarly hasn't brought attention to how his image shows only a small number of individual strands compared to other SEM images of fibrin clots that display a comparable area, let alone offer an explanation for why that would be the case.</p>
<p>And in order to evaluate whether the properties he observed were due to the preservation or preparation of the sample, McCairn could've also taken an SEM image of a freshly extracted calamari clot for comparison, or an image of a regular non-calamari fibrin clot that had been preserved and prepared the same way as his sample.</p>

<p>A user on Kevin McCairn's Discord called Mr. Micronicle has been posting various microscope images on the server, including images that he claimed showed calamari clots that came from the body of a dead person, even though he refused to answer me where he obtained the clots.</p>
<p>Mr. Micronicle also said that he took microscope photos of his blood stained with Thioflavin T, and he showed an image of a fiber-like object with a diameter of about 10-20 µm. Then Kevin McCairn said <span class="quote">"That is the amyloid fibril, good job and nice image capture"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-microniclefibril.jpg width=722>
</div>
<p>I posted this reply to McCairn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be an aggregate structure that consists of multiple fibrils? A single fibril would be much narrower based on what ChatGPT said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amyloid fibrils are very thin protein aggregates.</li>
<li>Their diameter typically ranges from 7 to 13 nanometers (nm), regardless of where they form (blood, organs, brain, etc.).</li>
<li>In blood-related diseases like AA amyloidosis or AL amyloidosis, amyloid fibrils circulate or deposit, and their size remains in that typical range.</li>
<li>Cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) and atomic force microscopy studies have shown that some fibrils can be as thin as 6 nm or up to about 15 nm, depending on the specific protein involved and conditions of formation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn responded: <span class="quote">"All peptides are aggregate structures. Depends on the method of aggregation though and their resistance to proteases as to how we classify them as pathogenic."</span> But I showed that ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In scientific terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibril</strong> is understood to be a <strong>very thin</strong>, <strong>elongated</strong> structure, usually <strong>in the nanometer scale</strong> for diameter (approximately <strong>7-13 nanometers</strong> for amyloid fibrils).</li>
<li>Structures that are <strong>micrometers wide</strong> (especially <strong>10 micrometers</strong>, which is about <strong>1,000 times thicker</strong> than a typical fibril) would more accurately be called:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundles of fibrils</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aggregates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fibers</strong> or <strong>fiber-like structures</strong> (sometimes used when many fibrils associate)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a <strong>10 micrometer</strong>-wide formation would be considered a <strong>fiber</strong> or an <strong>aggregate of fibrils</strong>, rather than a single fibril itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"It is a fibril, singular, of oligomerized amyloidogenic fibrin. That description is correct."</span> But I showed him that ChatGPT responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In principle, <strong>no</strong> - if you are using a <strong>standard light microscope</strong>, it would not be possible to image <strong>a single fibril</strong> of <strong>oligomerized amyloidogenic fibrin</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>single fibril</strong> (even one formed by fibrin adopting amyloid-like structure) would have a <strong>diameter of around 6-15 nanometers</strong>, sometimes slightly thicker depending on conditions.</li>
<li>The <strong>diffraction limit</strong> of optical microscopy (~200-250 nm) means anything thinner than that cannot be resolved as a distinct object.</li>
<li>Therefore, under a standard light microscope, what you would see would be <strong>aggregates</strong>, <strong>bundles</strong>, or <strong>dense regions</strong> of multiple fibrils - not an isolated, singular fibril.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"Fibrils (from Latin <em>fibra</em>[1]) are structural biological materials found in nearly all living organisms. Not to be confused with fibers or filaments, fibrils tend to have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nanometers (whereas fibers are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have diameters approximately 10–50 nanometers in size)."</span> [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril</a>]</p>
<p>McCairn's defense was that the calamari clots were a novel phenomenon that required a novel vernacular, so it was acceptable for him to use the word <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> in an unconventional sense. He told me: <span class="quote">"Trying to use old vernacular to a new blood prion disorder will lead the spergs like you to blow a fuse, but you'll just have to put up with it."</span></p>
<p>Then McCairn said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"Nothing <span class="citation" data-cites="henjin">@henjin</span> is sore that there have been multiple replications of the same phenomena and that they satisfy the metrics required to call them amyloidogenic peptides."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"You mean the fibrin or other proteins in the clots contain segments that act as amyloidogenic peptides? It wouldn't make sense to say that the clots themselves are amyloidogenic peptides."</span> And I pointed out that ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, <strong>no</strong>, it is <strong>not accurate</strong> to say that <strong>fibrin clots themselves</strong> are <strong>amyloidogenic peptides</strong>. Here is the proper interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>peptide</strong> refers to a <strong>small chain of amino acids</strong>, typically much shorter than full proteins.</li>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is a <strong>full-length, large polymeric protein</strong> (~340 kDa before cleavage), not a small peptide.</li>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is a <strong>macroscopic network</strong> formed by <strong>polymerized fibrin monomers</strong>, often extending hundreds of micrometers across - not a single molecular entity or a simple peptide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is <strong>not</strong> itself a <strong>peptide</strong>. It is a <strong>supramolecular structure</strong> made of many fibrin molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloidogenic peptides</strong> are <strong>smaller fragments</strong> or <strong>sequences</strong> capable of forming amyloid fibrils on their own.</li>
<li>In pathological conditions, <strong>portions of the fibrin molecule</strong> <strong>become amyloidogenic</strong> - <strong>but the entire clot</strong> should be referred to as an <strong>amyloid-rich structure</strong> or <strong>amyloid-like fibrin network</strong>, <strong>not</strong> as a <span class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accurate phrasing would be</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="quote">"Fibrin clots can adopt <strong>amyloid-like structures</strong>."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Amyloid fibrin contains <strong>amyloidogenic regions</strong> within the fibrin protein."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Pathological fibrin clots exhibit <strong>amyloid features</strong>."</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then McCairn just said that <span class="quote">"we are dealing with a novel phenomenon, and as such the current repertoire of nomenclature does not fit well"</span>. But he wasn't willing to admit that he used the wrong terminology.</p>
<p>Earlier I had also called him out for saying that fibrin was a peptide, even though a peptide is a short chain of 50 or fewer amino acids, but fibrin is a polymerized protein product of fibrinogen, and each fibrinogen unit in turn is made up of 6 proteins that each have a length of about 400-600 amino acids. McCairn's response was that <span class="quote">"You should also be reminded that the vernacular peptide and protein are interchangeable."</span> But I pointed out that ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it would <strong>not</strong> really be correct - even in casual speech - to call <strong>fibrin</strong> a <strong>peptide</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is <strong>very large</strong> - it's made by polymerizing fibrinogen, which itself is almost <strong>3000 amino acids</strong> long.</li>
<li>Even a <strong>single fibrin monomer</strong> (before polymerization) is <strong>way too big</strong> to be called a <span class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
<li><strong>Peptides</strong> usually refer to <strong>short chains</strong> - dozens, or maybe a few hundred amino acids at most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling fibrin a <strong>peptide</strong> would sound wrong to most people familiar with biology, even casually. It's much better (and more natural) to call fibrin a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Polymerized protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Fibrillar protein</strong>, depending on context.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If Kevin McCairn sees a fiber-like structure under a microscope, he says it's an amyloid fibril, in the same way that Ana Maria Mihalcea would say the same fiber is a Morgellons fiber or a carbon nanotube, and Mike Adams would say it's a nanowire interface structure. McCairn gets mad at me when I compare him to the nanobot guys, but when I asked Grok to list people who have analyzed the calamari clots in a lab, it told me: <span class="quote">"The individuals listed primarily rely on anecdotal observations, microscopy, or preliminary laboratory tests (e.g., RT-QuIC, spectroscopy) without peer-reviewed publication or independent replication. Their claims often involve nanotechnology, synthetic biology, or prion-like structures, which are not supported by mainstream medical research."</span></p>

<p>During a video presentation Kevin McCairn showed the image below and said that <span class="quote">"This long strand here is an abnormal fibril from a known vaccine injured patient."</span> [<a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/</a>, time 2:21:13]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>I think he is using the term <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> wrong, because ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <strong>"fibril"</strong> is typically used in biology and materials science to refer to <strong>very fine fibers</strong>, often in the <strong>nanometer to low micrometer scale</strong> (usually less than 1 µm in diameter). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrils</strong> are generally <strong>5-15 nanometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Collagen fibrils</strong> are typically <strong>50-500 nanometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure shown in the image, with a diameter in the range of <strong>10-20 micrometers (µm)</strong>, would more accurately be described as a <strong>fiber</strong> or <strong>filament</strong> rather than a <span class="quote">"fibril."</span> A <strong>10-20 µm</strong> diameter is quite large for something labeled as a <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> in the conventional biological context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same image was featured on a section of McCairn's website where he advertised his abnormal fibril detection services. But the text next to the image looked like AI was asked to describe what was shown in the image, which inspires great confidence in his skill in analyzing abnormal fibrils: [<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said that the black structure was not an amyloid fibril based on its size, but it said it might have a synthetic fiber or a fungal hypha. It said this about the fine white network pattern that surrounded the dark structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resembles a <strong>diffraction or interference pattern</strong> and could arise from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase contrast or DIC microscopy artifacts</strong>, especially when imaging something highly refractive or birefringent like crystallized proteins or aggregated biomolecules.</li>
<li>A <strong>precipitation halo</strong> from protein or salt crystallization.</li>
<li><strong>Denatured protein boundaries</strong>, especially if the sample was dried or subjected to UV exposure, forming boundary rings due to concentration gradients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: If this is a dried biological or chemical sample, the white halo could represent <strong>diffusion-limited growth</strong>, <strong>protein aggregation boundaries</strong>, or <strong>optical artifacts</strong> around a dense core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn said that the pattern that looked like cracked glass <span class="quote">"comes from the dried solute after adding ThT"</span>, and he said that Chris France writes his website ChatGPT but he just OKs it for publication.</p>
<p>McCairn's website also has another image of a mystery structure that he describes as a <span class="quote">"fibril"</span>, even though at time 2:22:25 in his presentation where he showed a version of the image with a scale bar, the structure in the image was shown to be about 15 µm wide:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-3.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>The structure in the image above has a fold that runs along the middle lengthwise. When I asked McCairn what the fold was, he said <span class="quote">"And the fold running length wise is indicative of it being a coherent structure, that is one of the reasons why fibril is a fair description of the phenomenon. Again this is you running into the axiom of those that can and those that can't. This is a highly unusual amyloidogenic form."</span> And when I said the structure was too big to be called a fibril, he said: <span class="quote">"And one could say fibrillar forms, but fibrils is good enough at this stage, again because of the extremely large size differential between normal amyloids and these unusual fibrin amyloids."</span> Then I asked someone else: <span class="quote">"How do you even know that the structures shown by McCairn and Micronicle are fibrin clots? I think fibrin clots wouldn't have the kind of lengthwise fold in the middle as McCairn's green mystery fibril."</span> But McCairn replied: <span class="quote">"This objection to raw data comes from your years of extensive lab experience working with amyloids, I presume?"</span> He also seemed to suggest that the two mystery fibers he showed on his website were the same type of structures as the mystery fibers in Mr. Micronicle's microscope photos, which all had a diameter of about 10-20 µm.</p>
<p>But are there even baby calamari clots that float freely in human blood, and that have a diameter of about 10 micrometers and a length of hundreds of micrometers?</p>
<p>The purpose of fibers of fibrin is to form a mesh that gets entangled with red blood cells, so the tangled mess forms a clot that blocks a punctured blood vessel: [<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1472>https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1472</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-web.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>The reason why large clots have elongated shape is because they conform to the shape of a blood vessel, like if some entangled sticky mess was poured through a tube and the tube got clogged.</p>
<p>But why would a micrometer-scale fibrin clot that float freely in the blood also have an elongated shape? Did it form inside a small blood vessel and then get dislodged?</p>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="fibrin-clot-structure-in-situ">1. Fibrin Clot Structure In Situ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin forms a <strong>mesh or network</strong> of thin fibers during clot formation, creating a <strong>gel-like matrix</strong> that stabilizes platelets and red blood cells.</li>
<li>This structure is <strong>highly entangled and irregular</strong>, not a single, uniform fiber.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shape-of-freely-moving-clots-emboli">2. Shape of Freely Moving Clots (Emboli)</h3>
<ul>
<li>When parts of a fibrin-rich thrombus <strong>dislodge and enter circulation</strong>, they become <strong>emboli</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>shape of these emboli</strong> depends on:</li>
<li><strong>Origin</strong>: Venous thrombi are often <strong>elongated or serpentine</strong>, as they form in the low-shear environment of veins.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical deformation</strong>: They may elongate as they pass through blood vessels.</li>
<li>However, emboli are generally <strong>amorphous, irregular</strong>, or <strong>elongated masses</strong>, not slender, fiber-like threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fiber-like-structures">3. Fiber-like Structures?</h3>
<ul>
<li>While fibrin fibers themselves are nanoscale or microscale strands, a <strong>free-floating clot is a bulk mass</strong> of these fibers entangled with cells and plasma proteins.</li>
<li>You will <strong>not see individual fibers</strong> moving freely in the bloodstream in vivo.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No</strong>, fibrin clots moving freely in the bloodstream <strong>do not have a fiber-like shape</strong>.</li>
<li>They are typically <strong>irregular or blob-like masses</strong>, sometimes elongated, but not single fibers or thread-like structures.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Capillaries have a diameter of about 5-10 µm, and arterioles and venules have a diameter of about 10-100 µm, so any of them might have plausibly served as vessel where a baby calamari clot with a diameter of about 10-20 µm was formed.</p>
<p>I asked McCairn that if his green structure formed inside a small blood vessel and then got dislodged, then why is it flat, and why does it have the lengthwise fold in the middle? He answered: <span class="quote">"Good question why does this diseased protein have the form it does, it should be noted it's not the only form there are irregular &amp; spheroid forms. I think it comes down to location of formation, nature of the underlying nano-scale fibril geometry, the species of protein, fibrinogen which makes long linear forms. Again we are in a process of discovery and relying on orthodox frameworks you constrain yourself to being able to competently describe it. But it's a common form, even described in the published literature."</span></p>

<p>In July 2022 Mike Adams did a video about the clots with Jane Ruby. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1dorkz-07-26-22-dr.-jane-ruby-and-the-health-ranger-reveal-post-vaxx-clot-mysterie.html>https://rumble.com/v1dorkz-07-26-22-dr.-jane-ruby-and-the-health-ranger-reveal-post-vaxx-clot-mysterie.html</a>] At the start of the video Mike Adams said that Stew Peters is a treasure for humanity. [1:32]</p>
<p>Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Dr. Van Welbergen said - he literally watched, he's got videos, he's going to show us, eventually, but he's - he watched under the microscope, these structures pull graphene from another part of the blood. It's almost like it's got a magnetism and then pulls it into itself so that it can enlarge. I want to give you another piece of information that's, it could be a part of this or not. But Mr. Hirschman, several weeks ago, said to me that he went back to his lab refrigerator to put some additional samples in. And he said that the - there were several baggies where he - he had to look twice and he thought that they were bigger. And so he turned to his wife who helps him in the lab and he said, <span class="quote">'Am I, you know, crazy or are these enlarged?'</span> So I asked him - I try to qualify it with him - <span class="quote">'What do you mean enlarged? Like, are we talking 10, 20 percent?'</span> He said, <span class="quote">'No,'</span> he said, <span class="quote">'Dr. Ruby, they're - they're like two to three times larger.'</span> And I said, <span class="quote">'Well, what kind of timeframe are we talking about?'</span> And he said <span class="quote">'Several days.'</span> And like these were - these particular samples were in formalin. So the formulalin is not - which is a preservative for the audience's sake - this formalin is not discouraging the growth, it's not stopping it. So these, these, this information - I think Dr. Van Welbergen said that there's an intelligence - there's an intelligence to this graphene. It has a mission and it seems to be working when it's viewed under a microscope."</span> [13:20]</p>
<p>Then Jane Ruby talked about the video where ball bearings in castor oil assembled into wires, even though she claimed it showed self-assembling of graphene. And then Mike Adams said: <span class="quote">"Graphene is primarily made of carbon. And, and, so carbon is what we're seeing in a higher concentration in the clots compared to human blood."</span> [17:26]</p>
<p>Then Mike Adams said: <span class="quote">"That nanowire type of structure was embedded in the clot. It was not a contamination. It's not one of my own hairs, for example, that fell into the microscope. It was there, it was attached. And, you know, perhaps we could even, if we rehydrate that sample, we could look at the attachment point and get a little more detail on that. But you're right, at 1500 magnification, we were able to see these - what you might call nanowire interface structures - kind of like the edge of a circuit board, like an interface that you plug into your PC and it's got all these wires on the edge that talks to your CPU - it was like that was lining the top of this nanowire. And again, you and I are using these terms descriptively, we don't - we're not saying that for sure these are absolutely circuit boards, but that's what they resembled. So it's a mystery."</span> [23:18]</p>

</h3>
<p>In August 2022 Stew Peters Network published a video where Jane Ruby interviewed of Mike Adams, which they gave the title <span class="quote">"SHOCKING: White Embalmer Clots Are Self Assembling Circuits"</span>.</p>
<p>Mike Adams said: <span class="quote">"These clots are not made of blood, and they do not contain the elements that are common to human life. What they do contain in higher amounts - compared to human blood - are elements that you might find in circuitry or machinery, or electrically conductive systems."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1glsch-live-7pm-shocking-white-embalmer-clots-are-self-assembling-circuits.html?start=763>https://rumble.com/v1glsch-live-7pm-shocking-white-embalmer-clots-are-self-assembling-circuits.html?start=763</a>] Next he said that the clots are <span class="quote">"self-assembling machines"</span>: <span class="quote">"As you know, they are self-assembling biostructures. So they increase in size over time. And as they're increasing in size, they are accumulating - or harvesting from the blood - these electrically conductive elements that we've mentioned - tin, aluminum and sodium in particular. So in other words, these are self-assembling machines of some kind that are biologically, quote, <span class="quote">'compatible'</span> for a period of time."</span> [16:57]</p>
<p>Next Mike Adams speculated that in a similar fashion that an EMP weapon can destroy an electric circuit, the clots might make it possible to kill people with a directed energy weapon: <span class="quote">"We know that, you know - how EMP weapons work is they use an external electromagnetic field of very high energy in order to through induction cause intense heat in circuits to where those little tiny circuits melt, and then that circuit board fails. This is one of the ways that EMP weapons take out, you know, electronics circuit board control systems and so on. The question is, through the use of external electromagnetic fields or even DEW directed energy weapons, is it possible to induce very high heat in these clot structures because they have much higher levels of conductive elements? And is it possible then that these clots could be heated to cauterize the blood vessels, or to cook someone's blood vessels from the inside? And that would cause an instant blockage of blood flow, and that could also be directed at crowds or individuals potentially."</span> [25:12]</p>

</h3>
<p>In August 2022 Mike Adams published a video where he said: <span class="quote">"We noticed something really strange kind of alarming - and it's going to lead us down a deep, dark, Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole - and we noticed that some elements were higher in the clot than what they are in human blood. And three of those elements that are higher are sodium, tin, and aluminum. These three elements are all very good conductors of electricity, very good conductors of electricity."</span> [<a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-21-graphene-radio-frequency-electronics-biological.html>https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-21-graphene-radio-frequency-electronics-biological.html</a>, time 4:30]</p>
<p>And he said: <span class="quote">"Here's what's shocking, the clot is harvesting certain electrically conductive elements out of the blood and using those elements in its machinery - however you want to describe it - mechanism to assemble itself to grow its own size and mass, while concentrating electrically conductive elements into some form that we don't yet fully understand. So the shocking takeaway from this is that the clot is very, very low in elements that are associated with human life, but the clot is much higher in elements that would be associated with artificial life built by machines."</span> [6:31]</p>
<p>And next he said the clots may have utilized the kind of technology that Charles Lieber was working on, like <span class="quote">"nano-circuitary that is interfacing with biological systems and self-assembling inside the body and interfacing with cells and even inside the cell membranes for monitoring and control systems."</span> [9:00]</p>
<p>Next he said the clots may have acted in a similar manner as RFID tags, and he said: <span class="quote">"So what we know from RFID is that if you have a pattern of circuitry, it can respond to external electromagnetic, impulses or radiation. In addition, we know from studying EMP weapons and solar flares and so on, that circuits can be made very, very hot when there's enough external energy directed at them. In other words, the circuits kind of funneled the energy of the electromagnetic broadcast and it can create a lot of heat. And this is what fries the microcircuitry in devices during an EMP attack. There's too much voltage that is, well, inductive current that goes through the circuits, they get too hot and then they melt."</span> [12:27] And next he said the clots might similarly cause people to die from an EMP or a solar flare, and the clots would make possible to kill people remotely with directed energy weapons or 5G because the circuitry in the clots would generate so much heat.</p>
<p>He said: <span class="quote">"Well, what happens if those clots are heated by some external electromagnetic event, which again could be a solar flare - could be EMP weapon, could be a broadcast, you know, you start to ask questions - are 5G towers capable of this? What kind of broadcast systems could induce current and heat inside the clots? Well, at a certain point, a certain temperature in that clot, it's going to cook the blood vessel in which it resides."</span> [15:57]</p>
<p>He also said: <span class="quote">"There was a video, came out a while ago -and to this day, I don't know if that video was a hoax or something real - but it appeared to depict someone in Brazil who reportedly was vaccinated and was hit with one of these weapons and smoke - at least in this video, it may have been fake, we don't know if this is real - but in the video, smoke began to pour out of his eyeballs and his brain cooked from the inside. Now, I don't have that video. It appears to have been completely scrubbed off the internet, but I did see it."</span></p>
<p>Mike Adams didn't directly discuss graphene himself during the video, but Natural News published an article about the video by someone called Ethan Huff, who wrote: <span class="quote">"The 2014 study mentioned earlier discusses how graphene is used to create tiny circuit boards of microscopic size that enhance the conductivity and use of other metals. Could it be that Fauci Flu shots are self-assembling tiny circuit boards from metals siphoned from the blood, resulting in clots?"</span> [<a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-21-graphene-radio-frequency-electronics-biological.html>https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-21-graphene-radio-frequency-electronics-biological.html</a>]</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Elemental_composition_analysis_with_ICP_MS id=Elemental_composition_analysis_with_ICP_MS>Elemental composition analysis with ICP-MS</a>
</h3>
<p>Mike Adams is supposed to have analyzed the composition of a calamari clot sample with ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). In the original post about the ICP-MS results by Natural News, the results were split across multiple tables, carbon and calcium were missing, and the concentration of chlorine was erroneously shown as ppm instead of ppb.

<div>
<img src=i/clot-mike-table.png width=400>
</div>
<p>The only elements which differ by more than an order of magnitude between the clot and the control are magnesium, potassium, and iron, which are all more than an order of magnitude lower in the clot than in the control blood sample. Mike Adams noted the low levels of iron and potassium when he wrote: <span class="quote">"One conclusion is inescapable: The clot is almost entirely lacking key marker elements that would be present in human blood (such as iron and potassium) yet shows significantly higher concentrations of elements that are used in electronics and circuitry."</span></p>
<p>Mike Adams did not point out that his control sample had very high levels of tin and aluminum:</p>
<ul>
<li>A book about the toxicology of aluminum said: <span class="quote">"Normal levels of aluminum in serum are approximately 1-3 μg/L"</span> (i.e. 0.001-0.003 ppm). [<a href=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp22-c2.pdf>https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp22-c2.pdf</a>] A book chapter about aluminum toxicity says that <span class="quote">"serum levels above 200 µg/L are usually associated with clinical symptoms and signs of toxicity"</span>. [<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/aluminum-blood-level>https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/aluminum-blood-level</a>] But 200 µg/l is only 0.2 ppm, and Mike's control sample had about 8 times higher level of aluminum.</li>
<li>A paper I found said: <span class="quote">"Mean tin levels in non-exposed volunteers were 8.4 in blood and 1.0 μg L⁻¹ in urine."</span> [<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009912012005504>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009912012005504</a>] But 8.4 μg/L is 0.0084 ppm, and the level of tin was about 20 times higher in Mike's control sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the table below I included a column for a typical ppm level of each element in human blood, which which also shows how the control sample has an extremely high level of aluminum:</p>

<p>Another weird thing about the analysis by Mike Adams is that he is only supposed to have used one unvaccinated blood sample as a control. He could've at least taken the median of 3 samples or something, because his control sample might have had an unusual level of some elements. Or if his equipment was contaminated, he might have been able to detect it if he ran multiple control samples but they all got an unusually high level of some element, like aluminum or tin.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe Mike Adams accidentally reported the level of aluminum as 1.3 ppm even though it was supposed to be 1.3 ppb. But this table also shows that the level of aluminum was supposed to be about 1341 ppb in the control sample: [<a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-elemental-analysis-results-released-vaccine-clot-composition-not-blood-clots.html>https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-elemental-analysis-results-released-vaccine-clot-composition-not-blood-clots.html</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>The post in my previous link has links to PDFs which include the ICP-MS results of some additional elements that were missing from the table at Epoch Times. [<a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/files/CWC-Blood-Test-ICPMS-results.pdf>https://www.naturalnews.com/files/CWC-Blood-Test-ICPMS-results.pdf</a>, <a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/files/CWC-Clot-Test-ICPMS-results.pdf>https://www.naturalnews.com/files/CWC-Clot-Test-ICPMS-results.pdf</a>] I included the results from the PDFs in the next plots, which show that elements with a low typical ppm level in human plasma tend to have relatively high level in both Mike's clot sample and his control sample (which I thought might have been due to a limit of precision of the instrument, but ChatGPT said it was not likely and that contamination was a more likely explanation):</p>

<p>In the last plot above where Mike's control sample is compared against a typical ppm in human plasma, one thing that stands out is that the three elements which would typically be the most abundant in human plasma all have a relatively low level in Mike's control sample.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Analysis_of_Jane_Rubys_chemtrail_fog_by_Mike_Adams id=Analysis_of_Jane_Rubys_chemtrail_fog_by_Mike_Adams>Analysis of Jane Ruby's chemtrail fog by Mike Adams</a>
</h3>
<p>In 2022 after Jane Ruby asked Hirshcman to send his clots to Mike Adams, Mike Adams was the first person to publish the results of a laboratory analysis of the calamari clots. He looked at the clots under a microscope and he did an ICP-MS analysis of the clots where he found a high level of metals.</p>
<p>Three years later in 2025, Mike Adams said that Jane Ruby had sent him a sample that contained fallout from chemtrails and mystery fog. Ruby is supposed to have gathered the material on a sheet of plastic in her garden during a period where mysterious fog was observed in Florida. Mike Adams said that that he found a high level of metals in the sample with ICP-MS, and when he looked at the sample under a microscope, he also found <span class="quote">"biological life forms"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1907475744823107864>https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1907475744823107864</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fog-1.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Mike Adams also tweeted that people are being mass-poisoned by weaponized fog, and he posted a microscope photo of a blue fiber-like structure (which people on Twitter were saying was a Morgellons fiber): [<a href=https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1908402667396669751>https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1908402667396669751</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fog-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Mike Adams also wrote that he had found a structure in the chemtrail fog that had <span class="quote">"parallel lines that connect like circuitry"</span> (just like how in 2022 he was saying that the calamari clots contained electric circuits): [<a href=https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1907960000862892179>https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1907960000862892179</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fog-6.png width=500>
</div>
<p>A week later Mike Adams reported that he had now found early signs of life forming in Jane Ruby's chemtrail fog: [<a href=https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1910466399689941312>https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1910466399689941312</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fog-2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Mike Adams also published an ICP-MS analysis of the chemtrail fog similar to his ICP-MS analysis of the calamari clots: [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1916850734101942617>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1916850734101942617</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-rubychemtrail.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In 2017 Clifford Carnicom published a similar ICP-MS analysis of supposed Morgellons filaments from chemtrails, where he found a high level of aluminum, calcium, and iron. [<a href=https://carnicominstitute.org/environmental-filament-project-metals-testing-laboratory-report/>https://carnicominstitute.org/environmental-filament-project-metals-testing-laboratory-report/</a>] Later Carnicom became one of the first people after Mike Adams who presented a laboratory analysis of calamari clots.</p>

<p>Wayne Crouch is the <span class="quote">"head reporter"</span> at Australian National Review, which looks like an Aussie version of Stew Peters Network. But he also has his own SPN-style media outlet called Pure Media Australia, even though it has not been very successful.</p>
<p>The Rumble channel of Pure Media Australia features interviews of these people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelby Thompson from Foster Coulson's dating site Unjected, who also advertised a service at Unjected where people can purchase unvaccinated blood. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1h53zf-pure-media-australias-lisa-johnston-speaks-with-shelby-thompson-of-unjected.html?start=300>https://rumble.com/v1h53zf-pure-media-australias-lisa-johnston-speaks-with-shelby-thompson-of-unjected.html?start=300</a>] General Mike Flynn launched a similar dating site called 4thePURE, where people could also purchase unvaccinated sperm in addition to unvaccinated blood.</li>
<li>The Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee, whose story was first published by Project Veritas. She claimed that Pfizer vaccines contained luficerase, graphene oxide, and hydrogel.</li>
<li>The former Qtard Google whistleblower Zach Vorhies. He claimed that when he came out as a whistleblower on Project Veritas, he received the a text message signed <span class="quote">"~Q"</span> which said <span class="quote">"Do not worry, you have guardian angels watching over you."</span> [<a href=https://www.neonrevolt.com/2019/09/04/the-google-whistleblowers-message-from-qanon-greatawakening/>https://www.neonrevolt.com/2019/09/04/the-google-whistleblowers-message-from-qanon-greatawakening/</a>] In 2018, Vorhies was the main eyewitness who was interviewed by the media about the 2018 YouTube HQ shooting, but his story was full of inconsistencies, and for example in a part of his interview with ABC7 which was later omitted, he said that the shooter was a man who was dressed in gray even though actually the shooter was female. [<a href=https://burners.me/2019/09/04/something-strange-about-the-google-whistleblower/>https://burners.me/2019/09/04/something-strange-about-the-google-whistleblower/</a>]</li>
<li>Andrew Huff, who claims that he was able to use his GIS skills to detect the COVID outbreak in December 2019, because he saw an increase in PM 2.5 emissions over Wuhan so he knew that the crematoria in Wuhan were operating in overdrive. [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1873956650425762278>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1873956650425762278</a>] It was likely a lie inspired by the later story that there was a high level of sulphur dioxide over Wuhan due to burning of people who died from COVID, even though in reality it was due to persisent emissions by the Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Company.</li>
<li>The TikTok guy Randall Burton, who claims that he participated in a secret trial of an mRNA-based medication in 2013, where every participant out of over 200,000 participants had their heart stop, and less than five of them are still alive.</li>
<li>The Australian senator Malcolm Roberts, who is frequently reposted by Twitter bots that promote content from controlled alternative media, and that also promote people like Jim Ferguson, Craig Kelly, Peter Sweden, William Makis, James Melville, and David Cartland.</li>
<li>Richard Fleming, who claims that he got a PhD degree in particle physics at age 18, because he was part of a program that was a successor to MK-Ultra. [<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1876680552952004630>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1876680552952004630</a>] As evidence he presented a fake image of his diploma, which referred to a nonexistent executive order by JFK, where words were misspelled, and where images of seals were pasted in. [<a href=https://x.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1882133468500660348>https://x.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1882133468500660348</a>] In 2020 he faked a 7-country clinical trial of COVID treatments with 10 treatment arms and 1,800 patients, but the only authors in the paper about the trial were Fleming and his son.

<li>Shankara Chetty, who said that long COVID was caused by gut bacteria that were programmed by vaccines to produce snake venom, and who said that the snake venom guy Tau Braun was one of his guardian angels.</li>
<li>Todd Callender, who did a video with Jane Ruby where he said that calamari clots are 5G antennas.</li>
<li>Elon Musk's father Errol Musk (whose oldest interview on BitChute was done by Wayne Crouch).</li>
<li>David Icke, who in 2020 was one of the first big names in alt media apart from flat earthers who started to say that viruses are not real.</li>
<li>Astrid Stuckelberger, who said that COVID vaccines contain hydras, and that there was a special access program at CERN where beings from 17 dimensions were coming in and out of portals.</li>
<li>The DMED whistleblower Pete Chambers, who was featured in the Died Suddenly movie together with the DMED whistleblower Theresa Long. During the interview when Pete Chambers described his background, he said: <span class="quote">"So, being in Special Forces, in the Green Berets, is - our specialty's unconventional warfare, foreign and internal defense, direct action, weapons of mass destruction, those types of things. The biologic warfare falls in that category as well. Uh, but it puts me in - right in the front seat of uh, doing what we call, said, unconventional warfare, which - it has a heavy piece of psychological, psyops, or information operations, those kinds of things. So that's what uh - so they understand my background, it's just, I've done some of it for real, down the range, yeah."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4uhu30-lt-colnel-dr-peter-chambers-warns-of-possible-future-biological-event%2e.html?start=135>https://rumble.com/v4uhu30-lt-colnel-dr-peter-chambers-warns-of-possible-future-biological-event%2e.html?start=135</a>]</li>
<li>Andrew Zywiec, who was credited in an Unholy Triad, and who did videos in 2024 where he presented Greg Harrison's mass spectrometry results of calamari clots.</li>
<li>Daniel Santiago, who provided an AI-generated document about fake ORFs to Philip McMillan, and who is on the editorial board of the fake journal IJVTPR.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pmaguests.webp width=1400>

<hr />
<p>After every article on the website of Pure Media Australia, there's this meme-style image that features Shankara Chetty: [<a href=https://puremediaaustralia.org/f/global-conspiracy-exposed-unveiling-the-ultimate-bioweapon>https://puremediaaustralia.org/f/global-conspiracy-exposed-unveiling-the-ultimate-bioweapon</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-chettypma.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>Shankara Chetty is the sidekick of McMillan, but McMillan promoted An Unholy Triad and the story about the fake ORFs. Chetty says that long COVID is caused by gut bacteria that have been programmed by vaccines to produce snake venom. Chetty's theory was discussed by Bryan Ardis in Watch the Water 2. Chetty also said that the counterterrorism expert Tau Braun was one of his guardian angels, and that Tau Braun told him to keep an eye on snake venom (but Tau Braun says that calamari clots are made up of tissue that was programmed to grow venom glands by nanobots that used graphene oxide as the delivery mechanism).</p>
<hr />
<p>The Twitter user Sudden and Unexpected posted a TikTok video where some guy called Randall Burton said: <span class="quote">"See, back in early 2013, I participated in mRNA-based immunomodulatory medication trial. So, yeah, a medical trial on an mRNA-based medication that was meant to alter how the T-cells produced antibodies. And it worked phenomenally for not just lupus, but also for colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis as well. Here's the kicker. Out of that trial, there were over 200,000 participants. And every last one of us, including myself, had their heart stop. There's less than five of us that are still alive today, but all of us experienced our heart stopping at least once. According to my doctor, less than five of us are still alive."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/toobaffled/status/1911863358619525234>https://x.com/toobaffled/status/1911863358619525234</a>]</p>

<p>Then Wayne Crouch replied: <span class="quote">"This is my mate, his name is Randell and yes this is what happened to him he has been gutted like a fish almost and tossed back together, he was lucky to have survived the ordeal and likely the only victim that actually is left alive talking. I know the full details as to who did what to him or as full as he could give to me and I can tell you right now he is not a liar, even after all the threats and back lash he still tries to save people from going through what he has half the attacks are likely paid for by big pharma the rest are so bloody wrong and out of touch with reality it just ain't funny."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1911971108947153391>https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1911971108947153391</a>]</p>

<a href=#Daniel_Santiago id=Daniel_Santiago>Daniel Santiago</a>
</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if Daniel Santiago is a member of Solution of Scientists, but he promoted the same ORF hoax as members of SOS, and he was listed in the credits of the Unholy Triad videos, and he was featured in Maria Zeee's clot panel together with Hirschman, Greg Harrison, and Wayne Crouch.</p>
<p>The only scientific paper about the calamari clots I have found is a paper by Daniel Santiago and John W. Oller from 2023 titled <span class="quote">"Abnormal Clots and All-Cause Mortality During the Pandemic Experiment: Five Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Are Evidently Lethal to Nearly All Medicare Participants"</span> (if I use a very loose definition of a scientific paper that includes nonscientific papers masquerading as scientific papers): <a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/73.><a href="https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/73" class="uri">https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/73</a>.</a> John W. Oller is the editor in chief of the journal IJVTPR which published the paper, and Daniel Santiago is also included on the editorial board of the journal. A common pattern with the papers published by IJVTPR is that one or more of the authors are members of the editorial board.</p>
<p>The paper by Santiago and Oller has a long introduction section that talks about the clots, even though the results section describes an analysis of mortality statistics that doesn't have anything to do with the clots.</p>
<p>A great sign of the quality of the paper is that it cites clowns like Daniel Broudy, Pablo Campra, J.J. Couey, Edward Dowd, Richard Fleming, David Hughes, Steve Kirsch, Valerie Kyrie, Sasha Latypova, Ricardo Delgado Martin, David Nixon, Jean-Claude Perez, Samir Saidi, and Shimon Yanowitz.</p>
<p>This is how Santiago and Oller proved that vaccines kill people through combinatory logic (generalizing from proofs by the mathematician Gregory Chaitin): <span class="quote">"In the instance of the synthetic XNA coding for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, every instance introduced in, say, the Pfizer BNT162b2 injectable, is supposed to consist of an exact replica of a string of pseudo-codons pretending to be ordinary self-produced mRNA authored by the body's native nuclear DNA. In that respect each one of them is a lie to begin with. The SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, pretending to belong inside the cells, tissues, and organ systems of any human body is already a lie before it is transformed into any genetically modified XNA. However, when it is transformed into its XNA shape, coding for the 1273 amino acids of just the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, it is modified to contain many additional lies embedded within itself. By simple combinatory logic we can show why those lies, billions of them in each dose of every genetically engineered injectable (Pfizer 13.1 billion, Moderna 13.1 billion, AstraZeneca 50 billion; according to Fleming, 2021, p. 99), must tend to increase exponentially over time into a multitude of multitudes of lies that rapidly reach a level of irreducible complexity (generalizing from proofs by Gregory Chaitin, 2004, 2007). Unless all of those lies can be expunged, corrected, or at least quarantined and ignored by the body's biosignaling systems, they must lead toward disorders, diseases, and the eventual catastrophic breakdown of the body's biosignaling systems which is death."</span></p>
<p>Apart from Daniel Santiago and John W. Oller, other members of the editorial board of IJVTPR include Daniel Broudy and Shimon Yanowitz. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>] In 2022 Yanowitz told Sasha Latypova that when he looked at his blood under a microscope, he found a synthetic fiber that may have been a Morgellons fiber, and that looked very mean and that made red blood cells nervous, and he also said that he found strange objects in his blood that looked like dinosaurs and missiles.

<p>IJVTPR is the journal that published the infamous nanobot paper in 2024 by Daniel Broudy and Youngmi Lee. [<a href=pfizerstew.html#Paper_about_nanotechnology_in_COVID_vaccines_by_Young_Mi_Lee_and_Daniel_Broudy>pfizerstew.html#Paper_about_nanotechnology_in_COVID_vaccines_by_Young_Mi_Lee_and_Daniel_Broudy</a>] And IJVTPR has published three other papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines by Daniel Broudy, David Hughes, and Valerie Kyrie, who all have a background in psychology or propaganda research, and who all write for a website called Propaganda in Focus. Valerie Kyrie's bio says that she works <span class="quote">"in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that <span class="quote">"her doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49</a>] Daniel Broudy has a doctorate degree in applied psycholinguistics and he used to work in military intelligence, and his bio says: <span class="quote">"My work integrates research in linguistics, psychology, and communication theory to describe ways in which power centers design and conduct propaganda campaigns."</span> [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Broudy>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Broudy</a>] The bio of David Hughes says that he lectures in security studies and that his areas of research include psychological warfare and <span class="quote">"the class relations behind psychological operations"</span>. [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 IJVTPR published a paper by David Hughes, where he compiled microscope images published by various researchers who suggested that vaccines contained microchips, hydras, Morgellons fibers, nanoantennas, motherboards, graphene oxide razor blades, carbon nanotubes, nano-octopuses, mesospores, SIM cards, <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> parasites, hydrogel, microbubbles, long stick-like organisms, parasites attached to magnets, eggs that were hatching new structures, geometric structures that lit up when a mobile phone was used nearby, dark crystals, microelectric circuitry, and so on, and he wrote that the researchers must be onto something because <span class="quote">"at least 26 different investigations of the <span class="quote">'vaccine'</span> contents (almost entirely unrelated to one another) from 16 different countries on five continents converge on remarkably similar findings"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288</a>]</p>
<p>A few days after IJVTPR published the paper by David Hughes, they published a response to the paper by Daniel Santiago. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/56>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/56</a>] Santiago had little negative to say about the paper, and he didn't question if the vaccines contain structures like hydras or motherboards. But instead Santiago just said that vaccines didn't contain nitrogen or phosphorous, which he presented as evidence that vaccines did not contain DNA or RNA but instead they contained <span class="quote">"XNA"</span> (xeno nucleic acids), and he wrote that vaccines contained <span class="quote">"intentionally manufactured self-assembling components, built mainly from carbon-based materials used in computing and super-conductors"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is missing from the spectral analyses of the foreign elements in the main COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna for certain, and probably also missing from the other experimental products being widely distributed that are known to contain foreign aggregates of strange materials similar to those found in the Moderna and Pfizer injections, are the elements nitrogen and phosphorous. This is revealing because all natural DNA, RNA, and their protein products contain those missing elements. Nitrogen for protein synthesis and phosphorus for DNA, RNA, and energy transfer. Therefore, their absence from the foreign structures seen under many different microscopes in all of the COVID-19 so-called <span class="quote">"vaccines"</span> that have been examined, and also found in blood samples of persons injected with the Moderna and Pfizer concoctions, proves that these intentionally manufactured self-assembling components, built mainly from carbon-based materials used in computing and super-conductors, are connected with the avant-guard evolutionary theory and experimentation with what is known as XNA, Xeno (Greek for <span class="quote">"foreign"</span>), Nucleic Acid. Most of the relevant information is behind significant paywalls in esoteric journals specializing in this peculiar branch of highly theoretical and experimental chemistry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel Santiago has 8 works listed at Orcid, but 6 of them were published by IJVTPR and the remaining 2 works are preprints. [<a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5975-0592>https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5975-0592</a>]</p>
<p>In 2024 Santiago and 4 other editors of IJVTPR wrote a response to a critique of a paper published in IJVTPR. The other editors included Shimon Yanowitz and the former military intelligence agent Daniel Broudy. They wrote: [<a href=https://mail.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/114>https://mail.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/114</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 injectables contain at least 55 undeclared chemical elements including so-called <span class="quote">"rare earth"</span> metals and 12 of the 15 lanthanides. The likelihood that such elements are not involved in self-assembling entities in the fluids and in the unnatural clots in many recipients is zero. Ongoing gain-of-function bioweapons research together with published agendas for population reduction and control suggest that military-grade nanotechnologies are at play in the world-wide COVID-19 experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IJVTPR has now deleted the paper which Santiago and other editors of IJVTPR defended, but it was mirrored here: <a href=https://rdi.uncoma.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/uncomaid/18277/21102024%2BDiblasi%2Bet%2Bal_ICP-MS_05092024.pdf.><a href="https://rdi.uncoma.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/uncomaid/18277/21102024%2BDiblasi%2Bet%2Bal_ICP-MS_05092024.pdf" class="uri">https://rdi.uncoma.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/uncomaid/18277/21102024%2BDiblasi%2Bet%2Bal_ICP-MS_05092024.pdf</a>.</a> The authors of the paper wrote that the vaccine samples contained a high amount of lanthanides (which are elements with an atomic number in the range of 57 to 70), which the authors presented as evidence that vaccines contained nanotechnology: <span class="quote">"Because the lanthanides, as we have noted above, are known to be extremely cytotoxic (Voncken, 2016; Balaram, 2019), their being discovered in significant quantity, and across the whole array of vaccines we have studies here, is suggestive of some kind of nanotechnological experimentation along the lines being discussed by Kyrie &amp; Broudy (2022), Lee and Broudy (2024a), Hughes (2024), and others."</span> The papers by Kyrie, Broudy, and Hughes the authors cited were all papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines that were published by IJVTPR.</p>
<p>The paper that Santiago defended was so fake that even Mike Adams wrote it was a hoax: <span class="quote">"The study is a hoax. The ICP-MS instrument can't detect <span class="quote">'chemicals'</span> in the first place. The reported numbers for many elements are far beyond the sensitivity capabilities of the instrument.

<p>In 2024 a large number of Twitter accounts posted a clip of a video where Andrew Zywiec described mass spec results of the calamari clots, and he also said that the clots had a high level of tin and sulphur: [<a href=https://fixupx.com/SenseReceptor/status/1811847665573068883>https://fixupx.com/SenseReceptor/status/1811847665573068883</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-zywiec.png width=500>
</div>
<p>However in the video Zywiec was just talking about the same results that have been presented by Greg Harrison and Tom Haviland, so I don't know if Zywiec had personally analyzed the clots or if he just reported on the resuls of analysis done by other people.</p>
<p>Zywiec was listed as a member of the <span class="quote">"scientific research and advisory team"</span> of An Unholy Triad. Wayne Crouch wrote <span class="quote">"I personally know and work with <span class="citation" data-cites="AndrewZywiecMD">@AndrewZywiecMD</span> he is a member of our scientific research team"</span>.

</h3>
<p>In June 2024 Andrew Zywiec and Daniel Santiago were guests on a Rumble channel called Vaxxchoice.</p>
<p>During the video Zywiec talked about Santiago's nonsensical <span class="quote">"quantum codon energetics"</span> theory: <span class="quote">"Now, theoretically, though, when you look at the - when you look at the quantum energetics of bonding, these things should not be the same thing, right. […] That's called a wobble base pair, that third base pair that changes, and you can change it and wind up with the same amino acid. But energetically, it perhaps is not the same amino acid when it comes down to the quantum energetics."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v52qksk-in-the-lions-den-spike-proteins-created-by-the-mrna.html?start=1872>https://rumble.com/v52qksk-in-the-lions-den-spike-proteins-created-by-the-mrna.html?start=1872</a>]</p>
<p>Andrew Zywiec also showed Greg Harrison's HPLC-MS results and he said: <span class="quote">"Now when you look at the actual structure of these clots though, they're not normal. Number one, they're not adhered to the vascular membrane, right, so you're not seeing them anchored to the von Villebrand, and anchored into the endothelial matrix. Whhich is interesting in and of itself. But furthermore you expect the clots to be majorly formed of a protein called fibrin. Fibrin is the end of the coagulation cascade, essentially. Now, that's not happening. We have very little fibrin, almost none, right. We also have no thrombin, which is what creates fibrin, essentially, at an enzymatic level. We don't see any thrombin. What we do see is tons of fibrinogen, which is a precursor to fibrin. So that shows you that these are not - the coagulation cascade is not working properly. It's working very strangely."</span> [47:18]</p>
<p>However if he would've simply asked ChatGPT why the HPLC-MS results don't include fibrin but only fibrinogen, it would've answered it's because HPLC-MS detects fragments of proteins but not not whole fibrin protein, so it detects fragments of the fibrinogen proteins that make up each fibrin unit but not the fibrin itself. Why did neither Zywiec or Harrison or anyone else in their team figure it out? Greg Harrison said that their HPLC-MS analysis was done by an unnamed PhD student who studied for a degree in protein chemistry, so the student could've probably also looked up why fibrin was not listed in the results, or they should've known it even without looking it up.</p>
<p>(Even though I think it's more likely that Greg made up the story about the PhD student and he just generated fake the mass spectrometry results with AI, because he was not able to publish the raw data of his results, or even publish a detailed table of his results. When I asked an LLM to generate fake HPLC-MS results of fibrin clots that showed the percentage of each protein, it created somewhat similar list of percentages that were shown by Harrison and Zywiec, and it also didn't include fibrin in the results. But at first I didn't understand why fibrin was missing from the results myself either, so it seems plausible that Greg Harrison's crew came up with the story that the missing fibrin was anomalous because they misinterpreted their own fake data.)</p>
<p>Zywiec also said that the clots are not attached to the vascular membrane. But then why did John O'Looney claim that he didn't see calamari clots until June 2022, because the clots were not pushed along with the blood when the embalming fluid was inserted?</p>

The description of the interview said: <span class="quote">"On today's Dr. Jane Ruby Show, Dr. Jane interviews Counter-bioterrorism expert Dr. Tau Braun who explains that self-replicating nanoparticles in the C19 shots are programmed to grow venom ducts inside the human body.

<p>Tau Braun said that people were wondering if COVID vaccines contain snake venom or if they contain graphene oxide, but he said they contain both because the graphene oxide acts as a delivery mechanism for the snake venom. At time 13:18, he said: <span class="quote">"How do you get venom into the body and how do you keep it stable? You add graphene oxide."</span></p>
<p>At time 40:33, Tau Braun said that the calamari clots consist of tissue which contains snake venom ducts: <span class="quote">"Those monstrous clot-looking things are literally tissue that has grown a duct - and specialized ducts - the closest match I found to these fibrotic clots today is the chameleon tongue - it's the long, very very - extremely - it has what's called the tensile strength, it has elasticity to it. But it's extremely strong. Cause it has to whip out like a whip and it has to come back in, and so it has to have expansion at rapid speed, and it has to be able to go back. So it's like elastic."</span></p>
<p>At time 17:40, Tau Braun said that if there is a species of snake that eats rodents, then the snake won't produce venom which affects amphibians but only venom which affects rodents, and in the same way the snake venom in the COVID vaccines was designed to not affect Aryans because the COVID vaccines are a race-specific bioweapon that was created by the Fourth Reich: <span class="quote">"So why are certain people totally fine from this? I'm gonna tell you that this was built by the Fourth Reich, and I'm gonna tell you that Aryans are not having a problem with this vaccine. I'm gonna tell you that you can stick this into an Aryan over and over. And what I mean by Aryan? I mean people that originally came from Viking heritage, Germanic heritage, and that basically you can go and look at those principles of what Nazis believe the superior race to be. And I'm gonna tell you this weapon was not built for them."</span> Tau Braun also said that the Aryans were planning to kill off nine tenths of humanity.</p>

They're telling you, you should go look for. So I can actually answer everything about the blood clots with snake venom research publications right now to both of you. And you, Mike, if you're getting a laser thing that can identify materials, it would help us identify these proteins that they are using to create fibrous blood clots from two proteins, from two different snake venoms. They know they can make it resistant to being breakdown. I can't believe it. It's insane."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v261tp4-must-watch-mike-adams-and-dr.-bryan-ardis-break-new-ground-clots-venom-and-.html?start=479>https://rumble.com/v261tp4-must-watch-mike-adams-and-dr.-bryan-ardis-break-new-ground-clots-venom-and-.html?start=479</a>]</p>
<p>Next Ardis pointed out how blood clots in COVID patients were resistent to heparin, and showed a paper titled <span class="quote">"Nanofibrous Snake Venom Hemostat"</span>, which said <span class="quote">"Patients on anticoagulant therapy such as heparin have diminished clotting potential and are at risk for hemorrhaging. Here we describe a self-assembling nanofibrous peptide hydrogel turned SLac that on its own can act as a physical barrier to blood loss. SLac was loaded with snake-venom derived Batroxobin (50 g/mL) yielding a drug-loaded hydrogel (SB50). SB50 was potentiated to enhance clotting even in the presence of heparin."</span> [18:59] And he showed an image from the paper where snake venom hydrogel was applied to a cut to stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Next Ardis showed an article about a product for sealing wounds, which consisted of a hydrogel formulation with two proteins from snake venom called ecarin and textilin. [<a href=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/made-from-snake-venom-these-hydrogels-could-treat-uncontrolled-bleeding-180980295/>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/made-from-snake-venom-these-hydrogels-could-treat-uncontrolled-bleeding-180980295/</a>] The article said that <span class="quote">"The gel is also thermo-responsive, so it is in liquid form when stored in a cool place but will solidify at body temperature to seal the wound"</span>, which Ardis suggested might have explained why COVID vaccines had to be stored at a cold temperature.</p>
<p>Next Ardis said that the formation of clots induced by snake venom could be prevented by glycericin, and Mike Adams said: <span class="quote">"And so, I mean, you really just nailed something huge here. I wasn't aware that licorice root glycericin could stop the binding of these venoms to the fibrinogen receptors. That is - that is huge."</span> [34:35]</p>
<p>Then Ardis said that the blood of vaccinated people should be analyzed to see if the snake venom proteins ecarin and textilin can be isolated from the blood, because <span class="quote">"If that's in the vaccinated people, they're injecting snake venom infused hydrogels to elicit blood clotting."</span> [36:02]</p>
<p>Near the end of the interview Mike Adams said: <span class="quote">"I truly believe based on - on your research and what you've presented - I believe that the mRNA sequences contain, uh, venom peptide sequences as part of the overall picture."</span> [44:35]</p>

<p>In September 2021 Carrie Madej started to say that COVID vaccines contained eggs of transgenic parasites of the species <em>Hydra vulgaris</em>. In 2021 before the story about the calamari clots had been rolled out, Carrie Madej told Stew Peters that vaccinated people were growing hydra clots: [<a href=https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/>https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/</a>]</p>

<p>Carrie Madej told Stew: <span class="quote">"Let's just look at these water parasites. These things have the potential to grow, and be innumerable, right. If you're growing things, it has the potential to clog your arteries, it can clog capillaries, it can clog lymphatics.

<p>However the hydra clot was actually a clot from the lungs of a heart failure patient from 2018: [<a href=https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/>https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/</a>]</p>

<p>In 2021 Resistance GB did one interview with John O'Looney and another interview with a British funeral director named Wesley who seems to have later been forgotten (even though I don't know if he was actually a funeral director or if he was just an actor playing a role):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-redpilled-funeral.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Wesley said that around the time when people in younger age groups got vaccinated, he had about 2 to 3 times the normal number of funerals, and all of them were people in their 40s or younger, there were no longer any elderly people dying because the elderly people who were going to die in the next year or year and half had already died when the vaccines were rolled out to older age groups. He said: <span class="quote">"So this year, as the vaccinations have gone on, I've seen trends through the age groups. Obviously, it's not marked down that they're vaccinated. But to have the most funerals that you've ever done in two weeks, and they're all aged 30, 40, no older. […] That's what I saw earlier in the year, when that age group got vaccinated. […] Well you always usually deal with all different age groups, but as I was saying, the elderly that were probably gonna go in the next year - or year and a half or whatever - they've already gone. So, there's a big gap there. So we weren't having those deaths anymore. And, with younger people, they're now vaccinated, and I had about 12 in one go. […] We normally have about 4 or 5 funerals going, not 12 - 11 or 12 - and not all of that age group. There would be old people in there. And then now it's quiet. And what I've seen is a lot of newborn babies in the fridges in the mortuaries."</span> [<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;ResistanceGB/funeral-director-babies>https://odysee.com/@ResistanceGB/funeral-director-babies</a>, time 1:16; transcript at <a href=https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/>https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/</a>]</p>
<p>It's not clear if he meant that all people who died were in their 40s but not older or that all people were aged 40 but not older (or if by all people he meant nearly all people). But in any case his anecdotal statistics are inconsistent with actual mortality statistics in England, where in May to June 2021 when the highest number of people in their 30s and 40s got vaccinated, only about 5% of all deaths were in ages 0-49: [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/1343dailydeathsbydateofoccurrence1stjune2014to31stmay2023bysingleyearofageengland>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/1343dailydeathsbydateofoccurrence1stjune2014to31stmay2023bysingleyearofageengland</a>]</p>

<p>At time 4:16 when Wesley was asked what causes of death he saw written down on the death certificates, he answered: <span class="quote">"There's a lot of myocarditis, myocardial infarction - it's all blood, heart-based - pneumonia - but COVID, I've only had one this year. One COVID death written down since January."</span> But according to Nomis about 12% of all deaths in England in 2021 had the underlying cause COVID: [<a href=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/161.1/advanced.aspx>https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/161.1/advanced.aspx</a>]</p>

<p>A common trope among alt media morticians is that they have a dramatic story to tell about dead babies. At time 2:57 Wesley also said there were about ten times more babies dying than normally, so there was no more room in the fridge for babies so the dead babies had to be placed in an adult fridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, do you want to talk about the number of newborn babies that you've seen in the morgue?<br> <strong>Wesley:</strong> Oh, they're really high. They're up at about 13 in one hospital.<br> <strong>Interviewer:</strong> And how many would they usually have?<br> <strong>Wesley:</strong> They have fridges that will hold about 6 to 10 maximum. And they're never normally full. But now, they're on in the adult section. <strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, there's about maybe ten times the rate, wouldn't you say?<br> <strong>Wesley:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. And obviously they're either miscarried or full-term stillbirths, but not a lot's been said about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However based on this plot, the stillbirth rate in England and Wales was not particularly high in 2021: [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2022>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2022</a>]</p>
<div>

<p>Wesley didn't say anything about a new type of white clots during his interview. I only found one other video by Wesley, which was a short video from December 2021 where he said that the pandemic was fake, but he didn't mention a new type of white clots in the other video either.

<li>The story about the DMED data was first presented by Tom Renz in Ron Johnson's panel on January 24th 2022, and two days later the story about the calamari clots was first presented by Hirschman on January 26th 2022 on the Jane Ruby Show. Jane Ruby also did a show about the DMED data on January 28th, and the same day she went on Stew's show to discuss both the clots and the DMED data.

<li>The Died Suddenly movie featured a long segment where the DMED whistleblowers Theresa Long and Pete Chambers discussed the DMED data. Long and Chambers are both medical officers in the US Air Force. Tom Haviland is also a retired Major General in the US Air Force. And the embalmer Laura Jeffrey who helped Haviland run one of his surveys was trained in the Air Force cadets, even though I don't know if she later served in the Air Force.

<li>Todd Callender is a lawyer who worked with the DMED whistleblowers, but came up with a theory that the calamari clots are 5G antennas. Todd Callender and Theresa Long were saying that people were getting burn rings on the top of their head because people were being tracked by GPS. Callender was also credited in An Unholy Triad.</li>
<li>Soon after Tom Renz had presented the DMED data in Ron Johnson's panel, an interview with Renz was published by Daniel Horowitz. Many of the earliest tweets about the DMED data linked to the article by Horowitz. Horowitz was also the third person after Jane Ruby and Steve Kirsch who interviewed Hirschman, and he has interviewed many other people about the clots. He also published photos and videos of clots which he claimed were sent to him by unnamed embalmers but which I didn't find published elsewhere earlier.</li>

<p>I believe Horowitz was also the third person who interviewed Hirschman after Jane Ruby and Steve Kirsch. During the interview Horowitz told Hirschman: <span class="quote">"You've done previous interviews with Steve Kirsch, Stew Peters, Jane Ruby.

<p>Jane Ruby said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"But the point of the story is, Mike Adams did an incredible analysis when he magnified at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times - he did see what looked like circuitry. We still don't know 100% what the chemical composition is, but we know that it was all metallic, and very rare metals that are not usually found in humans. So I want to put that together with our discussion, not to throw in just for the fun of it, but so that we can start to tie it together with what you have found."</span> [13:10] Then Todd Callender said that he independently came to the same conclusion as Mike Adams, and the clots did in fact contain metals, and the metals acted as 5G antennas. And he said that ultimately the clots turned humans into cloud computing nodes that had interoperability with the 5G system.</p>
<p>Later Todd Callender said: <span class="quote">"And, so this has been further corroborated by Dr. Theresa Long. She's one of my affiants. You and her both have given expert testimony in my case where we asked - we filed it in the US Supreme Court, by the way, and - and what she came to observe after we started - you know, kind drilling down on this - is that she noticed that a lot of the people on her post and other places had these weird rings on the top of their heads. And as we started to dig into this, the, the hackers were - or the paper about the hackers was saying - that because these people were being tracked too much - because the hackers were tracking too many people - it had a deleterious effect on people's bodies, as seen by, as indicated by the top of their heads, the GPS causing irritation."</span> [23:26] And Callender said: <span class="quote">"It's the crown, the crown of the head is how she describes this. They bought us coronavirus. Corona is Spanish or Latin for crown. And so it makes perfect sense."</span> And Jane Ruby asked: <span class="quote">"And Dr. Long is seeing this in military patients that she's examining?"</span> And Callender answered yes.</p>
<p>Often electomagnetic waves are depicted as concentric rings or arcs, like in symbols that depict Wi-Fi or cell towers, even though it doesn't actually mean that the intensity of the electromagnetic waves relative to the midpoint of the receiving or transmitting device would form rings that would have some stronger layers and some weaker layers.</p>
<p>And anyway the way GPS works is that satellites transmit a GPS signal that is picked up by a passive receiver, so people are exposed to the signal from GPS satellites even if there's no GPS receiver inside their body to pick up the signal. And even if there was a GPS receiver inside the head, the part of the head directly above the receiver would be exposed to a similar amount of electromagnetic radiation from GPS satellites as the rest of the head.</p>
<p>In an interview with Lee Merritt, Todd Callender said that the calamari clots are amyloid antennas: <span class="quote">"And I talked to the guy that was yanking these out of bodies, by the way, and others who tested them. And they're amyloid! And so, we went back and we figured out what is it, and they're actually the antenna part of our bodies that are hooked into the 5G network, bind to our wireless body area network. They're amyloid antennas! That's what they are! And as our body gets transformed into this synthetic version, you know, some blood flow goes past, some people surviving, some people don't."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v45696i-dr.-merritt-and-attorney-todd-calendar-on-the-enemy-within.html?start=2417>https://rumble.com/v45696i-dr.-merritt-and-attorney-todd-calendar-on-the-enemy-within.html?start=2417</a>] Then Lee Merritt asked: <span class="quote">"So you don't think that's the hydra in that white stuff?"</span> And Callender answered: <span class="quote">"I think it's for sure. […] But sure, I think that hydras have actually been found. And those creatures, they're not regular biology either as I understand. They're effectively an alien species."</span></p>
<p>The earliest tweet I found which said that dental anesthetic contained hydrogel was posted in February 2023 by some Qtard account, and it said: <span class="quote">"Jane Ruby and attorney Todd Callender confirm that ALL INJECTABLES contain DARPA HYDROGEL, flue shots , vxxxines and even dental anesthesia …."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>In April 2025 the calamari clots were back in the news, and articles about the clots that were based on a Substack post by Tom Haviland were published by several fake news sites, including Expose News, The People's Voice, Slay News, and Natural News.

<p>The article by The People's Voice also featured this video titled <span class="quote">"Japan Warns Hearts of 6 Billion Vaxxxed Set to Explode in Global Catastrophe"</span>:</p>

<p>The author of the article by Slay News was listed as Frank Bergman.

<p>Around the same time videos of Greg Harrison and Tom Haviland were also posted by Sense Receptor and Jim Ferguson: [<a href=https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1909741957942771987>https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1909741957942771987</a>, <a href=https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1909894887287185618>https://x.com/JimFergusonUK/status/1909894887287185618</a>]</p>

<p>Sudden and Unexpected, Sense Receptor, and Jim Ferguson all post the same type of video clips from controlled alt media, and they all promote fake news sites like The People's Voice, Slay News, and Expose News. All three accounts are also promoted by the same type of bot accounts.</p>
<p>In 2024 I scraped the reposts of about 80 accounts that I suspected to be bots that promoted content from the controlled alt media. When I picked COVID-related accounts reposted by the suspected bots and I divided the number of reposts by the number of followers of each account, Sense Receptor ranked 5th highest, Sudden and Unexpected ranked 7th highest, and Jim Ferguson ranked 15th highest: [<a href=bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers>bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers</a>]</p>

</h3>
<p>In the previous section where the accounts are sorted by the ratio of reposts by suspected bots relative to followers, the account mariusknulst ranks first and sophiadahl1 ranks third. They are both portrayed as accounts of the same Norwegian lady, but I suspect they are actually bots. [<a href=bot2.html#sophiadahl1_and_mariusknulst>bot2.html#sophiadahl1_and_mariusknulst</a>]</p>
<p>sophiadahl1 often retweets random tweets in languages like Turkish and Portuguese, which Norwegians is unlikely to understand:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-5.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>Later when I checked the most recent tweets by SophiaDahl1 again, within the 10 hours it had retweeted a tweet about flat earth, it had retweeted tweets in Turkish, German, Hindi, and Chinese, and it had retweeted accounts which quoted one of its tweets and commented on the tweet in Turkish, Bosnian, Finnish, Swedish, and Dutch, and it had retweeted an AI-generated image of Elon Musk that was posted by an Elon Musk fan account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-7.jpg width=1400>
</div>
<p>The image below shows two variants of the same tweet that were posted by sophiadahl1 about one month apart. The tweets look like they might be generated by AI based on some template so that it humanized the text by introducing a certain number of errors to the template, so that it doesn't look like grammatically perfect text that was generated by AI but it looks like text that was written by a crazy person. The text I added in red shows that the older tweet included one error that was missing from the newer tweet, but the newer tweet included three errors that were missing from the older tweet (which wouldn't make sense if the new tweet was written by a human who edited the old tweet to fix errors): [<a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1808009492262510961>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1808009492262510961</a>, <a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1822181811012722858>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1822181811012722858</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-8.png width=1000>
</div>
<p>Later when sophiadahl1 posted a similar tweet yet again, there were more errors introduced to the tweet that were missing from both earlier versions, like that the word <span class="quote">"fuellmich"</span> was written in lowercase, and there were two superfluous spaces before punctuation characters. [<a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1910948406752665726>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1910948406752665726</a>]</p>
<p>sophiadahl1 also promotes flat earth:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-dahl-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Here sophiadahl1 promoted a video about the clots by Peak Prosperity, but similar tweets had been posted earlier by accounts called JaneBond (backup) and Project TABS:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-bot-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>This tweet about the clots by sophiadahl1 had also been posted earlier by JaneBond (backup)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-bot-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Below sophiadahl1 posted a video about calamari clots by Kla.TV, which is conspiracy video site that is ran by a Swiss cult that has connections to Scientology. [<a href=turbo.html#KLA_tv_and_connection_of_Scientology_to_the_German_medical_freedom_movement>turbo.html#KLA_tv_and_connection_of_Scientology_to_the_German_medical_freedom_movement</a>] Similar tweets had been posted by JaneBond (backup), and by Sudden and Unexpected which is reposted by the same type of bots that repost sophiadahl1: [<a href=https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1846357133161316535>https://x.com/sophiadahl1/status/1846357133161316535</a>]</p>

<img src=i/clot-bot-6.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I found a Vietnamese bot called Dungpikachu that mainly promotes a cryptocurrency called Pi. It often also promotes Elon Musk and Trump, and it also posts about Qanon. One time it quoted a tweet about calamari clots by another similar Vietnamese bot called SmolfSmolf7, which also promotes the cryptocurrency Pi, Trump, Elon Musk, and Qanon: [<a href=https://x.com/Dungpikachu>https://x.com/Dungpikachu</a>, <a href=https://x.com/SmolfSmolf7>https://x.com/SmolfSmolf7</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>Twitter is full of bots that promote Miles Guo's movement in various languages and that also post content from western conspiracy media. However it's not that well known that there are also similar bots that promote the Raelian UFO cult and that promote the same type of conspiracy content. One of the accounts is called NobbyRaelian, which posts in Japanese. It reposts a similar set of accounts that are also posted by other bots that promote content from controlled alt media, including BRICS News, illuminatibot, Concerned Citizen, Stew Peters, Mario Nawfal, Epoch Times, healthbot, Vigilant Fox, KanekoaTheGreat, Jim Ferguson, and Wide Awake Media:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-nobby.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>The Raelian bot NobbyRaelian posted this video where Mike Adams said that there was a wire coming out of one of Hirschman's clots, and the wire was made out of repeating patterns that looked like reptilian scales: [<a href=https://x.com/NobbyRaelian/status/1908306733124247741>https://x.com/NobbyRaelian/status/1908306733124247741</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-bot-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The same Raelian bot also posted many videos of Bryan Ardis, who was the star of the Watch the Water movie which was Stew's previous hit movie before Died Suddenly:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-nobby-ardis.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The Japanese Raelian bot also posted this video that promoted The Wellness Company's Spike Detox product:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-bot-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>As another example of an account that looks like a bot and that has promoted the story about calamari clots, I found an account called Ellenng2013 posts about western conspiracy content in Chinese. It doesn't promote Miles Guo's movement, but it still reposts the same type of accounts that are reposted by the Guo bots and Raelian bots, like for example Thekeksociety, bambkb, WideAwakeMedia, thehealthb0t, iluminatibot, ShadowOfEzra, KanekoaTheGreat, BGatesIsaPsycho, and redpillb0t:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-guoretweet.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>Ellenng2013 also promotes flat earth:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-guoflat.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>And it posted this tweet where Tom Haviland showed calamari clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trustgod-kalamari.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Ellenng2013 also promoted TWC's Spike Detox product:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-bot-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The account of the leader of Raelianism only posts links and retweets, so it might be either a bot or a human-bot hybrid. It also retweets a similar set of accounts that are retweeted by bots, including accounts that promote Raelianism that are clearly bots. The emblem of Raelianism features a Star of David and a swastika which are also featured in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, but Rael and other Raelian accounts appear to be fans of Assange who grew up in a neo-Theosophical cult. Maitreya Rael also retweeted videos of kalamari clots that were posted by thehealthb0t and DiedSuddenly_: [<a href=bot2.html#Maitreya_Rael>bot2.html#Maitreya_Rael</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-rael-retweet.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>One time Maitreya Rael posted a link to an article by Vigilant News which said <span class="quote">"Check up this awesome contentDr. Peter McCullough Gives Expert Testimony on the Safety and Efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccines"</span> (which unusually said <span class="quote">"check up"</span> instead of <span class="quote">"check out"</span>, and the words <span class="quote">"content"</span> and <span class="quote">"Dr."</span> were joined together):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-maitreya-checkup-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I searched for tweets that matched the text <span class="quote">"Check up this awesome contentDr."</span>, I found bots that had posted links to several other articles about McCullough at Vigilant News. McCullough is TWC's chief scientific officer, and Vigilant News Network was founded by TWC's cofounder Foster Coulson: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22check+up+this+awesome+contentdr.%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22check+up+this+awesome+contentdr.%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>This tweet says in Chinese that <span class="quote">"embalmer Richard Hirschman and other collaborating researchers (including retired organic chemist Dr. Greg Harrison) analyzed the composition of these blood clots. They found that these blood clots contained a class of abnormally folded starch-like proteins called prions"</span>.

<div>
<img src=i/clot-qbot-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The tweet was posted by an account that posts western MAGAboomer content in Chinese. I'm not sure if the account is a bot or not. Its banner image is an image of Elon Musk:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-qbot-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Many of the earliest tweets by the account were replies to Joe Biden that were written in English: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Am16tri+until%3A2021-5-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Am16tri+until%3A2021-5-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The same account posted a lot about Q: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Am16tri%20%23q&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Am16tri%20%23q&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The bio of the Twitter user m16tri has a link to a Rumble channel which also contains western MAGAboomer content translated to Chinese. Here it posted a video panel that featured the Carrie Madej and Lee Merritt, who both say there's hydras in COVID vaccines. And it posted a video where Ryan Cole talked about calamari clots with Drew Pinsky, who is a member of TWC's Chief Medical Board: [<a href=https://rumble.com/c/m16?page=5>https://rumble.com/c/m16?page=5</a>]</p>

<p>A video of Kevin McCairn posted by SenseReceptor was quoted by an account called <a href=https://x.com/lex_is_lex_>lex_is_lex_</a> that posts in Chinese: [<a href=https://x.com/lex_is_lex_/status/1911825548373869052>https://x.com/lex_is_lex_/status/1911825548373869052</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-lex-1.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The most recent tweets of the Chinese account also included quote tweets of NicHulscher, _aussie17, vegastarr, iluminatibot, toobaffled, VigilantFox, liz_churchill10, P_McCulloughMD, redpillb0t, ShadowofEzra, DiedSuddenly_, BGatesIsaPyscho, and newstart_2024 (which are all promoted by the same type of bots that promote SenseReceptor).</p>
<p>If you scroll through the timelines of enough of these accounts, it's uncanny how they always repost a similar set of accounts. But there's other popular accounts that almost never get reposted by these accounts. I think there's some kind of a whitelist of accounts which are designated to be artificially amplified by bots.</p>
<p>The account lex_is_lex_ also quoted this tweet about how there was a Morgellons fiber in Jane Ruby's chemtrail fog: [<a href=https://x.com/lex_is_lex_/status/1907591417758638446>https://x.com/lex_is_lex_/status/1907591417758638446</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-lex-2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>lex_is_lex_ also quoted a video posted by thehealthb0t about ball bearings self-assembling in castor oil. When I searched for the text of the tweet in double quotes, I found that a similar tweet had been posted by ProjectTabs (which I earlier found had posted a similar tweet about the calamari clots as the flat earther bot sophiadahl1):</p>

<p>Chad Whisnant was featured prominently in the Died Suddenly movie, but I found little information about him, and I didn't find any place he had appeared in alt media apart from the Died Suddenly movie. Whisnant and Nicky Rupright King are both people from Alabama who know Richard Hirschman.</p>
<p>The Died Suddenly movie featured about 7 minutes of footage of Steve Kirsch, which was the second most footage of any person after Hirschman, even though Kirsch didn't even talk about the clots in the movie. Kirsch seems to be connected to the story about the clots in multiple ways, because I believe he was the second person after Jane Ruby who interviewed Richard Hirschman. And he was the first person who interviewed Anna Foster and Cary Watkins, who to my knowledge are the next two people after Hirschman who claimed they had seen the calamari clots. And some of Tom Haviland's surveys were also published by Kirsch, and Kirsch has hosted video panels about the clots on his VSRF channel.</p>
<p>Ryan Cole is the earliest person I have found who claimed to have seen the calamari clots but who is not a mortician, but he was also one of the few non-morticians who were featured in the Died Suddenly movie.</p>

</h3>
<p>I haven't seen anyone on mainstream media claim that they started to see a new type of white clots in 2021.</p>
<p>In February 2024 Aussie17 posted a video to Substack with the title <span class="quote">"Kaboom! Renowned Neurologist and Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre Lead Prof. Dr. Thiravat Hemachudha Exposes Vaccine-Linked White Clots on Thailand's Popular TV3"</span>. [<a href=https://www.aussie17.com/p/kaboom-renowned-neurologist-and-thai>https://www.aussie17.com/p/kaboom-renowned-neurologist-and-thai</a>] So I thought maybe there's now finally a doctor who claims to have seen calamari clots on mainstream media.</p>
<p>However the Thai neurologist indicated that the source of his information was John Campbell's YouTube channel, and he didn't say he or anyone he knows had personally seen the clots:</p>
