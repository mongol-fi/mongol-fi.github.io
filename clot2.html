calamari clots made of spider silk protein coded by the Pfizer reverse
ORF?</a>
</h2>
<p>During an interview with Mary Holland from CHD, Ana Maria Mihalcea
claimed that the calamari clots contained spider silk protein. She said:
<span class="quote">"Clifford Carnicom and I have got the deceased clots
from Richard Hirschman, we got a clot from a living vaccine injured
person, and from an unvaccinated individual. And what we looked at is
clearly this rubber-like material that we know about. And we did by
mircoscopy, and we found the same filaments that we see in the blood,
absolutely the same stuff, okay. And then we did near-infrared
spectroscopy and found that these things have a polyenes, which is
polyethylene alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, which is plastic, and
polyamide, which is silk, nylon, or Kevlar. And specifically, you know,
Kevin Kerningham, Dr.Â Kerningham [meant McKernan] found the genes of DNA
of spidroins of spider silk. That's the strongest military-grade
material that they have made. And so we found these in the
clots."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970364993798325>https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970364993798325</a>,
time 41:40]</p>
<p>However McKernan did not actually find a spidroin protein in the
Pfizer vaccine sequence, but <span class="quote">"spidroin"</span> was a
nickname he gave for the long open reading frame he found on the reverse
strand of the Pfizer sequence. When he searched for the reverse ORF on
UniProt BLAST using extremely liberal settings, the closest match
happened to be a protein that was annotated as a spidroin by chance,
even though it was an extremely distant match that had only about 25%
identity, and it wasn't returned as a hit when he ran regular BLAST with
the default settings:

<img src=i/clot-spidroin.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>The spidroin protein sequence was likely misannotated, and it was
removed from UniProt in June 2024, so it is no longer even returned as a
result if you do a BLAST match for the reverse ORF. But before it had
been removed, I downloaded the Pfizer plasmid sequence that McKernan
uploaded to GenBank, and I picked the longest ORF on the reverse
strand:</p>

href="https://www.uniprot.org/blast"
class="uri">https://www.uniprot.org/blast</a>.</a> McKernan ran his
BLAST search in late 2023, but I ran the search several months later
when there had been more sequences added to the UniProt database. So now
the spidroin protein only came on third place, but the best two matches
were a protein from algae and a cockroach protein. But all of them had a
poor match with only about 25% identity:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-spidroin-old.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>From the table above you can also see that the match to the
misannotated spidroin protein has a length of 1,496 aa and about 24%
identity, but the matches to the next 5 closest proteins have similar
percentage identities around 25% and length around 500-4000 aa. The
match to the spidroin has an E-value of about 1.3e-9, which is meant to
indicate how many similarly close matches are expected to occur by
chance. But in this case the E-value is clearly too low, which might be
because the query sequence had an unusual distribution of amino acids
because it was the reverse complement of a codon-optimized sequence, but
the E-value was calculated using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix which
assumed a natural distribution of amino acids.</p>

<p>Spider silk proteins (spidroins) and the reverse open reading frame
(ORF) of the Pfizer plasmid exhibit similar amino acid compositions, but
for entirely different reasons. In the case of spider silk, the biased
amino acid composition is a result of evolutionary selection for
mechanical properties such as strength, elasticity, and hydrophobicity.
Spidroins are rich in glycine and alanine, which contribute to flexible
and crystalline regions of the silk, respectively. Leucine and valine
are also prominent, helping to stabilize hydrophobic interactions.
Conversely, spidroins contain very low amounts of aromatic residues
(tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine) and polar charged residues, as
these are not advantageous for the physical properties of silk
fibers.</p>
<p>In contrast, the reverse ORF from the Pfizer plasmid is not a
biologically meaningful protein. Its amino acid composition is an
artifact that arises from codon optimization used to express the vaccine
gene efficiently in human cells. Codon optimization increases the
frequency of certain nucleotides, particularly guanine and cytosine, to
match human codon usage preferences. When this optimized sequence is
taken in reverse and read in an alternative frame, it produces a
pseudo-protein sequence with an amino acid composition that reflects
these underlying nucleotide biases rather than any functional
protein-coding information.</p>
<p>As a result, the reverse ORF also shows a high abundance of glycine,
alanine, leucine, and valine. This is because codons rich in guanine and
cytosine frequently map to these amino acids when read in the reverse
complement strand. Other residues like glutamine, aspartic acid, and
histidine also appear with elevated frequencies due to similar codon
artifacts. The similarity in amino acid composition between the spidroin
and the reverse ORF is therefore coincidental, stemming from the
statistical properties of the genetic code and the influence of codon
optimization, rather than from any evolutionary relationship.</p>
<p>This convergence in amino acid composition leads to misleading BLAST
results. BLAST scoring is affected not only by exact sequence identity
but also by overall composition similarities. Consequently, even
sequences with low identity can produce low E-values if their amino acid
distributions are comparable. In this case, the reverse ORF's accidental
resemblance to spidroin composition results in false-positive BLAST
hits, despite the lack of true homology. This reflects a
composition-driven artifact, not an indication of biological
relatedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spidroin protein is no longer returned as a match by UniProt. The
protein was deleted from UniProt in June 2024 for the reason that that
it was an <span class="quote">"excluded proteome"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G1Y380/history>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G1Y380/history</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-spidroinexcluded.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>UniProt says that reasons for excluding a proteome include incorrect
assembly, contamination, or misidentification of the source organism.
[<a href=https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_exclusion_reasons>https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_exclusion_reasons</a>]</p>
<p>The source organism of the protein at both UniProt and GenBank listed
is a bacterium called <em>Nitrospirillum amazonense</em>. But bacteria
do not produce spider silk unless they have been modified genetically,
and the protein sequence came from a paper which described a natural
species of bacteria and not genetically modified bacteria.</p>
<p>The entry for the protein at UniProt was copied from this entry at
GenBank: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023.><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023"
class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023</a>.</a> The
entry at GenBank includes some metadata that was missing from UniProt,
including a note for the CDS that says <span class="quote">"identified
by sequence similarity; putative"</span>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entry shown for <em>Nitrospirillum viridazoti</em> Y2 listing
<span class="quote">"Major ampullate spidroin 1 MaSp1"</span> is likely
a case of misannotation due to automated sequence similarity searches.
Here is why this happens:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Annotation by Homology</strong>: The GenBank entry notes
that this sequence was <span class="quote">"identified by sequence
similarity; putative."</span> This means that during the annotation
pipeline, the protein sequence showed local similarity to known spidroin
sequences, possibly because of repetitive glycine- and alanine-rich
regions or structural motifs that resemble spidroin proteins. Such
repetitive domains are common in unrelated proteins across various
species.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Spurious Similarity to ATPase Domains</strong>: The region
annotation (COG3903) refers to a predicted ATPase domain, which is a
general function category not specific to silk proteins. ATPase domains
are found in many proteins across life forms. The resemblance to
spidroins might arise from structural repeats or motifs that
coincidentally align with spider silk sequences, especially in large,
repetitive bacterial proteins.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Conceptual Translation Artifact</strong>: The comment
mentions <span class="quote">"Method: conceptual translation,"</span>
indicating this is a predicted open reading frame (ORF) from genome
sequencing data, not experimentally validated. Large bacterial genomes
often contain long ORFs with repetitive low-complexity regions that can
artifactually match spidroin sequences in databases.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Misleading Product Naming</strong>: The product is named
<span class="quote">"Major ampullate spidroin 1 MaSp1,"</span> but this
is a bioinformatic label assigned due to sequence similarity, not
functional evidence. No experimental data supports that
<em>Nitrospirillum viridazoti</em> produces spider silk proteins.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Source Confusion</strong>: <em>Nitrospirillum
viridazoti</em> is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium associated with plants,
not arachnids. There is no biological reason for it to produce silk
proteins. The naming likely results from a bioinformatics pipeline
matching a segment of bacterial protein to a spidroin database
entry.</p>

<p>This lady on Twitter said that the spidroin clots can be activated
remotely (which is similar to the theory by Mike Adams that the calamari
clots contain electric circuits that can be triggered by 5G to kill
people):

<p>Someone on Twitter said that the reason why the clots are stained by
Thioflavin T might be because spidroin has amyloid-like properties:

<p>Ulrike KÃ¤mmerer said that the reverse ORF actually codes for spider
silk, but she didn't mention anything about how the ORF only had an
extremely distant match to a spidroin sequence at UniProt, or how the
sequence was misannotated. And she said the spidroin is extremely
durable, and that once the human body has been instructed to form
spidroin, the spidroin can no longer be degraded because it is a foreign
protein, which will lead to the buildup of spider silk inside the body.
She said it was similar to the accumulation of prions in mad cow
disease, and she said the spider silk will destroy cells as it
accumulates in human tissue. And she said that Arne Burkhardt had found
symptoms of a new type of amyloidosis in people who died from a COVID
vaccine, which she speculated might have been due to the spidroin
protein. She said this in German:
[<a href=https://www.aussie17.com/p/biologist-prof-dr-ulrike-kammerer>https://www.aussie17.com/p/biologist-prof-dr-ulrike-kammerer</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then they looked at the opposite strand and found out that there
is a gene inside which ultimately codes for spider silk. There's
something in there a spider silk that means spidroin. And that makes
even less sense. What does the gene information for a spider silk
protein do in a manufacturing vector that is supposed to only produce
RNA for the COVID-19 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein? [...]
Spiders have these extremely durable spider silks, from which the spider
webs are built. [...] And this means that this spidroin, this spider silk
protein, is produced in human cells. [...] But the problem is, once this
protein is formed, it can no longer be broken down by the cells or
degraded by the body. We have no mechanisms to break down this protein.
[...] It's a foreign protein to which our organism has no response,
because it's actually not supposed to be there. [...] So for the body to
be able to break down proteins again, which is always a build-up and
breakdown process, this only works if they have a certain folding and
property. And the mechanisms in evolution are simply intended for human
proteins in humans. Spiders are not intended. And these proteins can
then no longer be broken down. And that's exactly the problem, they
accumulate. You can imagine it like with that mad cow disease, with
those prions, which can't also be broken down and accumulate in the
brain causing damage. And similarly, you can imagine the function of
this spider silk protein in the body. [...] It accumulates, can't be
broken down and destroys the cells or the tissue functions. [...] I know
from Arne Burkhardt, the sadly deceased pathologist from Reutlingen, who
saw strange deposits in slices from deceased due to the RNA injections.
that reminded him of a rare disease that does occur in humans called
amyloidosis. It looked like amyloidosis to him optically, but he
couldn't stain it with the typical methods used for amyloidosis in
pathology. This means he has seen a new disease, as he explained to me,
where it looks like amyloidosis, but cannot be diagnosed with the
conventional methods. That would of course make sense now. Now, one
simply has to look in the future, one can also prove these spider silk
proteins with targeted antibodies, whether they are actually these
spider silk proteins.</p>

The paper also described a benchmark where AmyloGram was compared
against other similar utilities, where the length of the input sequences
ranged from 6 to 14 amino acids.</p>

<p>An account that promotes Miles Guo posted this video where Ana Maria

<p>In an interview David Speicher did in September 2024, he said: <span
class="quote">"If you encode going reverse, you get another intact open
reading frame that's perfectly intact. You get this whole fibroin heavy
chain, which is major ampullate spidroin 1, MaSp1. And that is the same
fibroin that's found in silkworm silk. And what are we pulling out of
the dead vaxxed people? All of these white fibrinous clots. And these
silk proteins are used in spider silk. The thing about spider silk is
that if it's in the spider at the right pH and the temperature, it's a
liquid form. If it's outside and it cools and the pH changes is when
things start to solidify and make silk. So I think - and a lot of groups
worldwide are looking at this - but there could be a major link between
these clots and what's actually in the intact plasmid DNA."</span>

<p>Speicher showed the slide below where the percentage identities of
the matches were covered up, so people couldn't see that the proteins
that matched the reverse ORF had only about 25% identity. His image
showed that most positions of the amino alignment did not match, but
many of his followers probably failed to understand what the alignment
meant. And Speicher didn't say anything about how the match to the
spidroin protein had an extremely low identity and how it was likely due
to chance:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-speicher-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>When Speicher said that <span class="quote">"you get this whole
fibroin heavy chain, which is major ampullate spidroin 1, MaSp1"</span>,
he mixed up the spider silk protein that was the first match with the
silkworm silk protein that was the third match. But they were two
different proteins, and the fibroin is not a spidroin and the spidroin
is not a fibroin. And both proteins had the host species listed as a
species of bacteria which doesn't produce either spider silk or silkworm
silk, so both sequences were likely mislabeled, and they have both now
been deleted from UniProt.</p>
<p>Speicher also showed this slide which suggested that the calamari
clots might be connected to the reverse ORF:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-speicher-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Speicher has a PhD degree in virology, and he has done a postdoctoral
fellowship in bioinformatics, so I have a hard time believing he would
be stupid enough to think that the reverse ORF would actually code for
spider silk. It seems more likely that he is deliberately promoting
disinformation. But he is also one of the main people who have pushed
Kevin McKernan's narrative about DNA contamination, which I think
increases the likelihood that it's a disinformation narrative (even
though the DNA contamination itself seems to be real, but its
implications seem to be vastly exaggerated by McKernan and Speicher).
But it's interesting that McKernan is now also one of the people who is
supposed to have analyzed the calamari clots in a lab.</p>
<p>In October 2023 a preprint about DNA contamination was published by
David Speicher, Jessica Rose, Maria Gutschi, David Wiseman, and Kevin
McKernan. [<a href=https://osf.io/mjc97_v1/>https://osf.io/mjc97_v1/</a>]
In 2023 Maria Gutschi did a presentation where she said: <span
class="quote">"So Kevin and group tried to determine what does this
protein make - what does mRNA make. The closet thing they found was silk
protein, spider protein. Spider silk. Wow. And so, we don't know if
that's happening or not - there's a lot that needs to be done - and
whether that is the case. But it is a large concern on my side. Because
it is not an accident that this mRNA is there on the opposite side. In
my opinion it's not."</span>

<p>Jessica Rose has written many Substack posts where she has presented
Kevin McKernan's findings in a popularized format. She also wrote a
Substack post about the reverse ORF, where she spent most of the post
writing about spider silk as if it would somehow be relevant to the
reverse ORF, or as if people needed to learn about spider silk to
understand the reverse ORF.
[<a href=https://jessicar.substack.com/p/what-a-tangled-web-we-may-have-weaved>https://jessicar.substack.com/p/what-a-tangled-web-we-may-have-weaved</a>]
She also wrote about a paper titled <span class="quote">"Spidroin
N-terminal domain forms amyloid-like fibril based hydrogels and provides
a protein immobilization platform"</span>, and she concluded the post by
writing: <span class="quote">"Could it be that amyloidogenic peptides
akin to spidroin are being translated in people and subsequently
creating immobilizing hydrogel scaffolds for other proteins?"</span>
(But Bryan Ardis also said that the calamari clots are made up of two
snake venom peptides in hydrogel, and Ana Maria Mihalcea has said that
the clots are made of both hydrogel and spider silk. This
McKernan-Rose-Speicher-KÃ¤mmerer network is starting to look like a
backup net that catches people who are too refined to be captured by the
Peters-Ruby-Ardis-Mihalcea net.)</p>
<p>In her Substack post, Jessica Rose briefly mentioned that the reverse
ORF had a weak homology of only about 25% to the spidroin protein, but
she didn't write about how the match was likely due to chance, and how
the spidroin had nothing to do with the reverse ORF, and there were many
other random proteins that had a similarly close match. And she didn't
even post instructions on how people can repeat the BLAST search
themselves. I called her out for how misleading the post was, because
she must have known it would be misinterpreted by her readers.

Jessica Rose has a PhD degree in the computational biology of viruses,
so she should've known the reverse ORF had nothing to do with spider
silk, so her post seemed like she was deliberately trying to mislead
people.</p>
<p>In March 2025 Richard Fleming published a PDF by the Czech biologist
SoÅa PekovÃ¡, who is supposed to have verified McKernan's finding of DNA
contamination, and who is basically the Jessica Rose type figure of the
Czech Republic. It might be a coincidence, but SoÅa PekovÃ¡ is a member
of a neo-Theosophical cult called ALLATRA that has many similarities to
Ana Maria Mihalcea's cult:

ALLATRA teaches that reality is oppressed by Draco Reptilians, that
Slavs are the oldest ethnic group after the fall of Atlantis, and that
there is a 12,000-year pole shift cycle. In one of her interviews SoÅa
PekovÃ¡ talked about Pleiadians and 5D ascension, and she said that Gaia
has the capability to reach not only 5D but 9D reality, even though
vaccinated people may not be able to reach a higher dimension. Even
though the cult is overtly based in Ukraine, they run a multilingual
media operation that produces content in various languages, and their
most popular content are English-language deep fake videos that employ
the avatar of an American veteran spook called Egon Cholatkian. And in
the same way that Scientology is partnered with the Nation of Islam,
ALLATRA is also partnered with an African American freemasonic lodge
called the World's Masonic United Nations.</p>

<p>In August 2025 Kevin McKernan came up with a new theory that the
clots might be caused by a cryptic ORF in the SV40 promoter, and

<p>Ana Maria Mihalcea has a unique theory on how the calamari clots are
formed, because she told Mary Holland from CHD that the clots are formed
when nanobots eat red blood cells: <span class="quote">"I analyzed these
clots microscopically and found these nanotechnological filaments in
there. And Clifford Carnicom and I - we also did chemical analysis on
them. I also filmed how the clots actually assemble. What you see is
unvaccinated blood, the nano robotic swarm. You see all these green and
orange and yellow lights. And they are hijacking the electricity from
the red blood cells, and they're killing them basically to feed
themselves. It's called energy harvesting, it's well described in the
nanotechnological literature. And so these robots then, what they leave
in their wake is this. This is the same blood 30 minutes later. The
blood is completely destroyed. The robots have moved on. And this is the
rubbery clot that we've been seeing. And that you can see how it
self-assembles, and literally builds when you are leaving the - when
you're drawing the blood, and you are leaving it out for at least four
hours."</span>

<p>During the interview with Mary Holland from CHD, Mihalcea also
said:</p>
<ul>
<li>That she and David Nixon found microchips that emitted MAC addresses
in vaccines. [25:25]</li>
<li>That metals are used for battlefield interrogation in the military
space, because the more metals an individual has, the more easily they
can be surveilled through facial recognition. [29:41]</li>
<li>That her colleague Pedro Chavez from Mexico found that there's MAC
addresses emitted from grave sites. [37:19]</li>
<li>That calamari clots contain the same polymers that are being sprayed
in chemtrails. [45:15]</li>
<li>That EDTA prevents the formation of calamari clots because EDTA
kills nanobots by chelating metals out of them. [45:25]</li>
<li>That there's microelectronics from chemtrails in the blood of wild
deer. [50:16]</li>
</ul>
<p>But somehow Mary Holland didn't have anything critical to say to
Mihalcea, and she never asked Mihalcea questions like <span

I didn't find any presentation David Nixon did for M4DCE, even though

<p>The earliest public interview of David Nixon I have found was
published by Ana Mihalcea in October 2022.

<p>A user on Twitter said that the clots in the thumbnail of this video
were <span class="quote">"calamari-like clotting"</span>, even though
the clots had formed inside a surgery drain tube:

<p>But an MD user replied: <span class="quote">"Uhm, yeah. After week of
surgery drainage, white clotting in them is not unusual at all. After
all its the fibrin rich wound secretions drained through plastic tubes.
Usually you pull them, before they clot. Its totally different to havin

The user also wrote: <span class="quote">"Clotting cascades are

Lymphadenectomy can leave a huge wound inside, so drain is left as long

<p>Later when another user posted a video of the clots in a surgery
drain tube, the MD user pointed out that it was a surgery drain tube,
and that wound secretions that are drained by the tube have a high
fibrin content:

<p>Richard Hirschman also shared the same video by the lady who showed
the clots in a surgery drain tube, and he wrote: <span
class="quote">"The clots she shows look very similar to the ones that I
have been seeing during the embalming process, the difference is she's
alive and those who I embalm are not. If the clots are the same, they
can't just be postmortem. There was a vascular surgeon whistleblower who
spoke with Dr Philip McMillan about the same type of clots that he has
been seeing. How does a vascular surgeon remove postmortem clots during
the surgery on a living person?"</span>

<p>Some of the clots that are presented as calamari clots may have been
created by a device like a Chandler loop device, where blood is
repeatedly passed through a tube until clots form in the tube. Here's
images of blood clots created with a Chandler loop device (where the
scale bar is 2 cm, so the longest clot in image L20 is about 30 cm):

<p>In order to manufacture clots with the amyloid properties observed by
Kevin McCairn, perhaps bacterial LPS could be added to the blood to
induce misfolding of fibrin, like what was done by Pretorius and Kell
who wrote: <span class="quote">"Here, we show that the addition of tiny
concentrations (0.2 ng l(-1)) of bacterial LPS to both whole blood and
platelet-poor plasma of normal, healthy donors leads to marked changes
in the nature of the fibrin fibres so formed, as observed by
ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopy (the latter implying that
the fibrin is actually in an amyloid Î²-sheet-rich form that on
stoichiometric grounds must occur autocatalytically)."</span>

<hr />
<p>Mike Adams is supposed to have found tin in the clots with ICP-MS. I
thought it might have been if the clots were made with a Chandler loop
device, and the tubes of the device were made of a material like PVC
that contained tin. But ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most published studies, the tubing in Chandler loops is
<strong>not PVC (polyvinyl chloride)</strong>, but rather
<strong>silicone tubing</strong>. Silicone is chosen because it is
flexible, biocompatible, transparent, and relatively inert with respect
to protein adsorption and platelet activation.</p>
<p>PVC tubing is generally avoided in hemocompatibility studies
because:</p>
<ul>
<li>PVC often contains plasticizers (e.g., DEHP) that can leach into
blood.</li>
<li>PVC has higher thrombogenicity compared to silicone or
fluoropolymer-based tubing.</li>
<li>It may alter experimental outcomes by activating coagulation or
complement pathways.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have also thought that the objects that are presented as calamari
clots might be clots from surgical drain tubes. But when I asked ChatGPT
if surgical drain tubes are made of PVC or a material that contains tin,
it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surgical drains and pleural catheters are <strong>not usually made
from PVC</strong>, and typically do <strong>not contain organotin
stabilizers</strong> (which are sometimes used in PVC formulations). The
materials are selected for flexibility, biocompatibility, and minimal
tissue reaction.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown by device type:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surgical drains (e.g., Jackson-Pratt, Blake drains, Penrose
drains):</strong></li>
<li>Most modern versions are made of <strong>medical-grade
silicone</strong>.</li>
<li>Older Penrose drains may be made of <strong>latex
rubber</strong>.</li>
<li>Silicone is preferred because it is biocompatible, inert, and does
not leach plasticizers or stabilizers.</li>
<li><strong>Pleural catheters (e.g., PleurX, intercostal drains, chest
tubes):</strong></li>
<li>Commonly made from <strong>silicone</strong> or
<strong>polyurethane</strong>.</li>
<li>Some large-bore chest tubes (especially older models) have been made
of <strong>PVC</strong>, but this is less common today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding <strong>tin compounds</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organotin stabilizers (like dibutyltin, monobutyltin) are mainly
associated with <strong>PVC medical devices</strong> (e.g., older blood
bags, some tubing).</li>
<li><strong>Silicone and polyurethane catheters do not require tin
stabilizers</strong> in their manufacture.</li>

<p>Philip McMillan offers a free online course about the calamari clots,
which is basically just a website where you have to enter an email
address in order to see the content. The course features a section
titled <span class="quote">"Observations from Endovascular
Surgeon"</span>, which consists of a 5-page document that looks like a
letter from a surgeon to McMillan:
[<a href=https://vejonhealth.learnworlds.com/course/embalmers-clots-composition-and-cause>https://vejonhealth.learnworlds.com/course/embalmers-clots-composition-and-cause</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-surgeonletter.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>The surgeon wrote that they had not seen calamari clots in their lab:
<span class="quote">"Anyway, I was looking for examples of what I heard
your guy talking about. We also did a lot of vein patients but, once
again, though I was watching out for these cases, I never saw/heard
about any of our patients (and we had a very active Vein Practice, at
least prior to Covid) having extensive venous blockages like your
witness produced. DVT's are not that uncommon in a very busy vein
ablation practice. We were doing upwards of 30-45 venous ablations a
week, on average, prior to Covid. Covid really did a number on us, like
other clinics, especially when people started locking down. But the
DVT's that we experienced post mRNA Vaccine deployment, and once again,
the vast majority of our patients were mRNA vaccinated, their clots were
easily managed and fully resolved with a course of anticoagulative
treatment, usually within 2-3 weeks. There had to be one in there, but
maybe we just didn't identify it."</span></p>
<p>The surgeon also wrote: <span class="quote">"Without understanding
the timing of onset of theses white, fibrous clots, when they began
forming, either weeks/months prior to their event or just days before
their event, I don't know how we could have missed these blockages
during the procedures. Moreover, all of our patients, within a week or
two prior to a venous ablation or arterial intervention, had a full
vascular ultrasound study that would certainly have demonstrated these
obvious tissue amalgamations, even the smaller ones. Most certainly the
larger ones I've witnessed on your podcasts with your whistleblowers and
your embalmers. No way, with our technologist talents, could these
growths have been missed."</span></p>
<p>The surgeon speculated that the reason they weren't seeing the clots
may have been if the clots formed soon before death: <span
class="quote">"The only real conclusions I can come to, during the
entire time of witnessing our practice's patient demographics and the
procedures we performed on them, and many of them were repeat customers,
sometimes requiring multiple repeat annual interventions, is that these
blood clots, fibrous or jelly, must happen rather abruptly, because our
patients typically receive follow up vascular Ultrasonography 2-3 times
per year, and we never noticed these large blockages that would
certainly, without a doubt be able to visualized. Our equipment was the
best. Our very best techs would have found them too. My surgeon partner
looked at every single study personally. Nothing out of the ordinary,
anyway. So this makes me hypothesize that these structures must form
very quickly in an acute way, resulting in the patient needing an
emergency trip to the hospital, or dying and going to the
embalmers."</span> However for example Tom Haviland has said that the
reason why morticians say they only started seeing the clots in mid-2021
might be if the clots take about half a year to form. And Nicky Rupright
King said she didn't start seeing the clots until 2022, and she
suggested the clots might take more than a year to reach their full
size. And anyway if the clots only take days to form, then why weren't
embalmers already seeing the clots in January 2021?</p>
<p>The surgeon who sent the letter to McMillan wrote: <span
class="quote">"Unlike the clinic of the Whistleblower in your podcast,
that was a hospital that did every body part, from the brain to the
heart to the lower extremities, we were limited to doing pelvic and
lower extremity endovascular atherectomies and angioplasties. Of course
we did some stenting, when necessary."</span> But I don't think that
would explain why people in his lab were not seeing any calamari clots.
A more likely explanation is that the clots are a hoax, and McMillan's
cath lab whistleblower was lying.</p>
<p>I didn't find the surgeon's letter published anywhere else. I also
haven't heard McMillan mention the letter anywhere, and I didn't find it
published on his blog, which might be because the letter conflicts with
the narrative about the clots he is trying to present to his
audience.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's a user on Kevin McCairn's Discord server who works as an ER
doctor, but she said she hadn't seen the clots even though she had done
many CT and MRI scans:</p>

high school friend Azzard Comrie who saw clots during autopsies</a>
</h2>
<p>In February 2025 Philip McMillan published an interview with
Dr.Â Azzard Comrie from Jamaica, who claimed he saw the novel type of
clots during autopsies.
[<a href=https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking>https://philipmcmillan.substack.com/p/doctor-speaks-out-about-shocking</a>]</p>
<p>At the start of the video McMillan said: <span class="quote">"So over
the period of time we have been asking questions about has anyone else
seen these clots, has anyone else stepped forward? And the fact that
nobody has come forward seems to give the impression that this is not
occurring, or if it is it's only random and not too significant."</span>
And that's in fact the impression you get, because there's only a
handful of people I can think of who are not morticians but who claim to
have seen the clots in human bodies, but several of them have been
interviewed by McMillan.</p>
<p>After that McMillan said that Azzard Comrie was his friend from high
school: <span class="quote">"This <em>is</em> someone that I know - and
therefore he has independently however reached out to me - so I have
known him for many many years from my high school days, because we were
at a similar school. And he's also a practicing doctor. But I haven't
been in contact with him for a long time. And so him reaching out to me
at this point is representative of the fact that he wants to raise
awareness of this, not necessarily because of our direct
connection."</span></p>
<p>But what are the odds that out of the few people who are not
morticians but who claim to have seen the clots, one happens to be a
childhood friend of the same guy who was contacted by the anonymous cath
lab whistleblower?</p>
<p>Comrie didn't have his own photos of clots. McMillan showed the photo
below from his cath lab whistleblower, and he asked Comrie if it was
similar to the new types of clots he was seeing, but Comrie said: <span
class="quote">"Very similar. You just take that top half, and that's
exactly what it would have looked like."</span> [19:24] However the
photo looks like a regular red clot and not a novel type of clot:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-comrie-1.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>At time 21:45 McMillan asked: <span class="quote">"So when you
started to see this? This should have been in about 2021 then?"</span>
But Comrie answered <span class="quote">"Yes."</span> And Comrie said he
didn't remember seeing the clots in people who died from COVID 2020.</p>
<p>McMillan also wrote that Comrie observed unusual effects of
vaccination, including a drastic drop in the level of vitamin D, an
entire group of workers developing hypertension, and the heart
increasing to nearly six times the previous size:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B12 and Vitamin D Deficiency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He tracked over 200 patients and found that <strong>nearly all of
them had a drastic drop in Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D levels
post-vaccination.</strong></li>
<li>Even individuals who worked outdoors for hours daily had abnormally
low Vitamin D levels.</li>
<li>B12 levels dropped so drastically that he believes <strong>other
critical micronutrient deficiencies</strong> may also be at play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rise in Thyroid Disorders and Hypertension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>spike in new-onset thyroid disease</strong> and high blood
pressure cases, particularly in previously healthy individuals.</li>
<li>In one workplace, an <strong>entire group of employees developed
hypertension post-vaccine.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drastic Cardiac Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One case stood out: a man with a <strong>normal heart size in
2020</strong> who returned months after vaccination with a <strong>heart
that had enlarged to nearly six times its normal size.</strong></li>
<li>Despite aggressive treatment, he passed away - a case that deeply
troubled Dr.Â Comrie.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said that in severe cases of cardiomegaly, the heart can
enlarge up to 2 to 2.5 times its normal size, but that a sixfold
increase would be incompatible with life.</p>
<p>During the interview Comrie didn't say the heart was exactly six
times the normal size, but he said <span class="quote">"If I had to tell
you based on what I heard, it was probably about six times the
size."</span> [45:08] He also said that the man with the huge heart had
his vitamin B12 level drop from almost 400 to 66 pg/ml.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: Philip McMillan now said this about his interview
with Azzard Comrie: <span class="quote">"A lot of people keep thinking
that if this was happening, everybody would know. And I'm saying you are
underestimating how significant and how powerful the censorship was.
Tom, you had been talking to medics as well. Now just to put it into
context, only in the past maybe 6 to 8 months, I have spoken to the
first medical doctor in the world who was actually doing autopsies and
saw these clots."</span></p>
<p>By the first medical doctor in the world, I think McMillan meant the
first doctor who was speaking out about seeing the clot when they did
autopsies. However Ryan Cole already claimed in March 2022 that he had
pulled out a long calamari clot from a vein, even though he didn't make
it clear if the clot came from a body he did an autopsy on.
[<a href=clot2.html#Ryan_Cole_interviewed_by_Steve_Kirsch_in_March_2022>clot2.html#Ryan_Cole_interviewed_by_Steve_Kirsch_in_March_2022</a>]</p>

<p>In May 2023 Stew Peters released a sequel to the Watch the Water

water.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v2nh8xc-premiere-watch-the-water-2-closing-chapter.html>https://rumble.com/v2nh8xc-premiere-watch-the-water-2-closing-chapter.html</a>]</p>
<p>At time 14:48 Ardis said: <span class="quote">"The actual textilinin
protein from the eastern brown snake prevents your body's plasmin from
breaking down the blood clots. And it's published by them. We have
created a self-assembling nanoparticle hydrogel that causes rapid blood
clotting, rapid blood clotting. And it is resistant to plasmin being
able to break it down, warfarin from being able to break it down - which
is cuminin, a blood thinner - and it's also heparin resistant. And what
did you find in every ICU with COVID-19 patients? They were heparin
resistant. Why? They had ecarin in their body and textilinin."</span>
Then Stew Peters asked: <span class="quote">"Is that what's causing
these white fibrous things that embalmers are finding?"</span> And Ardis
replied: <span class="quote">"1000% that's what's causing them."</span>
So Ardis said he was 1000% sure that the calamari clots were caused by
two snake venom proteins.</p>
<p>At time 37:46 Stew Peters pointed out how Ardis was holding a vial
with calamari clots when he spoke on the ReAwaken America Tour. And
Ardis said they were clots he got from Richard Hirschman, and he again
said that the clots are produced by a hydrogel that contains snake venom
proteins. And he also talked about an Italian paper by Carlo Brogna et
al.Â where the authors found snake venom peptides in the blood and urine
of COVID patients.</p>
<p>At time 40:41, Ardis said: <span class="quote">"Just January 28th of
2023, just a few weeks ago, Dr.Â Chetty MD out of South Africa - is
working this entire time - I have been on Zoom calls with this guy for
three years now, as we're learning about COVID, how to treat COVID, the
success they're seeing in South Africa. Dr.Â Chetty is a great, honest,
ethical human being. He has done phenomenal work. He stated in an
interview on January 28th, 2023 - that in long-hauler COVID patients who
are coming to his clinic from around the world - they couldn't get them
better with traditional therapies they found worked with other COVID
patients. So they ran fecal tests on them to find out is there anything
in their body we're unaware of that would keep these people sick with
long-hauler COVID symptoms?"</span> Then the video cut to a clip where
Shankara Chetty said: <span class="quote">"At that point that we
realized we need to look at stool samples. We need to - if it was found
in sewage, and I couldn't understand why a virus found in sewage was not
tracked backwards to the gastrointestinal tract where it arose, and to
figure out what it was doing there. And so we managed to contact Carlo
Brogna, who's done some very interesting work on coronavirus. Uh, what
he very basically discovered with looking at stool samples was that the
virus was replicating, somehow, in these stool samples, and the stools
had toxins - protein-based toxins in them. He found with the incubation
of the supernatant of this sample on fresh uninfected stool that the
viral title rose exponentially and so the toxins as well. And so he
proved bacterial phage activity, that this virus has the ability to
infect the bacteria of your gut. And he found toxicities there,
toxin-like peptides, which were akin to many different kinds of snake
venoms, sea-snail poisons, shellfish poisons. And it's a wonder how
those got there."</span> Then Ardis said that one way venoms are
manufactured synthetically is using bacteria like <em>E. coli</em>, and
another way is using mammalian cells, so the mRNA vaccines also contain
instructions that cause both bacteria and human cells to produce snake
venom.</p>
<p>Shankara Chetty also wrote on Twitter that SARS-CoV-2 not only acts
as a bacteriophage, but that it also modifies the DNA of bacteria
through insertional mutagenesis to make bacteria produce snake venom. He
also said that Tau Braun told him to keep an eye on snake venom in 2021:
[<a href=https://x.com/ShankaraChetty/status/1900893736399217058>https://x.com/ShankaraChetty/status/1900893736399217058</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tau first mentioned snake venom to me in 2021 to keep my eye on. He
understood that it was being experimented on to be weaponised and could
be aerosolized etc. and spread, but I couldn't figure the transmission
to other individuals by those affected. He planted the seed and asked
that I don't disregard an envenomation as my treatment would address
both Envenomation and Hypersensitivity. With the chronic gut issues we
were seeing and a positive rectal PCR swab reported early on from China,
we contacted Carlo Brogna, who was examining stool. What he found was
that the virus had bacteriophage activity and infected the bacteria in
your gut, replicating in them and getting them, through insertional
mutagenesis, to produce toxins. These toxin like peptides resemble many
different kinds of snake venom, conotoxins (sea snail venom), and
starfish toxin.</p>
<p>That was the revelation that solved all my questions. Transmission of
the toxin occurred through transmission of its code by the virus to the
gut bacteria that then made the toxin. This allowed the toxic proteins
to evade the hosts' digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine
by being made directly in the colon where it can be absorbed
unaltered.</p>
<p>UNNATURAL, INTENTIONAL, WELL PLANNED, TRANSMISSIBLE ENVENOMATION.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to insert DNA into a bacterial genome through insertional
mutagenesis, I think SARS-CoV-2 would need to have reverse
transcriptase. ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a <strong>positive-sense single-stranded RNA
virus</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To cause insertional mutagenesis (i.e., inserting sequences into host
<strong>DNA</strong> genomes), its RNA would need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be reverse-transcribed into DNA</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Be integrated into the DNA genome</strong> of the host

<p>Chetty also wrote that Tau Braun was one of his guardian angels, and
Chetty said that he and Tau Braun were snake oil salesmen (presumably
since they are both trying to sell the story about snake venom):</p>

<p>Tau Braun's bio says that he is a <span class="quote">"U.S. National
Counterterrorism &amp; EMS Advisor and Trainer"</span>, and he has been
a speaker at a bunch of emergency management conferences.
[<a href=https://www.drtaubraun.com/about>https://www.drtaubraun.com/about</a>]
In 2022 he told Jane Ruby that calamari clots are made of tissue that
was programmed to grow snake venom glands by nanobots that used graphene
oxide as a delivery mechanism.

<p>In Watch the Water 2, Bryan Ardis said that he had been on Zoom calls
with Chetty for three years. But there's not too many people in the
COVID conspiracy movement who are as ridiculous as Tau Braun and Bryan
Ardis.</p>
<p>Shankara Chetty is Philip McMillan's sidekick who is frequently
featured in videos on the Vejon Health channel. I started to think that
McMillan was likely controlled opposition after he published several
videos and posts where he promoted Greg Harrison's ORF hoax, but now
that I know how his sidekick also promoted the story about snake venom,
I have even more reason to suspect that McMillan is not sincere.</p>

<p>Shankara Chetty reposted this video which said that COVID vaccines
completely destroy the pineal glands of vaccinated people:

Maria Mihalcea's microscope images of embalmed blood from Hirschman</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2023 Ana Maria Mihalcea said that Hirschman had sent her a sample
of blood mixed with embalming fluid from a body he had embalmed, and she
went on Maria Zeee's show to show microscope images of the sample.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230614195806/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-interview-with-maria-zeee-bidens>https://web.archive.org/web/20230614195806/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-interview-with-maria-zeee-bidens</a>,

<p>She didn't say if Hirschman received consent from the family members
of the dead person for their blood to be paraded around by scammers
(even though it's fairly likely that Hirschman didn't even send her a
real sample of blood from an embalmed person).</p>
<p>She said that the calamari clots were made of hydrogel, but she also
said that fiber-like structures she saw in the blood under a microscope
were made of hydrogel. It reminded me of how Kevin McCairn says that the
calamari clots are made of amyloidogenic peptides, but he also says that
mystery fibers in his microscope images of blood samples are made of
amyloidogenic peptides.</p>
<p>At time 31:07 Mihalcea showed the image below and said: <span
class="quote">"Just showing you these hydrogel classic ribbons that
we've seen in the meat and the rainwater - we've seen them vaccinated
and unvaccinated blood - and it's the same stuff that Clifford Carnicom
and I looked at that also has functional groups that are consistent with
hydrogel. And this is a close up. This is very similar to what Mike
Adams saw in the microscopic analysis of the large clots, with this
central, you know, hollow lining."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mihalceablood-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 40:56 Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"Look at this. All
of a sudden, how is it possible that that the control of these blinking
lights is creating the fluid to come out? This is exactly the process
that David Nixon filmed to create a microchip, okay."</span> And then
Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"Yes. And I mean, I watched that.
People that have watched that have seen it. There's like that - there is
a clear interaction between all of the materials forming, even to the
point of what appears to be little robotic arms setting parameters, so
that this part of the what appears to be a chip doesn't form. And it
pulls, it looks like it's pulling out the rest to make the perfect
shape."</span> A year earlier Maria Zee had broken the news about how
David Nixon found self-assembling robot arms in COVID vaccines.
[<a href=https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/>https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/</a>]</p>
<p>At time 41:46 Mihalcea showed the image below, and she said it showed
a hydrogel ribbon that was assembled out of blinking lights: <span
class="quote">"Are you able to see this filament here? Yes. Okay. So
this 20 minutes later, that drop looked like this. It had built this
hydrogel ribbon. And you can see that all of the surrounding blinking
lights were actually used to create this thing. That wasn't there
before. And this is the kind of hydrogel ribbons that we see in the
blood 20 minutes to assemble this ginormous ribbon."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mihalceablood-2.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 50:59 Mihalcea said her sample also contained self-creating
spheres: <span class="quote">"So the entire blood area was filled with
these kinds of spheres that were self-creating, and that had these small
light particles in there that looked like they were emitting photonic
light."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:07:45 Mihalcea said that calamari clots grow in the
presence of a pulsed electromagnetic field, so an MRI scan might make
the hydrogel clots grow bigger: <span class="quote">"Well, uh, how about
this? Um, so we've shown the pulsed electromagnetic fields, and just
exposing the live blood of a vaccinated person - shows that the clot of
this, the - the rubbery part of the clot, the hydrogel clot makes it
grow. So how many people are getting an MRI scan, even the freedom
doctors who are recommending an MRI for the heart to look for
myocarditis? Is that making the hydrogel inside of them grow? So if you
don't know that certain fields are affecting this technology and could
have an adverse effect, and you don't even know it's in people, then you
don't know how to take precautions. And so, uh, clinicians need to start
learning about this. Because, again, you know, what if you make
somebody's clot grow?"</span> And next she said she had found microchips
growing in dental anesthetics.</p>

<p>A FactCheck.org article about the Died Suddenly movie said the
following:

<blockquote>
<p>Over the last year or so, Hirschman brought in people he worked with
as a contract embalmer in Alabama. He knew three of the morticians who
appeared in the video, he said.</p>
<p>One of them is Chad Whisnant, whose name is spelled incorrectly in
the video.</p>
<p>Whisnant runs a <a href=https://perma.cc/55KT-CBZK>funeral home</a>
in Alabama with his wife, Brooke.</p>
<p>He didn't return our call for comment, but Brooke Whisnant told us in
a phone interview that the clots shown in the video aren't out of the
ordinary and that she doesn't share her husband's view of vaccination,
which has changed over the last several years.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"I'm now an antivaxxer,"</span> Chad Whisnant
said in the video. <span class="quote">"I wasn't before."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"It's been a slow, slow process ever since Trump
took office,"</span> Brooke Whisnant said of her husband's shifting
beliefs after former President Donald Trump took office in 2017. <span
class="quote">"It's been a very weird abyss of misinformation on the
internet,"</span> she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comments by Chad Whisnant's wife seem to indicate that Whisnant
is himself a sincere conspiratard, which makes it seem less likely that
he was some kind of a plant in the conspiracy movement who had been
tasked with producing disinformation. But nevertheless it's interesting
that even though his wife ran the funeral home with him, she said that
the clots that were shown in the Died Suddenly movie were not out of the
ordinary.</p>
<p>Chad Whisnant was featured prominently in the Died Suddenly movie,
but I haven't found any other place where he has appeared in alternative
media. Whisnant's name was misspelled in the Died Suddenly movie, but
when I searched Twitter for the properly spelled form of his name in
double quotes, I found only two tweets which referred to him.

debut interview with Jane Ruby in January 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>During Hirschman's debut interview he did with Jane Ruby, he said:
<span class="quote">"It all started - I can't put my finger on it - but
probably around the mid, middle of last year."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vtcsgw-worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find-veins-and-arteries-filled-with-never-bef.html?start=128>https://rumble.com/vtcsgw-worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find-veins-and-arteries-filled-with-never-bef.html?start=128</a>]
In other early interviews Hirschman similarly said he started seeing the
clots around mid-2021, but later he changed his story to say he might
have already seen the clots earlier.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby asked: <span class="quote">"Mostly you're seeing them and
pulling them from veins, not arteries. Is that correct?"</span> [8:44]
Then Hirschman answered: <span class="quote">"Yes. But on this one here
I also got one out of the artery as well. Which is unusual. I have here
lately been pulling some out of arteries. I pulled one out of an artery
last night."</span> So he made it seem like the clots were more common
in veins than arteries. However later on Hirschman started to say that
the calamari clots were appoximately equally common in veins and
arteries. For example in January 2023 when Chris Martenson asked
Hirschman if the clots were coming out of veins and arteries <span
class="quote">"even-steven"</span> (which means evenly matched),
Hirschman answered <span class="quote">"Yes, exactly."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500>https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500</a>]
During an Hirschman did with Daniel Horowitz in February 2021, which I
believe was Hirschman's third interview, he gave the impression that he
saw the clots in veins at first and arteries later: <span
class="quote">"These clots are unusually firm. They're unusually long.
Sometimes they're short. Sometimes they're long. They're just -
sometimes it looks like they - that you can literally see how they're
branching into different areas of the vein. But then I also started
noticing them starting to appear in arteries, which is very
unusual."</span>
[<a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493</a>,
time 29:19]</p>
<p>But anyway, next Jane Ruby asked: <span class="quote">"Was there any
difference in what you observe from the one you pull from arteries
compared to the ones you pull from veins?"</span> [9:39] But Hirschman
said: <span class="quote">"The ones I pull from veins are much larger
usually."</span> That's another detail he may have omitted in his later
interviews, even though I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Then Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"They usually have that long
strange whitish substance to it, usually a little bit of blood that's
attached to it. Sometimes it seems like they're intermingled. It almost
seems like the white grows almost out of the blood, as weird as that
sounds. Some people are calling me - I call them worms, because to me
they represent - they look very similar to the worms."</span> Then Jane
Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Right, but we don't want to mislead
people to think it's an animal, like a worm. You're just saying that it
-."</span> Then Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"It resembles one
sometimes, often with me, it resembles a worm. I've never seen one move
on its own or anything like that. But it seems, it has the appearance of
small worms. I've had someone that was in the embalmenting with me one
night, and I was - there was a bunch of them coming out in the blood.
And his words were, <span class="quote">'It looks like heartworms for
people.'</span> Not saying they were moving. I'm just saying these
little stringy structures coming out of the blood."</span> Then Jane
Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Now, are these structures that you're
saying resemble like worm-like things - were they separate from the clot
that started with the blood, and then the long piece coming out of
them?"</span> Then Hirschman said <span class="quote">"usually they're
together"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Usually I find a
normal clot attached at one end at work, or I find them intermingled in
with a clot. That's why I can rinse them out, and you can see the white
structure."</span></p>
<p>A similar story that the clots resembled worms or parasites and they
had regular blood clots attached to them was also told by Laura Jeffery,
the anonymous embalmer whose photos were shown by Jane Ruby, and the
pseudonymous funeral director called Carolyn who was interviewed by
Epoch Times.</p>
<p>A draft version of the Epoch Times article said:
[<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While normal blood clots are dark brown in colour, Carolyn said the
fibrous masses are white. But she said they also have a pinkish tone, as
they are <span class="quote">"literally feeding off of blood
clots."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"They remind me of parasites, because they're
creating a blood clot and they're feeding off it,"</span> she said.
<span class="quote">"So every tentacle is basically down a part of the
circulatory system, and at the end of those fingers there is a normal
clot, and it looks like they're feeding off it."</span></p>
<p>Hirschman also said that the fibrous clots appeared to be feeding off
normal blood clots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Canadian embalmer Laura Jeffery said: <span class="quote">"I'm
sort of like this and I see something that I thought was a tapeworm.
Which was weird, because tapeworms shouldn't be in a circulatory system.
And then I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, <span class="quote">'Is
this a parasite?'</span> Because a tapeworm's a parasite; that looked
like a parasite. [...] Then there's a blood clot that is integrated into
the end of those tentacles. It felt like it was a parasite that was
feeding off a blood clot that it created in the body. When you think of
a parasite, you think - because it feeds off of something, right? Then
you see the jelly clots at the end of this parasite. You see those and
you think, <span class="quote">'Are they feeding off us as humans? Out
of our circulatory system?'</span> Because they always had the currant
jelly integrated at the ends."</span>

<p>At time 15:02 Jane Ruby asked Hirschman: <span class="quote">"But
before 2020, like from 2019 and earlier, you've never seen this specific
type of combination clot. Is that what you're saying?"</span> So she
said the calamari clots were <span class="quote">"combination
clots"</span>, as if a distinctive feature of the clots was that they
were attached to regular blood clots.</p>
<p>At time 2:36 Jane Ruby showed the image below, and she said it looked
like a regular red blood clot on the right but it gradually turned <span
class="quote">"more and more white and fibrous"</span> on the right
side, and Hirschman also said it looked like a normal clot on the left
side:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-debut-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Two days after Jane Ruby interviewed Hirschman, she talked about the
interview on the Stew Peters Show. She showed the image above and she
said: <span class="quote">"You can see on the far left of this picture,
there is a red blood clot, which he said, <span class="quote">'When I
touch it, manipulate it, like any blood clot, it does kind of
disintegrate and melt, you know, melt away.'</span> But as he moves
down, and these are his words, not mine, he said <span
class="quote">'This white fibrous piece that becomes the longer portion
of it is very tough, it's stretchy,'</span> he can't break it very
easily, he said <span class="quote">'It looks like it's emanating out of
the clot'</span>, and his words, <span class="quote">'It appears that
it's kind of feeding on the blood and the clot.'</span>"</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vti2i0-embalmers-discover-horror-dr.-ruby-exclusive-arteries-filled-with-rubbery-c.html?start=112>https://rumble.com/vti2i0-embalmers-discover-horror-dr.-ruby-exclusive-arteries-filled-with-rubbery-c.html?start=112</a>]
Ruby also said Hirschman told her that <span class="quote">"I've never
seen this type of clot with a connection to the red portion and then
this rubbery thing, before 2021"</span>. [4:12] So she seemed to
emphasize how the white parts were connected to the red parts. She also
showed this photo where there's red parts of a clot attached to white
parts:</p>

Cole interviewed by Steve Kirsch in March 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>On March 13th 2022 Steve Kirsch published an interview of Ryan Cole.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vxeqvu-pathologist-on-ryan-cole-on-the-mystery-blood-clots.html>https://rumble.com/vxeqvu-pathologist-on-ryan-cole-on-the-mystery-blood-clots.html</a>]</p>
<p>At time 5:19 Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"When did you first
start hearing reports of this?"</span> And Cole answered that he first
heard about the clots on the internet: <span class="quote">"Uh, a couple
months back, you know, I saw the pictures on the internet. A couple of
friends had said, <span class="quote">'Hey, have you ever seen anything
like this? Do you think this is real?'</span> I said, <span
class="quote">'Well, trust but verify is kind of how I work, you know, I
observe. And then I do the science.'</span> And so for me, it was like,
okay, that looks interesting. It looks legitimate. But I'll believe it
when I see it. And now I've seen it."</span></p>
<p>Then Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"The vaccines have been out
for a year. How come you're only seeing this now? Or have people been
seeing it before, and they're just not reporting it before - been too
scared to report it?"</span> [6:16] And Cole answered: <span
class="quote">"I think it's that fear factor. I think, I think you hit
the nail on the head, because as I talked to some of these morticians,
you know, this - I have two hypotheses on these. Number one, they were
seeing it and they were like, huh, this is weird. And didn't think
anything of it. Or it could be after one shot, you don't see a whole lot
of it after two, you see more and after three, you see a lot. So it's
really, it's the boosters that really started, uh, the punch
here."</span> But a problem with his explanation is that the morticians
said the clots were already common before boosters.</p>
<p>At time 16:21 Cole showed the vial of a clot below, and he said the
clot was about 12 inches long and he pulled it out of a big vein. And he
said similar type of clots may have earlier occurred rarely due to
genetic clotting disorders:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cole-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>It was not clear why Cole even had the opportunity to remove a
calamari clot from the body. But he may have been the first person who
claimed to have seen a calamari clot in the body of a dead or living
person but who was not a mortician.</p>
<p>However if Ryan Cole had an opportunity to see the clots through his
work as a pathologist, and he was also talking to other pathologist,
then why did he say that he first heard about the clots a couple of
months ago on the internet?</p>
<hr />
<p>One of many reasons why I think Ryan Cole is controlled opposition is
that he was one of the earliest people who started promoting the turbo
cancer hoax. [<a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>] The term <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was first introduced in September
2021 in the <span class="quote">"pathology conference"</span> that was
held by Arne Burkhardt and Walter Lang, where a German lawyer who was a
member of Reiner FÃ¼llmich's organization conveyed an anecdote about
turbo cancer from Ute KrÃ¼ger. Most of the earliest videos that match the
term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> at BitChute are videos by
the German pathologist Ute KrÃ¼ger. But in a video that was published
only 4 days after Burkhardt's pathology conference, Ryan Cole talked
about how vaccines cause cancer, and he said: <span class="quote">"I'll
have a call later with three German pathologists. They're seeing similar
signals. They're gonna be working on it as well. But it's based -.
Another colleague in Dallas is gonna be working on it. We're trying to
get a consortium of doctors together to study this."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vrnol2-dr.-ryan-cole-is-there-a-covid-vaccine-cancer-connection.html?start=917>https://rumble.com/vrnol2-dr.-ryan-cole-is-there-a-covid-vaccine-cancer-connection.html?start=917</a>]
The three German pathologists probably referred to Arne Burkhardt,
Walter Lang, and Ute KrÃ¼ger. In 2023 Arne Burkhardt was asked if there
were other pathologists who had been able to confirm his findings, but
the only pathologist he named was Ryan Cole.
[<a href=https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/>https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/</a>,
1:51:54] When Ryan Cole said he had a colleague in Dallas, he probably
referred to the oncologist Ray Page, who was a speaker in a conference
in Texas that was livestreamed by Epoch Times, where the speakers also
included Ryan Cole, Peter McCullough, and Bryan Ardis.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzEuYRKdJY&t=1h26m39s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzEuYRKdJY&amp;t=1h26m39s</a>]</p>
<p>Ryan Cole's connection to AFLDS is also suspicious. In July 2021 Cole
became a <span class="quote">"Medical Director"</span> of the Jew Simone
Gold's organization America's Frontline Doctors. The news team of
America's Frontline Doctors is run out of Israel by the Kahanist
Chabadnik Mordechai Sones.
[<a href=https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads>https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads</a>]
Sones also hosted the podcast of AFLDS which is now inactive, but during
the last episode of the podcast he read out a letter by the Rebbe
Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
[<a href=https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah>https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah</a>]
Before COVID Mordechai Sones worked for Israeli mainstream media, and
his LinkedIn profile says that in the 1980s he worked on <span
class="quote">"research in areas of how to upgade CIA covert arms
pipeline to Afghans"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-sones-bab8b916/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-sones-bab8b916/</a>]</p>
<p>When Ryan Cole's medical license was revoked, one of the charges
brought against him was that he had prescribed ivermectin without
obtaining proper informed consent on a telehealth website called
MyFreeDoctor.com, which was affiliated with AFLDS.
[<a href=https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf>https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf</a>]
AFLDS was also affiliated with another similar telehealth website called
SpeakWithAnMD.com, which offered prescriptions for ivermectin and the
Zelenko protocol. It was launched in April 2020 by Jerome Corsi, who
managed two mutual funds for B'nai B'rith, and who told The Forward in
2004 that <span class="quote">"I've been a strong supporter of B'nai
B'rith and Jewish causes for 30 years"</span>.
[<a href=https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/>https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/</a>]

sequencing of calamari clots by Kevin McKernan</a>
</h2>
<p>In May 2025 Kevin McCairn wrote this about McKernan's preliminary
analysis of the calamari clots: <span class="quote">"Late-cycle
amplification signals for SV40 promoter, spike protein coding sequence,
and Ori (origin of replication) suggest low-abundance presence of
residual plasmid DNA consistent with LNP-based recombinant vaccine
components."</span>
[<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin</a>]
And he wrote: <span class="quote">"These results indicate preliminary
molecular evidence for incorporation or association of spike
vaccine-related material within the clot matrices."</span></p>
<p>But two weeks later when McKernan published his sequencing results,
he ended up debunking his own preliminary findings, because he didn't
find a single read that aligned against either the Pfizer or Moderna
vaccine spikes:
<a href=https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin.><a
href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin"
class="uri">https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin</a>.</a></p>
<p>The reads that aligned against the Pfizer plasmid sequence aligned
against components of the plasmid that matched human or bacterial
reads:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pfizerigv.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>When I did a BLAST search for the 300-base region after the spike ORF
that had a large number of aligned reads in McKernan's alignment, it
contained a perfect 141/141 base match to human mtDNA, which is included
in the untranslated region after the spike as a stabilizing element.
Similarly the region before the spike matched various human and
mammalian cloning vectors, and ChatGPT said the region may have mimicked
stable human transcripts like Î²-globin.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have a hypothesis that some calamari clots might be fake clots
created using a Chandler loop device, which is a device circulates blood
through a tube until a clot forms on the walls of the tube. If that is
the case, some of the clots might actually contain blood from multiple
people mixed together rather than blood from only a single donor. So I
wanted to check if McKernan's reads contained DNA from multiple people
mixed together or only a single person.</p>
<p>When I did variant calling for mtDNA haplotypes, I got a total of 50
variants with MAPQ score of 100 or above, which were all simple SNVs.
And 47 of them are shared by the H10e1 haplogroup, which is found in
Northwestern Europe and elsewhere in Europe:
<a href=https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/.><a
href="https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/"
class="uri">https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/</a>.</a> So it looks like
there are not variants from multiple different haplogroups mixed
together, or at least not variants that are frequent enough to get a
high MAPQ score:</p>

<p>I looked at the forward reads of the white clot sample. McKernan
published reads for a white clot and a red clot sample, but I don't know
if both of them are supposed to be novel types of clots that were not
seen before 2021, or if one of them was a regular non-calamari clot that
was used as a control:</p>

professionalism."</span> But the way he outmaneuvered me was by not
answering my questions about his methodology, by not countering my
evidence that he faked his data, by saying I'm a CCP troll, by blocking
me, and by continuing to attack me from behind a block so I couldn't
defend myself.</p>
<p>Greg's AI said I don't have any institutional affiliation or
credentials listed. But I don't have any institutional affiliation or
credentials, because I'm just a conspiratard.</p>
<p>Greg's AI said that I had 5,979 tweets, which was <span
class="quote">"High-volume posting typical of accounts involved in
active information management or disruption activities."</span> But that
was during a period of almost 2 years, which is not a very high volume
of tweeting. In comparison Greg has about 90,000 tweets.</p>
<p>Greg's AI said: <span class="quote">"Early predictive modeling (e.g.,
aggregation potential screens) is part of the scientific process of
hypothesis generation and does not represent final experimental
results."</span> It referred to his AI-generated table of fake data,
which was supposed to show the <span class="quote">"aggregation
potential"</span> of each ORF.
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528</a>]
His table had an ORF that was 60 aa long and had 50% Q/N residues, even
though the maximum number of Q or N residues in any 60 aa segment of
Wuhan-Hu-1 is only 16, which is one of the reasons why I said his ORF
was fake. In order to experimentally verify a statement like <span
class="quote">"SARS-CoV-2 has an ORF that is 60 amino acids long and has
50% Q/N content"</span>, you'd have to sequence the genome of SARS-CoV-2
and then analyze the sequence through the methods of bioinformatics. But
the sequencing part has already been done, and it's easy for random
people to do the bioinformatics analysis at home without needing access
to any lab equipment. If Greg wanted to show that his ORFs are real, he
could simply post the nucleotide range of each of his ORFs in
Wuhan-Hu-1. But he won't do that, because he won't be able to show that
there's any 60 aa ORF with 50% Q/N content.</p>
<p>Greg's AI said it was a <span class="quote">"personal attack"</span>
when I said Greg's ORFs were AI hallucinations. I don't know if the AI
meant a personal attack against itself or against Greg. But Greg's AI is
high on its own supply, because it didn't even say that these images
were AI hallucinations, but that the reason why the text in the images
was garbled was because the images employed a phonetic scrambling
technique used by bioweaponeers:

<p>Greg's AI rated the position of the spike protein as being 100%
accurate, because the spike protein (ORF2) was <span
class="quote">"Correctly labeled and placed around ~21,563-25,384

1,000-8,000 in the first image and nucleotide 5,000 in the second
image.</p>
<p>Greg also wrote <span class="quote">"And here's a few more <span

<p>So apparently the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a circular genome,
and ORF1, ORF2, and ORF7 are contained within the spike protein. There's
three different ORF2 regions in the spike protein, one of which is
embedded within another ORF2.</p>

After I busted Greg's ORF hoax, Kevin McCairn started to deny that he
was associated with Greg Harrison, but Harrison spent a long part of the
interview presenting McCairn's work, and one of McCairn's microscope
images was even featured in a thumbnail of the video:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-reese-1.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>Amyloid fibrils are nano-scale structures that are not visible with
an optical microscope, but Harrison claimed that the image on the right
below showed an amyloid fibril: <span class="quote">"This was an
absolutely brilliant set of images, in the sense that on the right-hand
side, you've got a lining up of the microclots, and on the left-hand
side you've got a mature clot with very large amyloid presences, here.
And I'll put this on the - because this is so important - if you look on
the left-hand side here, can you see the array of microclots? They're
beginning to line up precisely similar to what I just showed you in the
earlier image. And they are agglomerating to form the amyloid
fibril."</span> [27:33]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-reese-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Harrison claimed that the brighter spots in the image on the right
were <span class="quote">"microclots"</span> and the microclots formed
into an amyloid fibril, which would mean that the microclots were
smaller than the amyloid fibril. However a few minutes earlier Tom
Haviland had equated microclots with coffee ground clots, which are
visible with a naked eye. [22:24]</p>
<p>Greg Reese said that McCairn's images reminded him the reptilian
nanowire that Mike Adams found in one of Hirschman's clots: <span
class="quote">"But that reminds me so much of Mike Adams' image that he
took of the - it was a photograph image of an actual hardened clot. So
it was obviously much bigger than what we're looking at here. But it had
that same kind of snake-like skin, you know?"</span> [46:10]</p>
<p>I have asked McCairn why the micrometer-scale clots in his blood
samples have a string-like shape, or if it's because the clots formed
inside capillaries and then got dislodged. McCairn told me it was
because <span class="quote">"there is a coherency in the epistemological
grounding of the amyloid PRION formation"</span>, but I told him it
sounded like pseudo-profound bullshit.

<p>Now Haviland asked a similar question from Harrison: <span
class="quote">"Greg, is there a particular reason why the microclots
like to line up in a linear fashion?"</span> [46:30] Then Harrison said
that it had something to do with the polarity of the particles, which is
a new explanation I don't remember hearing before: <span
class="quote">"Yeah, it's actually a mechanism, Tom. It's due to the
polarity of the particles. And I haven't got it here, but I've done a
deep dive on that, because I was quite interested that the apparent
appearance, if you like, of the linear line up."</span></p>
<p>I don't know what he means by particles or polarity. I tried
searching his Twitter feed for the keywords <span
class="quote">"polarity"</span> and <span
class="quote">"particles"</span>, but I didn't find any tweet that
would've explained why micrometer-scale clots would have an elongated
shape.

<p>I now found the original image of the <span class="quote">"amyloid

At first I thought Greg might have photoshopped the image to blur out
the specks on the left side:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-gregblur-2.webp width=500><img src=i/clot-gregblur-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>But the blur might just be a compression artifact, because in this
bigger version of the image, the specks on the left are not as blurred
out:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-gregblur-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I think what the image actually shows is either the boundary of the
blood drop where the blood had dried out, or the boundary of the drop of
Thioflavin T solute. In McCairn's video you see a similar ring on other
sides of the sample when he panned around the sample:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-gregblur-4.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said this about the image above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes - what you are seeing is consistent with the <strong>boundary
(periphery) of a dried biological droplet</strong>, such as a drop of
blood or plasma. Under fluorescence imaging with a dye like
<strong>Thioflavin T (ThT)</strong>, edges of dried droplets frequently
show <strong>brighter fluorescence than the interior</strong>. This
happens for a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Coffee-ring effect (solute accumulation at
edges):</strong> As a droplet dries, fluid flow drives solutes
(proteins, salts, fibrils, ThT, etc.) toward the perimeter. This causes
higher concentrations of material at the boundary, which in turn
enhances dye binding and fluorescence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased density of aggregates at the edge:</strong> If
the drop contains amyloidogenic proteins or fibrillar structures, they
often nucleate and accumulate preferentially near the drying front. ThT
binds more strongly in these regions, producing bright green
fluorescence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optical factors:</strong> At edges, the sample geometry

Ruby's anonymous embalmer Jennifer who was made sick by the clots</a>
</h2>
<p>In October 2022 Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Well, anyway,
one of those embalmers - and I will use her first name only, Jennifer,
with whom I've worked since July, board certified, highly experienced -
is now reporting a significant change in what she's observing. For now,
Jennifer wants to remain anonymous, and I don't have a problem with
that. I have fully vetted her, her credentials, her location, and her
work of which I have quite a compendium of pictures. Now, Jennifer is
not coming on camera. Not because she doesn't want to lose her job, but
because she has twin babies, whose lives she's trying to protect. And
also because she is their only parent and caregiver, no extended family.
Her findings have been consistent with those of numerous other embalmers
with whom I've spoken and with whom I've worked. What Jennifer is now
reporting, and this is, to my knowledge, a worldwide exclusive, at least
that an embalmer coming forward with it, is that some of the white
fibrous clots that she's pulling out of cadavers, and particular
cadavers, not just across the board. In order to proceed with her
embalming process, our making her feel ill.Â She says this has never
happened before. It's a new finding."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1pobq5-live-7pm-exclusive-white-clots-making-embalmers-sick.html?start=252>https://rumble.com/v1pobq5-live-7pm-exclusive-white-clots-making-embalmers-sick.html?start=252</a>]
Then she said: <span class="quote">"So these clots that she's pulling
out of specific or individual cadavers compared to many others, are
making her and her staff feel immediately ill with nausea, vomiting, and
weakness. Now, if those deceased people are getting something new and
different in their shots, this could be an explanation. Let's take a
look at one of her most recent clots that produced this experience. This
would be picture one, and I call this the large clot for my
producer."</span> And she showed this photo of a clot that unusually had
small white fibers attached to it:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-jennifer-large.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Jennifer is probably the same anonymous embalmer whose photos Jane
Ruby showed in June 2022, because in a video where Jane Ruby showed the
photos, she said: <span class="quote">"A second embalmer came forward,
but she wants to remain anonymous because she has small
children."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1bvwbf-dr.-jane-delivers-powerful-speech-dr.-zelenko-embalmers-blood-clots-and-mor.html?start=544>https://rumble.com/v1bvwbf-dr.-jane-delivers-powerful-speech-dr.-zelenko-embalmers-blood-clots-and-mor.html?start=544</a>]</p>
<p>Another interesting thing Jane Ruby said during the same video was
that she was already interviewed by Epoch Times in January 2022: <span
class="quote">"I was first interviewed by Epoch Times in January. I
think I've told this story before. They held on publishing the story
after they interviewed me, and the first embalmer that came forward,
Richard Hirschman. And they told me it was because the editor felt some
people in the office had been jabbed, and they didn't want to offend
them. [...] Then they came out around later this year. They did the entire
story with Hirschman, with the clots, with the analysis done by Mike
Adams, which I connected Hirschman with, and never mentioned me at all.
Ok, Epoch Times."</span> [7:32] I haven't found any reference to the
calamari clots before January 26th 2022 UTC when Ruby first interviewed
Hirschman. So if she was right about the date when she was interviewed
by Epoch Times, then it's interesting that the newspaper of a UFO cult
would've interviewed her within a few days from when she first broke the
story about the clots.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby said that her first mentor was Ken McClenton.

He ran a media network called TECN, which used to host Ruby's show
before she went on the Stew Peters Network. Many of the newest videos on
TECN's YouTube channel are advertisements for NTD TV, which is run by

embalmers interviewed by a news site from Alabama</a>
</h2>
<p>In September 2022 an Alabama news site called 1819 News published a
story about the clots, which said:
[<a href=https://1819news.com/news/item/embalmer-discovers-over-100-cases-of-strange-clots-in-people-since-release-of-covid-19-vaccine>https://1819news.com/news/item/embalmer-discovers-over-100-cases-of-strange-clots-in-people-since-release-of-covid-19-vaccine</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in March, 1819 News reached out to Darren Dunn of Services
Corporations International at their Birmingham hub. Dunn is the managing
embalmer of a facility that processes the highest volume of cases in the
state. Dunn said the increase in coagulation and strange blood clots
during embalming has become noticeable and undeniable to him and others
working there. That change first started around the time that the
COVID-19 virus erupted in the state. He says it has not slowed down in
frequency since 2020.</p>
<p>Dennis Russell works as an embalmer in St.Â Clair County and says he
does not see any uptick in strange blood clots. We spoke with him in
June of 2022. Russell also works as the St.Â Clair County Coroner and
when asked if other embalmers in that county have tried to bring to his
attention any strange clotting cases, Russell said no, not at all.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>1819 News took time back in April to call, at random, funeral homes
here in Alabama. After actually getting ahold of embalmers on the phone
in Auburn, Bessemer, McCalla to ask about unusual clots, three said they
haven't noticed anything unusual, and haven't been looking for anything
unusual either.</p>
<p>An embalmer in Montgomery said he hasn't seen any unusual blood clots
unless that person has been on a ventilator before death. This embalmer
has only been at the job for a year.</p>
<p>A Huntsville embalmer said there have been some weird cases with
clots but nothing that rises above the usual, in his opinion.</p>

morticians Mike Vogiatzakis and Mike MacIver</a>
</h2>
<p>In April 2024 the Canadian National Citizens Inquiry published a
testimony of the funeral director Mike Vogiatzakis and embalmer Mike
MacIver, who work at a funeral home in Manitoba.
[<a href=https://voyagefuneralhomes.com/our-staff/>https://voyagefuneralhomes.com/our-staff/</a>]</p>
<p>At first MacIver said that he started to see large white fibrous
clots <span class="quote">"since the COVID thing"</span>, even though he
said he had occasionally seen them before COVID (which conflicts with
the testimony of other morticians who claim they only started to see the
clots in 2021): <span class="quote">"And I've been seeing a high
preponderance of these white fibrous clots since the COVID thing. And at
the offset of COVID - I consider myself a critical thinker and try to
disseminate the information as I see it - and right at the offset,
Theresa Tam was giving me some information that seemed to be
conflicting. And then soon after that, the message was politicized.
Prime Minister Trudeau was up there, Pallister government was up there,
and I become highly suspect of some of the information that was being
presented to us at the public at large. And, so I started to look in
terms of my profession at what I was seeing in the way of COVID. And I
was seeing, you know, these white fibrous clots, you know, over the
years I've seen them occasionally, but almost with every single
embalming, I would see these large clots."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v2ifvvo-dual-funeral-industry-testimony-reveals-abnormalities-winnipeg-day-1-nation.html?start=1217>https://rumble.com/v2ifvvo-dual-funeral-industry-testimony-reveals-abnormalities-winnipeg-day-1-nation.html?start=1217</a>]
He also said: <span class="quote">"I seem to see a strong correlation
of, you know, from the COVID thing to these clots, and I can't explain
why."</span></p>
<p>Then the counsel who interviewed MacIver asked: <span
class="quote">"Are you saying that you started to see these clots in
2020 before the advent of the vaccines?"</span> [23:41] But MacIver
answered: <span class="quote">"Well, just prior to 2020, St.Â Boniface
Hospital had a high respiratory - they had a high incidence of flu. And
they had this unknown thing circulating. It wasn't defined as COVID at
that point. And then a few months later, in around the end of March of
2020, you know, they put down the restrictions and all those sorts of
things. And then shortly thereafter, the implemented, they fast tracked
some of these vaccines. And I think AstraZeneca was one of the first and
there was a lot of, you know, especially in Europe, they seemed to
purport that there was a lot of, you know, people suffering strokes and
heart attacks and all these sorts of things. And so it was shortly
thereafter where I started seeing more incidents of these clots."</span>
So it still wasn't clear if he started to see the clots in 2020, 2021,
or even 2019.</p>
<p>However later the counsel again asked: <span class="quote">"Can you
recall even the month that you started seeing these?"</span> [27:46] And
MacIver replied: <span class="quote">"That would probably be more
towards May, June. Because we were kind of restricted in -."</span> Then
the counsel interrupted him and asked: <span class="quote">"Of which
year? May, June, of which year?"</span> But again MacIver didn't answer,
and he continued: <span class="quote">"We were restricted in what we
could do at the funeral home originally. You know, they limited, you
know, the capacity of the funeral to like five people at one point. And
then Mike was getting very frustrated with the rules and regulations,
and seeing all the heartache and heartbreak out there, where he just
said, <span class="quote">'Let's just do it.'</span> You know, the - the
pardon, a better term to hell with these government officials and their
-."</span> Then the counsel asked him again: <span class="quote">"I
mean, a pressure one more time. Was it May or June of 2021 or 2022 or
2020?"</span> But MacIver said: <span class="quote">"Yeah, it would have
been in around 2021."</span></p>
<p>Earlier when MacIver described when he started seeing the clots, it
seemed like he was talking about events in 2020. It also seemed weird
how the counsel had to ask four times what year MacIver saw the clots
until MacIver answered.</p>
<p>In 2022 Hirschman said he started to see the clots in mid-2021, but
he later changed his story to say he started to see the clots in early
2021. In 2022 several other morticians also claimed that they started to
see the clots in mid-2021.</p>
<p>In 2024 an embalmer called Bill told Steve Kirsch: <span
class="quote">"I had never ever seen this - prior to, I'm gonna say July
or August of 2021."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v4calhh-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html?start=1872>https://rumble.com/v4calhh-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html?start=1872</a>]
Kirsch also asked the embalmer Lorin Ware <span class="quote">"And you
started seeing them in mid-2021?"</span> But she answered <span
class="quote">"Yes sir"</span>, and then Kirsch asked: <span
class="quote">"Was it like a light switch turning on, or did it happen
pretty gradually?"</span> And she answered that <span class="quote">"It
was like a light switch turning on."</span> [time 26:00]</p>
<p>But if the clots were caused by vaccines, and if the vaccines were
rolled out around the same time in different US states and in Canada,
then why did some embalmers in the US and Canada only start to see the
clots in mid-2021, but other embalmers started to see the clots in early
2021?</p>
<hr />
<p>National Citizens Inquiry Canada later hosted a video discussion that
featured Mike Vogiatzakis, Mike MacIver, and Laura Jeffery.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v4empqz-live-with-nci-a-round-table-discussion-with-dr.-mark-trozzi-and-leading-exp.html>https://rumble.com/v4empqz-live-with-nci-a-round-table-discussion-with-dr.-mark-trozzi-and-leading-exp.html</a>]</p>
<p>At time 15:17 Vogiatzakis said he saw few extra deaths in 2020-2021,
apart from suicides and drug overdoses which he attributed on the
lockdowns: <span class="quote">"And this whole thing has caused an
uproar of suicides and drug overdoses. And I could tell you that those
two years when he said that death rate was higher, it was lower than
normally. It's the only difference is it rose a bit because of all the
suicides and drug overdoses we were doing. And it was so bad that we
couldn't even keep up with the suicides and drug overdoses. And that was
a real problem. And it continues to be a problem. And I think they
really did a terrible thing to this world, and I think people are going
to be suffering for many years to come because of what the government
did, and how they lock people up."</span> Suicides and drug overdoses
were also elevated in the US in 2021, but deaths with underlying cause
related to suicide or drug overdose only accounted for about 3% of total
deaths in the US in 2021:
<code>t=fread("curl -Ls sars2.net/f/vital.csv.xz|xz -dc");t[,sum(ucd[cause%like%"X4[0-4]|X[67]|X8[0-4]|Y1[0-4]"])/sum(ucd)]</code>.
So even if the number of suicides and drug overdoses would've doubled to
6% of total deaths, it would've hardly caused trouble for a funeral home
to keep up with all the deaths.</p>
<p>Laura Jeffery claimed that he spoke to a gas station who had COVID in
November 2019, because he had worked with military members who had been
to Wuhan: <span class="quote">"And I also spoke to a guy during the
whole essential worker thing. I was at the gas station in the middle of
the night, and I kind of looked over and I said, <span
class="quote">'Essential worker?'</span> And he goes, <span
class="quote">'Yeah.'</span> And I said, <span
class="quote">'Oh,'</span> I said, <span class="quote">'I think I had it
in January.'</span> And he goes, <span class="quote">'Oh, I had it last
November.'</span> And I said, <span class="quote">'Well, how'd you
manage that?'</span> And he says, <span class="quote">'Well, I worked
with military members and they had just been over to Wuhan'</span>, and
he said, <span class="quote">'Yeah, it's really nasty. It stuck around
my way from my daughter and our household for quite a
while.'</span>"</span> [22:45]</p>
<p>Sasha Latypova says that when she got COVID, it was definitely a
neurotoxin poisoning: <span class="quote">"I had the covid illness, it
was definitely a neurotoxic poisoning, quote nasty"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1818292872569106655>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1818292872569106655</a>]
At time 22:08 Laura Jeffery similarly said that COVID was like a
neurotoxin poisoning: <span class="quote">"I also personally got really
sick for three days, the beginning of January, and subsequently I've had
Dr.Â Pilloch test me for antibodies, so that was January of 2020. And I
felt like I had been poisoned. It was like a neurotoxin for me."</span>
Laura Jeffery also tweeted: <span class="quote">"I had covid before it
was cool, 1st week for January 2020. Felt like a neurotoxin, awake
sleeping hellscape for 4 days, the bathroom trip was a safari, my body
fought like a tiger. Back to work the next day, sluggish for 2 months.
Doc Pelech confirmed."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1911221873045622937>https://x.com/LauraJayJayJay/status/1911221873045622937</a>]
The first COVID case in Canada was reported on January 25th.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that so many people in alt media would be early
COVID survivors, including Steve Pieczenik who claims that he was the
first case of COVID in the United States, and Kevin McCairn who claims
that he got COVID from the Korean superspreader event in November or
December 2019, even though the superspreader event only occurred in
February 2020.</p>
<p>At time 54:08 Vogiatzakis said that he only saw the first calamari
clot in 2022: <span class="quote">"And there's been some video evidence
that I've taken, where you've seen almost a variety of all those clots
in one, including the white fibrous clots that we're talking about and
are seeing more and more more often now. And don't forget, my first
blood clot I saw was in 2022, where I actually got to see one where Mike
called me in and he goes, <span class="quote">'Hey, you got to really
see that. This is totally different than I've ever seen before.'</span>
And I had video evidence, I literally got in there and videotaped the
clots coming out of the of the jugular vein. And to the point where we
were doing a restricted embalming because there was a lack of
movement."</span> Mike MacIver didn't mention anything about how he had
earlier claimed he started to see the clots around May or June of
2021.</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion hosted by NCI Canada, Laura Jeffery
thanked Mike MacIver for testifying to NCI Canada, and she said: <span
class="quote">"Mike MacIver, you were like the biggest, most wonderful
surprise for me. Because you - you're like the second Canadian that came
out and talked about what we were seeing when we were preparing people's
bodies, right?"</span> [1:27:45] Mike MacIver testified to NCI Canada in
April 2023. But if the calamari clots have been found in a large
percentage of dead bodies since 2021, why did it take over two years
from the vaccine rollout until the second person from Canada said that
they had seen the clots?</p>
<p>The first Canadian mortician who claimed to have seen the clots may
have actually been the pseudonymous funeral home director Carolyn. Her
testimony was featured in an article that was published by Epoch Times
in September 2023, which was after Mike MacIver testified to NCI Canada,
even though a draft version of the article had been posted to Google
Docs in 2022.

shouldn't be counted.</p>

Times article from September 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>In September 2022 Epoch Times published an article about the clots
that included comments by Mike Adams, Richard Hirschman, Wade Hamilton,
Wallace Hooker, Anna Foster, Larry Mills, two anonymous morticians,
James Thorp, and Sherri Tenpenny.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220907091600/https:/www.theepochtimes.com/embalmers-have-been-finding-numerous-long-fibrous-clots-that-lack-post-mortem-characteristics_4696015.html>https://web.archive.org/web/20220907091600/https:/www.theepochtimes.com/embalmers-have-been-finding-numerous-long-fibrous-clots-that-lack-post-mortem-characteristics_4696015.html</a>]</p>
<p>Richard Hirschman now claims that he started seeing the clots in
early 2021, even though in 2022 Hirschman and other morticians claimed
that they started seeing the clots in mid-2021. One of the two anonymous
morticians interviewed by Epoch Times said they started seeing the clots
around mid-2021, and the other anonymous mortician said she started to
see <span class="quote">"thick blood"</span> in May 2021, even though
she didn't explicitly say when she started to see the new type of
clots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other funeral directors or embalmers wanted to maintain anonymity,
because they don't know how the funeral houses would react.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"I can tell you with certainty that the clots
Richard has shown online are a phenomenon that I have not witnessed
until probably the middle of last year. That is pretty much all I have
to say about it. I have no knowledge as to what is causing the clots,
but they did seemingly start showing up around the middle of
2021,"</span> another embalmer, licensed since around 2001, told The
Epoch Times.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"You can rest assured that the clots we are
seeing are not something we ever saw prior to last year,"</span> he
added.</p>
<p>A licensed funeral director and apprentice embalmer who has been in
the funeral industry for over 3 years has participated in over 200
embalmings.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"During May of 2021, the embalming process became
more difficult. The normal draining of the blood was almost halted by
thick, jelly-like blood. Instead, of the blood flowing normally down the
table, it was very viscous. So thick, that it would not wash down the
table without assistance,"</span> she told The Epoch Times.</p>
<p>As time has passed since the vaccines were distributed she has seen
more of the <span class="quote">"thick blood"</span> as well as <span
class="quote">"thick, fibrous-like clots."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same anonymous mortician claimed that she herself, her father,
and her mother all had severe medical complications following
vaccination, which seems hard to believe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"Many families have reported their loved one's
death as a sudden heart attack, embolisms, and blood clots. Many
families have stated, that their family members had no health issues
prior to receiving the vaccine. I myself am vaccinated, as well as my
parents. My father was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, two weeks
later he had emergency surgery for blood clots in his popliteal artery.
After his second vaccine dose, he was hospitalized with more clots, he
had surgery a second time, and the third time he almost died. My father
had to have a complete bypass in his leg,"</span> she said.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"During my father's hospitalization, my best
friend's father was having emergency surgery at the same hospital for a
massive heart attack, which he suffered weeks after receiving his
vaccine."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"My father now suffers from nerve damage and loss
of usage in his leg. After my mother received her Moderna vaccine, she
has suffered complications of heart valve failure, and surgery for blood
clots in her arteries. I have been diagnosed, with pericardial effusion
of the tricuspid valve and I also have myocarditis. I started having
sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, and it has progressively become
worse. I went to the emergency room and followed up with a cardiologist,
who diagnosed me. My blood pressure is at an all-time high. I was a very
healthy person until I received the Moderna vaccine,"</span> she
added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epoch Times also interviewed James Thorp, who had an unusual
explanation for the formation of the clots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"The COVID-19 vaccine diverts energy away from
the physiologic processes in the body towards the production of the
toxic spike protein,"</span> Thorp said. <span class="quote">"This
directs energy away from the normal process of internal digestion also
known as autophagy. This results in protein misfolding and propagation
of large intravascular blood clots and also a variety of related
diseases including prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
amyloidosis, and dementias including Alzheimer's and others. While it is
possible that COVID-19 illness in itself could potentially contribute to
these diseases, it is unlikely and if so the effect of the vaccine would
be 100- to 1,000-fold greater than that of COVID-19 disease."</span></p>

<p>James Thorp is a member of the Chief Medical Board of The Wellness
company, whose co-founder is an anti-terrorism expert who works for

[<a href=https://beyondthemaze.substack.com/p/the-wellness-company>https://beyondthemaze.substack.com/p/the-wellness-company</a>]</p>
<p>The Epoch Times article included comments by Wade Hamilton and Sherri
Tenpenny, who both said that the clots might be caused by a buildup of
amyloid protein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hamilton thinks that the overwhelming accumulation of these strings
that have <span class="quote">"nearly the strength of steel"</span>
could have caused multi-organ failure and death.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"The term amyloid has previously been employed to
describe a number of pathological conditions in diseased organs and is
the cause of death in the rare genetic condition amyloidosis. It is
never normal. Whether a partial accumulation of thousands of the
string-like structures can cause fatigue based on decreased blood flow,
brain fog, or sudden adult death is speculative, but certainly
possible,"</span> Hamilton said.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"The pathologists will need to do more detailed
examinations than are routinely done to answer this question. This
process, for example, could lead to an acute myocardial infarction with
enzyme elevation in a young soccer player with no gross anatomical
findings."</span></p>
<p>Dr.Â Sherri Tenpenny, who has been analyzing vaccine adverse reactions
for about three decades, also thinks the clots have to do with amyloid
proteins.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"It appears the answer is coming directly through
that needle. Spike protein disease, leading to the deposition of amyloid
in organs and filling up arteries and veins,"</span> Tenpenny told The
Epoch Times.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"The spike protein also interacts with platelets
and fibrinogen, interfering with blood flow, also leading directly to
hypercoagulation. When the spike protein was mixed with other blood
proteins, the combined amyloid-like structure was resistant to the
enzymes that would normally break down the clot (called impaired
fibrinolysis),"</span> she added.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"This leads to the persistence of a voluminous
number of microclots in small blood vessels throughout the body called
capillaries. Millions of these tiny clots effectively block the passage
of red blood cells into tissues, decreasing oxygen exchange and leading
to multiorgan system failure."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wade Hamilton lost his medical license in 2024, because he told his
patient that it would be unsafe to enter an MRI machine because the
patient was vaccinated and vaccines contained <span
class="quote">"magnets and heavy metals"</span>.

Sherri Tenpenny's medical license was suspended after several complaints
regarding her speech to the Ohio House Health Committee, where she
claimed that vaccinated people were magnetic and vaccines created an
interface to 5G towers.

<p>All videos of Wade Hamilton I found on Rumble were interviews he did
on the Stew Peters Network.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/search/video?q=%22wade+hamilton%22>https://rumble.com/search/video?q=%22wade+hamilton%22</a>]
In one of the videos Hamilton told Stew that if a COVID vaccine is given

able to have sperm"</span>.

He also said that vaccines contain quantum dots, and he talked about an
Expose News article which said that vaccinated children were 4423% more
likely to die than unvaccinated children.</p>
<p>The author of the Epoch Times article was Enrico Trigoso, who became
a practicioner of Falun Gong in 2010:

O'Looney interviewed by Maria Zeee in July 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>In July 2022 which was about a month after O'Looney first started
saying he had seen calamari clots, he said that the white clots were
first brought to his attention by Hirschman.</p>
<p>Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"I saw you recently holding up a
jar that looks consistent with other findings from the likes of Dr.Â Jane
Ruby and Mike Adams, you know, looking at these fibrous - what we would
say would clots - but they're not clots, are they?"</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1c8w03-john-olooney-hospitals-are-covering-up-baby-deaths-by-cremating-babies-them.html?start=199>https://rumble.com/v1c8w03-john-olooney-hospitals-are-covering-up-baby-deaths-by-cremating-babies-them.html?start=199</a>]
Then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"No, no. So, these were
deaths with first - I kind of noticed something along those lines, about
12 months, 14 months ago, where my embalmer was complaining that he was
finding people that were coming in - would be difficult, difficult to
embalm. Because they were blocked up, you know, usually can make an
incision in the carotid artery, pop the pump in, tie it off and then
pump fluid throughout the body, but he's struggling to do that. Because
the system - well, we thought initially the pump was needed servicing.
But it's not that at all, it's the system in these people, it is choked
up with this white fibrous-like substance. Now, this was brought to my
attention by a guy called Richard Hirschman, who's an American-based
embalmer, he's a trade embalmer, who was very open about it, and he's
been warning people, as many people as will listen, and showing pictures
of it. And we kind of had a suspicion that's what it was inside people.
But we had a young lad in - who will remain nameless - a couple of weeks
ago, who is - members of his family told me had been jabbed. And he'd
had a post-mortem, and we were asked to embalm him. When we've embalmed
in, we've opened his cavity up to locate those severed arteries that
were cut during the embalming - the post-mortem process - to connect the
pump to. And lo and behold, all of these arteries are full of this white
- it resembles - very strongly resembles, like calamari, it's like a
sinewy fibrous, very elastic - and it was virtually filling all of these
major arteries, significantly, you know, between sort of 30, 40, 50, to
80%, you know. And I suspect that's probably what's killed him, looking
at the state of these arteries."</span></p>
<p>So supposedly O'Looney's funeral home had embalmed bodies with
calamari clots since mid-2021, but O'Looney didn't see the clots for the
first time until June 2022. It doesn't make any sense, and it's one of
the best pieces of evidence I have found that the clots are fake.</p>
<p>I presume O'Looney learned about the clots from the videos Hirschman
did in alt media, because at time 13:12 he said: <span class="quote">"So
we kind of knew what we were going to find after watching Richard
Hirschman and his findings, and I've spoken to Richard Hirschman several
times since."</span> In February 2022 Hirschman said that O'Looney was
one of his heroes, and he first saw a video by O'Looney around
September, October, or November of 2021.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vucdbi-embalmer-richard-hirschman-reveals-novel-clotting-in-65-of-cases.html?start=1850>https://rumble.com/vucdbi-embalmer-richard-hirschman-reveals-novel-clotting-in-65-of-cases.html?start=1850</a>]
But I don't remember Hirschman or O'Looney saying that they were in
contact before Hirschman started speaking out in alt media.</p>
<p>At time 15:12 O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"So I've been
hearing through the grapevine within the industry that there are lots
and lots of babies dying in unprecedented numbers. I saw the testimony
of a funeral director a couple of months ago called Wesley. I've spoken
to Wesley. He is a funeral director - can supply you with that
testimony. And he mentions going into these hospitals, and the
pediatrics being so full they're putting these babies on trays in the
adult section, because there's not enough room for them. Now, I couldn't
understand as a funeral director why my phone wasn't ringing for any of
these parents. I haven't had any calls from any parents who've lost a
baby. And then we went to the premises last week. And there's an
information board in the waiting room, and it lists the name of the
deceased, the time of the service, and who is the funeral director. And
they all scroll past, and it's just general information publicly
available. And we saw baby names on there. And the baby names had Milton
Keynes University Hospital, the local hospital, as the funeral director.
Now I've never known that happen before. Certainly I've never seen their
name on the board in the years I've been going there, until recently.
And today we went down there, there was another one on there. Anyway, we
got speaking to a member of staff at crematorium who will remain
nameless - and because that's up to them to speak - and he told us that
they're bringing in babies from the hospital directly, six and eight at
a time. You know, in numbers that I've certainly never knew were
happening, you know. And of course, if they're going from the hospital
direct to the crematorium, it's being kept quiet isn't it? You know,
they're cutting out - they're usually - somebody will lose a child, the
bereavement would then point them towards source and a funeral director.
Clearly they're not doing that now, the hospital are going directly, and
that's going on the information board as they are the funeral director.
I've never known that before, and this guy told us that they're coming
in six and eight at a time. How true that is? I really don't know. Would
that correlate with what Wesley the funeral director said a couple of
months ago? Certainly would, and I'm happy to supply him - forward you
that interview."</span> Next O'Looney said: <span class="quote">"I know
these numbers are going up significant, because I've been told by more
than one person within the industry - and the phone isn't ringing, and
this is obviously why. The hospital now go directly with the
crematorium. Is that a new development? Obviously it is."</span> At time
20:13 he said: <span class="quote">"We had that contract exclusively. We
never picked up babies in any kind of number like that, you know. Maybe
one or two three a month. Because babies don't generally die, you know,
in numbers. It's - it's, yeah - so if they're really are going to the
crematorium directly from the hospital six and eight at a time, clearly
something is very very very wrong."</span> O'Looney also wondered if
parents were offered hush money by the government, which might have
explained why parents weren't speaking out about their babies dying.</p>
<p>It seems like O'Looney modified his story over time based on what
other people were saying in alternative media. After Hirschman started
to say that he saw the white clots, O'Looney had to come up with an
excuse for why he hadn't earlier mentioned the white clots. And after
Wesley said there were ten times the normal number of babies dying,
O'Looney came up with a reason for why other people weren't speaking
about a massive number of deaths in babies.</p>

<p>Monali Rahalkar retweeted the tweet by Greg shown here, so I informed

<p>In the last tweet above, Billy Bostickson said he had told me on DM

I had forgotten about the DM.</p>
<p>There's videos where Greg claimed he was a member of DRASTIC at some
point, but I don't know if he still claims to be in DRASTIC. He has also
suggested he was part of DRASTIC in some tweets:

<p>Greg's AI said that I shifted focus from his <span
class="quote">"full mRNA/plasmid construct analysis"</span> to <span
class="quote">"only spike protein sequence windows"</span>. And it said
this about me to Greg: <span class="quote">"Implied you misrepresented
SARS-CoV-2 ORFs when it is their misrepresentation of your
mRNA/plasmid-derived ORF work."</span> So is the AI now saying that
Greg's ORFs are ORFs of an mRNA vaccine and not the virus? Greg's AI
also said that I correctly stated that ORF10 was 38 amino acids long.
But that's the ORF10 of the virus and not an mRNA vaccine. The same
table by Greg which said ORF10 was 38 aa long also said that ORF11 was
35 aa long, ORF19 was 75 aa long, and ORF29 was 60 aa long, which made
it seem like they were all ORFs of the virus and not a vaccine, and the
text below the table said that the table showed <span
class="quote">"SARS-CoV-2 ORF peptides"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528/photo/2>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528/photo/2</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-orfcontent.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>I have shown that I can't find ORFs in any 6 frames of Wuhan-Hu-1
that match the length or amino acid percentages of Greg's ORFs. Greg's
AI now said it was because his ORFs employ <span
class="quote">"alternative translation initiation"</span>, which
presumbaly means alternative start codons. The AI said: <span
class="quote">"ORFs 11, 19, and 29 are hidden within frames not normally
translated - their expression becomes possible when using synthetic mRNA
constructs with alternative translation initiation."</span> But even
then, there wouldn't be any 60 aa segment of either SARS-CoV-2 or the
mRNA vaccine sequences that would have 50% Q and N residues.</p>
<p>Greg's AI told him that I <span class="quote">"posted new baiting
data after your formal polite disengagement (<span
class="quote">'adieu'</span>)"</span>, which referred to this tweet that
Greg posted when he blocked me:
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1920385383092588724>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1920385383092588724</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ccp10-6.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>But I'm not going to stop exposing Greg as a fraud simply because he
blocks me, especially if he keeps attacking me from behind a block. And
I have done a lot of work collecting evidence that the clots are a hoax,
but Greg's posts are so ridiculous that they are one of the best sources
of evidence I have found.</p>

<p>In one video she said: <span class="quote">"When I'm embalming, I see
a lot of blood clots, and have done long before the COVID vaccine. So
blood clots aren't new thing. And if we say fibrous thick white blood
clots, I've had many of them many years ago, and spoke to embalmers from
years ago. There's a lot of diseases that people die of that will
inevitably have blood clots in their system when we embalm."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0i9M0Nbls&start=51s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0i9M0Nbls&amp;start=51s</a>]
She also said: <span class="quote">"No, I haven't seen more since the
vaccine. I haven't experienced them being harder, wider, firmer, or
anything like that. Just the regular normal clots that we get."</span>
And she said: <span class="quote">"I am never going to know if that
person who's passed away has ever had any kind of a vaccine."</span></p>
<p>The common pattern seems to be that people who are not linked to
shady alt media channels say they haven't seen calamari clots. The
people who claim they have seen calamari clots are frequently connected
to controlled opposition outlets in alt media, like SPN, Epoch Times,
VSRF, Vejon Health, InfoWars, Natural News, or NZDSOS.</p>

<p>Joe Sansone first fell under my radar because I noticed he did many
videos with people connected to calamari clots, like Andrew Zywiec,
Laura Kasner, Tom Haviland, and Richard Hirschman:

<p>The two earliest videos of Laura Kasner I found on Rumble were both
posted by Sansone. One of them was a video where she confronted the
Attorney General of Ohio, and the other was a video where Kasner and
Haviland were interviewed by Sansone:

<p>Sansone was also one of the first people who interviewed Andrew
Zywiec, and there's a semi-viral clip from the interview where Zywiec
presented Greg's mass spectrometry results of the clots:

<p>The earliest interview Sansone posted on his BitChute channel was an

<p>In 2023 Sansone was a speaker in a symposium held by Todd Callender's
organization VaxxChoice, which also featured David Meiswinkle, Ana
Mihalcea, Todd Callender (who said that the calamari clots are 5G
antennas), the DMED whistleblowers Theresa Long and Pete Chambers, the
Qtard lady Ann Vandersteel, and Jeffrey Prather who was the Chief of

<hr />
<p>In 2023 Sansone did an interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v2ys1ge-ban-the-jab-discussion-with-dr.-ana-mihalcea-and-dr.-joseph-sansone.html>https://rumble.com/v2ys1ge-ban-the-jab-discussion-with-dr.-ana-mihalcea-and-dr.-joseph-sansone.html</a>]
At time 26:25 Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"And what I mean in
terms of the transhumanist transformation of our entire biosphere is
they started using these, uh, the geoengineering stuff, the chemtrails,
and, uh, so where they were spraying metals and polymers, graphene
oxide, and we've been inhaling this stuff for a long time. And then with
the shots, they started injecting it into people. So now you have
literally a weapon of mass destruction that was injected into humans
that is self-assembling in nano swarms - these are nanorobotic quantum
dot crystals that are - that are self assembling to create these
filaments that eventually grow into these ginormous clots. Richard
Hirschman sent me some, they were as long as 33 inches."</span> But
Sansone just kept nodding and saying <span
class="quote">"uh-huh"</span>, and he didn't have anything critical to
say.</p>
<p>At time 31:44 Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"And what I'm seeing
is self-assembling nano robotics that's self-learning and artificially
alive. And so this - I have looked at blood that was embalmed by
somebody - who was dead for over eight months. And this stuff continues
to replicate. The shedding process never stops even after death, because
the production of the nanotechnology - the replication doesn't stop. Uh,
we have found these filaments."</span> But Sansone just nodded and said
<span class="quote">"wow"</span>.</p>
<p>At time 33:53 Sansone asked: <span class="quote">"Do you think the
blood clots - what you said were these biosynthetic blood clots - do you
believe that they're being created on purpose? Or is that just an
adverse reaction to an ongoing experiment to see how to create these
biosynthetic bodies?"</span> But Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"So
remember when Ronald Reagan said, you know, what would happen - would
humanity unite if you were attacked by an alien race? So imagine, to me
this stuff is like an alien life form. Alien meaning it shouldn't be in
your body. And it's parasitic in the sense that it literally will
assimilate the host."</span> And Sansone said <span
class="quote">"Feeding off your energy."</span> And Mihalcea said <span
class="quote">"Feeding off the energy until you're either a cyborg or
you drop dead."</span> And Sansone said: <span class="quote">"Right.
Right. And so we're going with the idea that they're trying to create
some type of synthetic framework that they can house their
consciousness. These billionaires don't want to die."</span></p>
<p>At time 45:29 Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"So I believe that
what different groups are calling graphene oxide is actually hydrogel
self-assembling, but it has carbon nanotubes in it, and it uses it, you
know, to create these devices. But the actual ribbon - so what we - we
had isolated from the blood - these filaments, and did near-infrared
spectroscopy, which looks at functional groups - and what it was were
polyamides and polyvinyl alcohol. So these are plastics that create
hydrogel."</span> But Sansone just nodded and said <span
class="quote">"uh-huh"</span>.</p>

<p>In 2023 the Dutch lawyer Arno van Kessel sued 17 defendants, who
included Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Albert Bourla, Ursula von der Leyen,
and the former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. The five expert
witnesses in the case were Catherine Austin Fitts, Sasha Latypova,
Katherine Watt, Mike Yeadon, and Joe Sansone.</p>
<p>In 2021 van Kessel said that people with two doses won't live longer
than 5 years, and he also said that vaccines contain graphene oxide and
nanotechnology, and that vaccines turn humans into half robots and
enable Bill Gates to remote control people:

translated]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel believes that Bill Gates will control us remotely through
the vaccines. <span class="quote">"Honestly, believe me, I'm not a fool.
We're going to be controlled remotely. Everyone who gets that shot is
going to be screwed. You'll become half robot, half human. That's what
happens with nanotechnology, and nanotechnology exists. The patents are
real. If you had told me this two years ago, I would have said: you're
crazy. But after all the research we've done... I'm not crazy. I'm a
lawyer."</span></p>
<p>Gates has never said he wants to kill the world's population with
vaccines. But Van Kessel insists. He claims the nanomaterial graphene
oxide, an often-debunked conspiracy theory, is in the vaccines to kill
people. <span class="quote">"If you've had two shots, I'm convinced you
won't live longer than five years. And you do nothing about
it."</span></p>

<p>In 2024 Joseph Sansone filed a court case seeking to prohibit the
distribution of mRNA vaccines in Florida.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/breaking-florida-lawsuit-seeks-injunction>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/breaking-florida-lawsuit-seeks-injunction</a>]
Sansone blamed shedding from vaccines on why he needed to have a triple
bypass heart surgery, but he didn't supply any evidence for his
claim:</p>

<p>Later Sansone stated it as a fact that he had been harmed by
shedding:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>In an interview with Todd Callender, Sansone said: <span
class="quote">"I invoked the Florida Civil Rights Act, because I'm
saying - and I used my telebrief - I'm saying that even if you don't
believe I was injured by the shedding - if I can't prove that, beacuse
we don't have like a quntitative spike protein test out there yet that
would so that yet - so, it doesn't matter. Because I have a right to
public accommodation under the Florida Civil Rights Act. I have a
pre-existing heart condition here. And so I have a right to, like, go
into my office without having a fear of people shedding on me if they're
getting boosters and that kind of thing. So I'm arguing that in my
case."</span>

<p>Earlier when Sansone filed an emergency petition seeking to ban COVID
vaccines Florida in 2024, he went on Maria Zeee's show together with
Karen Kingston to discuss the petition.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/karen-kingston-and-dr-joseph-sansone>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/karen-kingston-and-dr-joseph-sansone</a>]</p>
<p>Sansone stated that the crimes committed against Floridians included
terrorism, treason, murder, and genocide:

<p>In the court documents Sansone wrote about hydrogel and calamari
clots in the same paragraph, so he seems to have supported Mihalcea's
view that the clots are made of hydrogel, because he cited two of
Mihalcea's videos as his sources. He said that vaccines contain hydrogel
which is programmable matter, and he wrote that the calamari clots are
<span class="quote">"biosynthetic blood clots"</span>:

<p>In 2024 National ARM posted a video discussion of their board
members, who included David Meiswinkle, Ana Maria Mihalcea, Joe Sansone,
and Michael Diamond.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v53z69n-national-arm-board-member-discussion.html>https://rumble.com/v53z69n-national-arm-board-member-discussion.html</a>]
At time 26:33 Meiswinkle told Mihalcea: <span class="quote">"You have
the videos and the dark field, you can show that, you have the nanobots
in there, and you know the contents of it. And if more doctors that are
good doctors, like McCullough or Kory would get onboard and look at your
work - I think it's priceless - and that may be, you know, the
thunderbolt or lightning bolt to wake up the masses."</span> At time
46:00 Meiswinkle said that there's Morgellons filaments in both
chemtrails and vaccines: <span class="quote">"Now, as far as other
things that we're doing, the geoengineering is a big thing. Dr.Â Ana -
and I've mentioned Clifford Carnicom - who had done papers together -
and they found similarities, and I mean, those similarities, the exact
same thing in the work that Clifford's been doing on the spraying. [...]
They have filaments in there, and Morgellons filaments that could really
disable you. And they've been doing that for quite a while. It seems
that they've upped the ante by putting a lot of this stuff in
concentrated form in the vaccine, so that the people like Dr.Â Ana is
finding these giant hydrogels - or hydrogel filaments."</span></p>
<p>David Meiswinkle and Michael Diamond are both lawyers from New
Jersey, but I don't think Meiswinkle is a Jew, because he doesn't look
like a Jew, his father had a Christian funeral ceremony, his mother was
a member of a church choir, and his sister is named Christa.

both forms of the name have an estimated incidence of zero in Israel.
[<a href=https://forebears.io/surnames/meiswinkle>https://forebears.io/surnames/meiswinkle</a>]
Joe Sansone looks like a Middle Easterner, but I think he's just an
Italian, because Sansone is an Italian name which is very rare in Israel
according to Forebears.io.

<p>Another board member of National ARM is the Quantum Nurse Grace
Asagra, who is from New Jersey like Meiswinkle.
[<a href=https://nationalarm.org/board/>https://nationalarm.org/board/</a>]
One of the advisors to National ARM is J. Michael Springmann, who is a
former US State Department official who served as a diplomat in the US
Foreign Service, and who is now a lawyer who practices in the DC
area.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added in October 2025: Joe Sansone now broke the news that the
International Tribunal of the Alliance of Indigenous Nations had
declared that the COVID vaccines are bioweapons:
<a href=fake.html#Alliance_of_Indigenous_Nations_declares_that_COVID_vaccines_are_bioweapons>fake.html#Alliance_of_Indigenous_Nations_declares_that_COVID_vaccines_are_bioweapons</a>.
Their declaration looked similar to Sansone's complaint for his case in
Florida, and it featured expert statements from Ana Mihalcea, Andrew
Zywiec, Paul Alexander, and Rima Laibow, who all provided testimony to
Sansone's case. The declaration was signed by <span class="quote">"A.
Leaping Ram"</span>, who is the Attorney General of AIN. He is a white
sovereign citizenship guru called Glenn Bogue, who is also known as
Spirit Warrior, and who discovered his mÃ©tis identity late in life, when
he became a member of a fake Indian nation run by white sovereign
citizenship gurus, which allows anyone to become their member by paying
an annual fee of 300 CAD. A Leaping Ram has also written a book called
the <span class="quote">"Sacred Sex and the Menopausal Woman"</span>,
where he wrote that <span class="quote">"In her Holy of Holies (her
womb) the female is capable of producing the wondrous Ormus molecule,
which has the quantum capability to not only reverse disease and raise
intelligence; it can actually open the Stargate to the Universe!"</span>
A Leaping Ram says that humans were created 200,000 years ago, when a
female scientist from Planet X inserted sperm from Planet X into the egg
of a bonobo, and on her way to earth, she also happened to carve the
face on Mars. Another member of AIN is Alfred Lambremont Webre, who was
a judge in the International Tribunal for Natural Justice, and who has
his own fake tribunal called the <span class="quote">"Natural and Common
Law Tribunal for Public Health &amp; Justice"</span>. Webre wrote a book
with A Leaping Ram that was allegedly based on information leaked by
time travelers.</p>

people who have suggested that the calamari clots might be a psyop</a>
</h2>
<p>I have said for a long time that the calamari clots look like a
psyop, but I have found almost no other people who have said the same
thing, which is one of the reasons why I decided to write this series of
articles, I'm covering novel territory that has not been researched by
other people before me.</p>
<p>The standard line of fact checkers is that morticians mistake regular
post-mortem clots for calamari clots, even though it wouldn't make sense
why several morticians around the world would've started to
synchronously mistake regular post-mortem clots for a novel type of
rubbery clots in 2021, and to insist that the new clots are completely
different from regular post-mortem clots. But the fact checkers don't
consider the possibility that the morticians would be part of a
coordinated disinformation campaign and they would systematically lie
about seeing a new type of clots, which I think causes the fact checkers
to present an incorrect hypothesis about the nature of the clots.</p>
<p>In general mainstream people tend to view conspiracy theorists as
either opportunists who are motivated by profit or fame, or as gullible
fools, but mainstream people don't consider the possibility that a
conspiracy narrative would be born out of a coordinated disinformation
program.</p>
<p>Many people in the conspiracy movement have realized that the stories
about graphene oxide, hydras, and nanobots are disinformation, even
though for some reason few people have subjected the calamari clots to
the same kind of scrutiny.</p>
<p>When I used several sets of keywords to search for users on Twitter
who had said the clots were fake, I found a user called 767Aviatrix, who
had posted these tweets:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3A767Aviatrix+calamari&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3A767Aviatrix+calamari&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-aviatrix.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>I also found a user called MPraesenti94131, who told John O'Looney
that the clots were a psyop:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AMPraesenti94131+%28clot+OR+clots%29&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3AMPraesenti94131+%28clot+OR+clots%29&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-praesenti.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>I had a hard time finding other people on Twitter who would've said
the clots were a psyop or a hoax.</p>
<p>Jikkyleaks is one of the few Twitter users I have seen saying that
the clots might be a hoax. However he might have picked it up from me,
because the first time I found him saying it was in a reply to my tweet,

fake:

<p>When I compiled evidence that the clots are a hoax on Kevin McCairn's
Discord server, I got maybe one or two users to agree with me until I
got banned from the server. I'm writing this over 4 months after I
published the first article about the clots on my website, but so far I
don't think there's anyone who has read my articles, so I don't think my
website has convinced anyone that the clots are fake either.</p>
<p>I will expand this section later if I find more people who have said
that the clots are a hoax or a psyop.</p>

<p>Kevin McKernan found a 23 amino acid cryptic ORF within the SV40
promoter sequence that is included in the Pfizer vaccine plasmid:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-sv40cryptic-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Therefore his AI speculated that the ORF might result in the
formation of the white fibrous clots (which is reminiscent of Greg
Harrison's AI hallucinations about how the clots are caused by cryptic
ORFs):</p>

<p>AmyloGram allows entering up to 50 sequences at a time, so I
generated 50 random 23 aa segments of the protein coding sequences in
SARS-CoV-2:</p>
<pre>$ curl -s &#39;https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nucleotide&amp;rettype=fasta_cds_aa&amp;id=MN908947&#39;&gt;sars2.aa

[...]</pre>
<p>McKernan's cryptic ORF had an amyloid likelihood score of about
0.6667, but 14 of my 50 random segments got the same or higher amyloid
likelihood score:
[<a href=http://biongram.biotech.uni.wroc.pl/AmyloGram/>http://biongram.biotech.uni.wroc.pl/AmyloGram/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sv40cryptic-2.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>I also tried generating 50 random sequences of 23 amino acids:</p>
<pre>for i in {1..50};do printf %s\\n \&gt;$i $(tr -dc ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY&lt;/dev/random|head -c23);done</pre>
<p>But 9 out of 50 sequences got an amyloid likelihood score of 0.6667
or higher.</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2023 when McKernan searched UniProt BLAST for the long reverse ORF
in the Pfizer vaccine, the top match was a protein that was labeled as a
spider silk protein, even though it was actually a misannotated protein
from a bacterial sequencing dataset, and it was later removed from
UniProt. Jessica Rose wrote a long post about the reverse ORF, where she
made it seem like spider silk would actually be relevant to
understanding the ORF, but she didn't say the BLAST match was due to
chance, or that there were many other random proteins with a similarly
close match on BLAST. She also came up with a theory that the calamari
clots might be made of hydrogel formed by spider silk-like peptides, in
the same way that Bryan Ardis said that the clots are made of two snake
venom peptides in hydrogel.</p>
<p>However now Jessica Rose again said that McKernan's post about the
cryptic ORF was a <span class="quote">"great update"</span>, and she
didn't have anything negative to say about the post:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sv40cryptic-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<hr />
<p>The clots are like a mirror where people can see their pet topic, so
Christie Laura Grace says the clots are caused by LNPs, Geoffrey Norman
Pain says the clots are caused by endotoxin, and Bryan Ardis says the
clots are caused by snake venom. So it's not too surprising that Kevin
McKernan would now say that the clots might be caused by SV40
promoters.</p>
<p>McKernan previously also speculated that the clots might be caused by
plasmid DNA:
[<a href=https://x.com/Kevin_McKernan/status/1921652483706736654>https://x.com/Kevin_McKernan/status/1921652483706736654</a>]</p>

<p>The Substack author Bill Rice published a text-only interview of
Hirschman, where he wrote:
[<a href=https://billricejr.substack.com/p/my-visit-with-historys-most-important>https://billricejr.substack.com/p/my-visit-with-historys-most-important</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time he shared what he was seeing with the public was a
reply he made to someone else's post on Facebook.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"If you could see what I see in the embalming
room, you'd be concerned,"</span> he wrote.</p>
<p>A man in Cyprus, Greece (Andrew Clarke) picked up on Richard's
comment and the two men began sharing personal messages. In one of these
messages, Richard shared photos of the strange clots.</p>
<p>Clarke immediately sensed this visual evidence - if shared widely -
might shake up the world.</p>
<p>Richard agreed and, indeed, several of his closest colleagues in the
funeral business were now saying, <span class="quote">"Someone needs to
show this to the world."</span> But nobody did ... yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the Substack post didn't include a link to the Facebook
comment, and Facebook doesn't support searching for comments. I asked
Bill Rice to link to the comment, but he didn't reply.</p>
<p>The quoted part of the Facebook comment didn't even explicitly refer
to a new type of clots, so I don't know if the comment should be counted
as the first public reference to calamari clots. Even if the comment is
real, Hirschman may have originally referred to something else by his
comment, but he might have later lied and said he meant the clots.</p>
<p>As of now, I have not found even a single tweet or Facebook post that
would have referred to the clots before 2022.</p>

<p>In the comment section of Steve Kirsch's Substack, someone called
Lori told Tom Haviland: <span class="quote">"Hi Tom. I have a friend in
Boca Raton Florida who works in a funeral home and takes care of those
that have passed. I asked her specifically about these clots and how
many she has seen. She says none but I just can't believe her."</span>

Then when Tom Haviland suggested the friend was lying, Lori replied:
<span class="quote">"I do believe she is not telling the truth and it is
a sadness as she has been a good friend and I used to work with her. She
was always forthright. I have a feeling her boss(es) are telling her to
keep her mouth shut. I plan to ask her again in the next few
weeks."</span></p>
<p>A user on Twitter wrote: <span class="quote">"My own N=1 anecdote: a
friend of mine is an embalmer in Queens, NYC. He and I both think the
clot shot is poison. However he says he has never seen these calamari
clots and thinks they are totally fake. He does say deaths are up but
never seen these clots. Just my $0.02."</span>

<p>In August 2022 Cafe Locked Out interviewed a funeral director from
Tasmania, who talked about how there had been a large increase in deaths
in the past half year. But he didn't say anything about a new type of
white fibrous clots.
