<p>During an interview with Mary Holland from CHD, Ana Maria Mihalcea claimed that the calamari clots contained spider silk protein. She said: <span class="quote">"Clifford Carnicom and I have got the deceased clots from Richard Hirschman, we got a clot from a living vaccine injured person, and from an unvaccinated individual. And what we looked at is clearly this rubber-like material that we know about. And we did by mircoscopy, and we found the same filaments that we see in the blood, absolutely the same stuff, okay. And then we did near-infrared spectroscopy and found that these things have a polyenes, which is polyethylene alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, which is plastic, and polyamide, which is silk, nylon, or Kevlar. And specifically, you know, Kevin Kerningham, Dr. Kerningham [meant McKernan] found the genes of DNA of spidroins of spider silk. That's the strongest military-grade material that they have made. And so we found these in the clots."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970364993798325>https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970364993798325</a>, time 41:40]</p>
<p>However McKernan did not actually find a spidroin protein in the Pfizer vaccine sequence, but <span class="quote">"spidroin"</span> was a nickname he gave for the long open reading frame he found on the reverse strand of the Pfizer sequence. When he searched for the reverse ORF on UniProt BLAST using extremely liberal settings, the closest match happened to be a protein that was annotated as a spidroin by chance, even though it was an extremely distant match that had only about 25% identity, and it wasn't returned as a hit when he ran regular BLAST with the default settings: [<a href=https://anandamide.substack.com/p/spider-webs-in-the-pfizer-closet>https://anandamide.substack.com/p/spider-webs-in-the-pfizer-closet</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>The spidroin protein sequence was likely misannotated, and it was removed from UniProt in June 2024, so it is no longer even returned as a result if you do a BLAST match for the reverse ORF. But before it had been removed, I downloaded the Pfizer plasmid sequence that McKernan uploaded to GenBank, and I picked the longest ORF on the reverse strand:</p>

So now the spidroin protein only came on third place, but the best two matches were a protein from algae and a cockroach protein. But all of them had a poor match with only about 25% identity:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-spidroin-old.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>From the table above you can also see that the match to the misannotated spidroin protein has a length of 1,496 aa and about 24% identity, but the matches to the next 5 closest proteins have similar percentage identities around 25% and length around 500-4000 aa. The match to the spidroin has an E-value of about 1.3e-9, which is meant to indicate how many similarly close matches are expected to occur by chance. But in this case the E-value is clearly too low, which might be because the query sequence had an unusual distribution of amino acids because it was the reverse complement of a codon-optimized sequence, but the E-value was calculated using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix which assumed a natural distribution of amino acids.</p>

<li>You mentioned the ORF comes from a <strong>reversed codon-optimized sequence</strong>.</li>

<li>This can mimic <strong>spidroin-like sequences</strong> (which are glycine-rich) even though there is no functional homology.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Spider silk proteins (spidroins) and the reverse open reading frame (ORF) of the Pfizer plasmid exhibit similar amino acid compositions, but for entirely different reasons. In the case of spider silk, the biased amino acid composition is a result of evolutionary selection for mechanical properties such as strength, elasticity, and hydrophobicity. Spidroins are rich in glycine and alanine, which contribute to flexible and crystalline regions of the silk, respectively. Leucine and valine are also prominent, helping to stabilize hydrophobic interactions. Conversely, spidroins contain very low amounts of aromatic residues (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine) and polar charged residues, as these are not advantageous for the physical properties of silk fibers.</p>
<p>In contrast, the reverse ORF from the Pfizer plasmid is not a biologically meaningful protein. Its amino acid composition is an artifact that arises from codon optimization used to express the vaccine gene efficiently in human cells. Codon optimization increases the frequency of certain nucleotides, particularly guanine and cytosine, to match human codon usage preferences. When this optimized sequence is taken in reverse and read in an alternative frame, it produces a pseudo-protein sequence with an amino acid composition that reflects these underlying nucleotide biases rather than any functional protein-coding information.</p>
<p>As a result, the reverse ORF also shows a high abundance of glycine, alanine, leucine, and valine. This is because codons rich in guanine and cytosine frequently map to these amino acids when read in the reverse complement strand. Other residues like glutamine, aspartic acid, and histidine also appear with elevated frequencies due to similar codon artifacts. The similarity in amino acid composition between the spidroin and the reverse ORF is therefore coincidental, stemming from the statistical properties of the genetic code and the influence of codon optimization, rather than from any evolutionary relationship.</p>
<p>This convergence in amino acid composition leads to misleading BLAST results. BLAST scoring is affected not only by exact sequence identity but also by overall composition similarities. Consequently, even sequences with low identity can produce low E-values if their amino acid distributions are comparable. In this case, the reverse ORF's accidental resemblance to spidroin composition results in false-positive BLAST hits, despite the lack of true homology. This reflects a composition-driven artifact, not an indication of biological relatedness.</p>

<p>The spidroin protein is no longer returned as a match by UniProt. The protein was deleted from UniProt in June 2024 for the reason that that it was an <span class="quote">"excluded proteome"</span>: [<a href=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G1Y380/history>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G1Y380/history</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-spidroinexcluded.png width=800>
</div>
<p>UniProt says that reasons for excluding a proteome include incorrect assembly, contamination, or misidentification of the source organism. [<a href=https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_exclusion_reasons>https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_exclusion_reasons</a>]</p>
<p>The source organism of the protein at both UniProt and GenBank listed is a bacterium called <em>Nitrospirillum amazonense</em>. But bacteria do not produce spider silk unless they have been modified genetically, and the protein sequence came from a paper which described a natural species of bacteria and not genetically modified bacteria.</p>
<p>The entry for the protein at UniProt was copied from this entry at GenBank: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023.><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EGY00023</a>.</a> The entry at GenBank includes some metadata that was missing from UniProt, including a note for the CDS that says <span class="quote">"identified by sequence similarity; putative"</span>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entry shown for <em>Nitrospirillum viridazoti</em> Y2 listing <span class="quote">"Major ampullate spidroin 1 MaSp1"</span> is likely a case of misannotation due to automated sequence similarity searches. Here is why this happens:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Annotation by Homology</strong>: The GenBank entry notes that this sequence was <span class="quote">"identified by sequence similarity; putative."</span> This means that during the annotation pipeline, the protein sequence showed local similarity to known spidroin sequences, possibly because of repetitive glycine- and alanine-rich regions or structural motifs that resemble spidroin proteins. Such repetitive domains are common in unrelated proteins across various species.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Spurious Similarity to ATPase Domains</strong>: The region annotation (COG3903) refers to a predicted ATPase domain, which is a general function category not specific to silk proteins. ATPase domains are found in many proteins across life forms. The resemblance to spidroins might arise from structural repeats or motifs that coincidentally align with spider silk sequences, especially in large, repetitive bacterial proteins.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Conceptual Translation Artifact</strong>: The comment mentions <span class="quote">"Method: conceptual translation,"</span> indicating this is a predicted open reading frame (ORF) from genome sequencing data, not experimentally validated. Large bacterial genomes often contain long ORFs with repetitive low-complexity regions that can artifactually match spidroin sequences in databases.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Misleading Product Naming</strong>: The product is named <span class="quote">"Major ampullate spidroin 1 MaSp1,"</span> but this is a bioinformatic label assigned due to sequence similarity, not functional evidence. No experimental data supports that <em>Nitrospirillum viridazoti</em> produces spider silk proteins.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Source Confusion</strong>: <em>Nitrospirillum viridazoti</em> is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium associated with plants, not arachnids. There is no biological reason for it to produce silk proteins. The naming likely results from a bioinformatics pipeline matching a segment of bacterial protein to a spidroin database entry.</p>

<p>This lady on Twitter said that the spidroin clots can be activated remotely (which is similar to the theory by Mike Adams that the calamari clots contain electric circuits that can be triggered by 5G to kill people): [<a href=https://x.com/LouiseBrookes8/status/1904546516292821189>https://x.com/LouiseBrookes8/status/1904546516292821189</a>]</p>
<p><img src=i/clot-spidrointweet-1.png width=550></p>
<p>Someone on Twitter said that the reason why the clots are stained by Thioflavin T might be because spidroin has amyloid-like properties: [<a href=https://x.com/mvwinds/status/1863467028960706983>https://x.com/mvwinds/status/1863467028960706983</a>]</p>

<p>Ulrike Kämmerer said that the reverse ORF actually codes for spider silk, but she didn't mention anything about how the ORF only had an extremely distant match to a spidroin sequence at UniProt, or how the sequence was misannotated. And she said the spidroin is extremely durable, and that once the human body has been instructed to form spidroin, the spidroin can no longer be degraded because it is a foreign protein, which will lead to the buildup of spider silk inside the body. She said it was similar to the accumulation of prions in mad cow disease, and she said the spider silk will destroy cells as it accumulates in human tissue. And she said that Arne Burkhardt had found symptoms of a new type of amyloidosis in people who died from a COVID vaccine, which she speculated might have been due to the spidroin protein.

<p>I told him that maybe AmyloGram was designed to be used with sequences shorter than 1252 aa, because the sequences that were included as sample input were between 11 and 23 aa long:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-amylogram-3.png width=480>
</div>
<p>The paper about AmyloGram said that the maximum length was 14 aa in the set of sequences that was used to train AmyloGram: <span class="quote">"To compare the performance of AmyloGram and other predictors of amyloids, we used the external data set pep424. [...] The sequences in this set were all longer than 5 and shorter than 15 residues."</span> [<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13210-9>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13210-9</a>] In the paper AmyloGram was tested on a set of sequences with a length between 6 and 25 aa: <span class="quote">"Sequences shorter than six and longer than 25 amino acid residues (8 and 27 sequences, respectively) were removed from the set because the former were too short to be processed in the devised n-gram analysis framework and the latter were too diversified and rare, hampering a proper analysis."</span></p>
<p>I tried generating 10 random 20 aa sequences:</p>

<p>Ana Maria Mihalcea has a unique theory on how the calamari clots are formed, because she told Mary Holland from CHD that the clots are formed when nanobots eat red blood cells: <span class="quote">"I analyzed these clots microscopically and found these nanotechnological filaments in there. And Clifford Carnicom and I - we also did chemical analysis on them. I also filmed how the clots actually assemble. What you see is unvaccinated blood, the nano robotic swarm. You see all these green and orange and yellow lights. And they are hijacking the electricity from the red blood cells, and they're killing them basically to feed themselves. It's called energy harvesting, it's well described in the nanotechnological literature. And so these robots then, what they leave in their wake is this. This is the same blood 30 minutes later. The blood is completely destroyed. The robots have moved on. And this is the rubbery clot that we've been seeing. And that you can see how it self-assembles, and literally builds when you are leaving the - when you're drawing the blood, and you are leaving it out for at least four hours."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5gadat-what-is-in-our-blood.html?start=2510>https://rumble.com/v5gadat-what-is-in-our-blood.html?start=2510</a>] The image below shows her <span class="quote">"nanorobotic swarm"</span> of green and orange and yellow lights (and it's also depressing to note that her interview with CHD has 101 upvotes and 1 downvote on Rumble):</p>

<p>During the interview with Mary Holland from CHD, Mihalcea also said:</p>
<ul>
<li>That she and David Nixon found microchips that emitted MAC addresses in vaccines. [25:25]</li>
<li>That metals are used for battlefield interrogation in the military space, because the more metals an individual has, the more easily they can be surveilled through facial recognition. [29:41]</li>
<li>That her colleague Pedro Chavez from Mexico found that there's MAC addresses emitted from grave sites. [37:19]</li>
<li>That calamari clots contain the same polymers that are being sprayed in chemtrails. [45:15]</li>
<li>That EDTA prevents the formation of calamari clots because EDTA kills nanobots by chelating metals out of them. [45:25]</li>
<li>That there's microelectronics from chemtrails in the blood of wild deer. [50:16]</li>
</ul>
<p>But somehow Mary Holland didn't have anything critical to say to Mihalcea, and she never asked Mihalcea questions like <span class="quote">"How do you know that?"</span> or <span class="quote">"What's your source?"</span> or <span class="quote">"How can you see nanotechnology with a light microscope?"</span> or <span class="quote">"Isn't that just Brownian motion and not quantum dots?"</span></p>

<p>CDB or cross-domain bacteria is Clifford Carnicom's name for the supposed causative agent of Morgellons disease.

Or would he have wanted Mike Adams to say that his clots contain electric circuits and nanowire interface structures? I haven't found him denouncing the claims by Mike Adams or Ana Maria Mihalcea anywhere.

<p>An account that promotes Miles Guo posted this video where Ana Maria Mihalcea said that she had found spider silk in calamari clots. The video included this slide about the reverse ORF from a presentation by David Speicher, which featured a photo of calamari clots as if the clots were somehow related to the reverse ORF: [<a href=https://x.com/aus_mini/status/1813411573085692059>https://x.com/aus_mini/status/1813411573085692059</a>]</p>

<p>In an interview David Speicher did in September 2024, he said: <span class="quote">"If you encode going reverse, you get another intact open reading frame that's perfectly intact. You get this whole fibroin heavy chain, which is major ampullate spidroin 1, MaSp1. And that is the same fibroin that's found in silkworm silk. And what are we pulling out of the dead vaxxed people? All of these white fibrinous clots. And these silk proteins are used in spider silk. The thing about spider silk is that if it's in the spider at the right pH and the temperature, it's a liquid form. If it's outside and it cools and the pH changes is when things start to solidify and make silk. So I think - and a lot of groups worldwide are looking at this - but there could be a major link between these clots and what's actually in the intact plasmid DNA."</span> [<a href=https://www.drtrozzi.news/p/genetic-invasion-an-update-with-dr>https://www.drtrozzi.news/p/genetic-invasion-an-update-with-dr</a>, time 27:28]</p>
<p>Speicher showed the slide below where the percentage identities of the matches were covered up, so people couldn't see that the matches had only about 25% identity. His amino acid alignment still showed that most positions of the alignment did not match, but many members of his audience probably did not understand what the alignment meant. And Speicher didn't say anything about how the match to the spidroin protein had an extremely low identity and how it was likely due to chance:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-speicher-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>When Speicher said that <span class="quote">"you get this whole fibroin heavy chain, which is major ampullate spidroin 1, MaSp1"</span>, he mixed up the spider silk protein that was the first match with the silkworm silk protein that was the third match. But they were two different proteins, and the fibroin was not a spidroin or vice versa. However both proteins had the host species listed as a species of bacteria which doesn't produce either spider silk or silkworm silk, so both sequences were likely mislabeled, and they have both now been deleted from UniProt.</p>
<p>Speicher also showed this slide which suggested that the calamari clots might be connected to the reverse ORF:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-speicher-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Speicher has a PhD degree in virology, and he has a postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics, so I have a hard time believing he would be stupid enough to think that the reverse ORF would actually code for spider silk. It seems more likely that he is deliberately promoting disinformation. But he is also one of the main people who have pushed Kevin McKernan's narrative about DNA contamination, which I think increases the likelihood that it's a disinformation narrative (even though the DNA contamination itself seems to be real, but its implications seem to be vastly exaggerated by McKernan and Speicher). But it's interesting that McKernan is now also one of the people who is supposed to have analyzed the calamari clots in a lab.</p>
<p>In October 2023 a preprint about DNA contamination was published by David Speicher, Jessica Rose, Maria Gutschi, David Wiseman, and Kevin McKernan. [<a href=https://osf.io/mjc97_v1/>https://osf.io/mjc97_v1/</a>] In 2023 Maria Gutschi did a presentation where she said: <span class="quote">"So Kevin and group tried to determine what does this protein make - what does mRNA make. The closet thing they found was silk protein, spider protein. Spider silk. Wow. And so, we don't know if that's happening or not - there's a lot that needs to be done - and whether that is the case. But it is a large concern on my side. Because it is not an accident that this mRNA is there on the opposite side. In my opinion it's not."</span> [<a href=https://crowdbunker.com/v/23fVajqu>https://crowdbunker.com/v/23fVajqu</a>, time 26:25]</p>
<p>Jessica Rose has written many Substack posts where she has presented Kevin McKernan's findings in a popularized format. She also wrote a Substack post about the reverse ORF, where she spent most of the post writing about spider silk as if it would somehow be relevant to the reverse ORF, and as if people needed to learn about spider silk to understand the reverse ORF. [<a href=https://jessicar.substack.com/p/what-a-tangled-web-we-may-have-weaved>https://jessicar.substack.com/p/what-a-tangled-web-we-may-have-weaved</a>] She also wrote about a paper titled <span class="quote">"Spidroin N-terminal domain forms amyloid-like fibril based hydrogels and provides a protein immobilization platform"</span>, and she concluded the post by writing: <span class="quote">"Could it be that amyloidogenic peptides akin to spidroin are being translated in people and subsequently creating immobilizing hydrogel scaffolds for other proteins?"</span> (But Bryan Ardis also said that the calamari clots are made up of two snake venom peptides in hydrogel, and Ana Maria Mihalcea has said that the clots are made of both hydrogel and spider silk. This McKernan-Rose-Speicher-Kämmerer network is starting to look like a backup net that catches people who are too refined to be captured by the Peters-Ruby-Ardis-Mihalcea net.)</p>
<p>In her Substack post, Jessica Rose briefly mentioned that the reverse ORF had a weak homology of only about 25% to the spidroin protein, but she didn't write about how the match was likely due to chance, and how the spidroin had nothing to do with the reverse ORF, and there were many other random proteins that had a similarly close match. And she didn't even post instructions on how people can repeat the BLAST search themselves or how people should interpret the BLAST search. I called her out for how misleading the post was, because she must have known it would be misinterpreted by her readers. [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1848961827415249112>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1848961827415249112</a>] Jessica Rose has a PhD degree in the computational biology of viruses, so she should've known the reverse ORF had nothing to do with spider silk, so her post seemed like she was deliberately trying to mislead people.</p>
<p>In March 2025 Richard Fleming published a PDF by the Czech biologist Soňa Peková, who is supposed to have verified McKernan's finding of DNA contamination, and who is basically the Jessica Rose type figure of the Czech Republic. It might be a coincidence, but Soňa Peková is a member of a neo-Theosophical cult called ALLATRA that has many similarities to Ana Maria Mihalcea's cult: <a href=https://jessicar.substack.com/p/the-new-slovakian-report-showing/comment/100916301.><a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/the-new-slovakian-report-showing/comment/100916301" class="uri">https://jessicar.substack.com/p/the-new-slovakian-report-showing/comment/100916301</a>.</a> ALLATRA teaches that reality is oppressed by Draco Reptilians, that Slavs are the oldest ethnic group after the fall of Atlantis, and that there is a 12,000-year pole shift cycle. In one of her interviews Soňa Peková talked about Pleiadians and 5D ascension, and she said that Gaia has the capability to reach not only 5D but 9D reality, even though vaccinated people may not be able to reach a higher dimension. Even though the cult is overtly based in Ukraine, they run a multilingual media operation that produces content in various languages, and their most popular content are English-language deep fake videos that employ the avatar of an American veteran spook called Egon Cholatkian. And in the same way that Scientology is partnered with the Nation of Islam, ALLATRA is also partnered with an African American freemasonic lodge called the World's Masonic United Nations.</p>

<p>The surgeon wrote that they had not seen calamari clots in their lab: <span class="quote">"Anyway, I was looking for examples of what I heard your guy talking about. We also did a lot of vein patients but, once again, though I was watching out for these cases, I never saw/heard about any of our patients (and we had a very active Vein Practice, at least prior to Covid) having extensive venous blockages like your witness produced. DVT's are not that uncommon in a very busy vein ablation practice. We were doing upwards of 30-45 venous ablations a week, on average, prior to Covid. Covid really did a number on us, like other clinics, especially when people started locking down. But the DVT's that we experienced post mRNA Vaccine deployment, and once again, the vast majority of our patients were mRNA vaccinated, their clots were easily managed and fully resolved with a course of anticoagulative treatment, usually within 2-3 weeks. There had to be one in there, but maybe we just didn't identify it."</span></p>
<p>The surgeon also wrote: <span class="quote">"Without understanding the timing of onset of theses white, fibrous clots, when they began forming, either weeks/months prior to their event or just days before their event, I don't know how we could have missed these blockages during the procedures. Moreover, all of our patients, within a week or two prior to a venous ablation or arterial intervention, had a full vascular ultrasound study that would certainly have demonstrated these obvious tissue amalgamations, even the smaller ones. Most certainly the larger ones I've witnessed on your podcasts with your whistleblowers and your embalmers. No way, with our technologist talents, could these growths have been missed."</span></p>
<p>The surgeon speculated that the reason they weren't seeing the clots may have been if the clots formed soon before death: <span class="quote">"The only real conclusions I can come to, during the entire time of witnessing our practice's patient demographics and the procedures we performed on them, and many of them were repeat customers, sometimes requiring multiple repeat annual interventions, is that these blood clots, fibrous or jelly, must happen rather abruptly, because our patients typically receive follow up vascular Ultrasonography 2-3 times per year, and we never noticed these large blockages that would certainly, without a doubt be able to visualized. Our equipment was the best. Our very best techs would have found them too. My surgeon partner looked at every single study personally. Nothing out of the ordinary, anyway. So this makes me hypothesize that these structures must form very quickly in an acute way, resulting in the patient needing an emergency trip to the hospital, or dying and going to the embalmers."</span> However for example Tom Haviland has said that the reason why morticians say they only started seeing the clots in mid-2021 might be if the clots take about half a year to form. And Nicky Rupright King said she didn't start seeing the clots until 2022, and she suggested the clots might take more than a year to reach their full size. And anyway if the clots only take days to form, then why weren't embalmers already seeing the clots in January 2021?</p>
<p>The surgeon who sent the letter to McMillan wrote: <span class="quote">"Unlike the clinic of the Whistleblower in your podcast, that was a hospital that did every body part, from the brain to the heart to the lower extremities, we were limited to doing pelvic and lower extremity endovascular atherectomies and angioplasties. Of course we did some stenting, when necessary."</span> But I don't think that would explain why people in his lab were not seeing any calamari clots. A more likely explanation is that the clots are a hoax, and McMillan's cath lab whistleblower was lying.</p>
<p>I didn't find the surgeon's letter published anywhere else. I also haven't heard McMillan mention the letter anywhere, and I didn't find it published on his blog, which might be because the letter conflicts with the narrative about the clots he is trying to present to his audience.</p>

</h2>
<p>In May 2023 Stew Peters released a sequel to the Watch the Water film, where Bryan Ardis said that COVID was caused by snake venom in tap water. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v2nh8xc-premiere-watch-the-water-2-closing-chapter.html>https://rumble.com/v2nh8xc-premiere-watch-the-water-2-closing-chapter.html</a>]</p>
<p>At time 14:48 Ardis said: <span class="quote">"The actual textilinin protein from the eastern brown snake prevents your body's plasmin from breaking down the blood clots. And it's published by them. We have created a self-assembling nanoparticle hydrogel that causes rapid blood clotting, rapid blood clotting. And it is resistant to plasmin being able to break it down, warfarin from being able to break it down - which is cuminin, a blood thinner - and it's also heparin resistant. And what did you find in every ICU with COVID-19 patients? They were heparin resistant. Why? They had ecarin in their body and textilinin."</span> Then Stew Peters asked: <span class="quote">"Is that what's causing these white fibrous things that embalmers are finding?"</span> And Ardis replied: <span class="quote">"1000% that's what's causing them."</span> So Ardis said he was 1000% sure that the calamari clots were caused by two snake venom proteins.</p>
<p>At time 37:46 Stew Peters pointed out how Ardis was holding a vial with calamari clots when he spoke on the ReAwaken America Tour. And Ardis said they were clots he got from Richard Hirschman, and he again said that the clots are produced by a hydrogel that contains snake venom proteins. And he also talked about an Italian paper by Carlo Brogna et al. where the authors found snake venom peptides in the blood and urine of COVID patients.</p>
<p>At time 40:41, Ardis said: <span class="quote">"Just January 28th of 2023, just a few weeks ago, Dr. Chetty MD out of South Africa - is working this entire time - I have been on Zoom calls with this guy for three years now, as we're learning about COVID, how to treat COVID, the success they're seeing in South Africa. Dr. Chetty is a great, honest, ethical human being. He has done phenomenal work. He stated in an interview on January 28th, 2023 - that in long-hauler COVID patients who are coming to his clinic from around the world - they couldn't get them better with traditional therapies they found worked with other COVID patients. So they ran fecal tests on them to find out is there anything in their body we're unaware of that would keep these people sick with long-hauler COVID symptoms?"</span> Then the video cut to a clip where Shankara Chetty said: <span class="quote">"At that point that we realized we need to look at stool samples. We need to - if it was found in sewage, and I couldn't understand why a virus found in sewage was not tracked backwards to the gastrointestinal tract where it arose, and to figure out what it was doing there. And so we managed to contact Carlo Brogna, who's done some very interesting work on coronavirus. Uh, what he very basically discovered with looking at stool samples was that the virus was replicating, somehow, in these stool samples, and the stools had toxins - protein-based toxins in them. He found with the incubation of the supernatant of this sample on fresh uninfected stool that the viral title rose exponentially and so the toxins as well. And so he proved bacterial phage activity, that this virus has the ability to infect the bacteria of your gut. And he found toxicities there, toxin-like peptides, which were akin to many different kinds of snake venoms, sea-snail poisons, shellfish poisons. And it's a wonder how those got there."</span> Then Ardis said that one way venoms are manufactured synthetically is using bacteria like <em>E. coli</em>, and another way is using mammalian cells, so the mRNA vaccines also contain instructions that cause both bacteria and human cells to produce snake venom.</p>
<p>Shankara Chetty also wrote on Twitter that SARS-CoV-2 not only acts as a bacteriophage, but that it also modifies the DNA of bacteria through insertional mutagenesis to make bacteria produce snake venom. He also said that Tau Braun told him to keep an eye on snake venom in 2021: [<a href=https://x.com/ShankaraChetty/status/1900893736399217058>https://x.com/ShankaraChetty/status/1900893736399217058</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tau first mentioned snake venom to me in 2021 to keep my eye on. He understood that it was being experimented on to be weaponised and could be aerosolized etc. and spread, but I couldn't figure the transmission to other individuals by those affected. He planted the seed and asked that I don't disregard an envenomation as my treatment would address both Envenomation and Hypersensitivity. With the chronic gut issues we were seeing and a positive rectal PCR swab reported early on from China, we contacted Carlo Brogna, who was examining stool. What he found was that the virus had bacteriophage activity and infected the bacteria in your gut, replicating in them and getting them, through insertional mutagenesis, to produce toxins. These toxin like peptides resemble many different kinds of snake venom, conotoxins (sea snail venom), and starfish toxin.</p>
<p>That was the revelation that solved all my questions. Transmission of the toxin occurred through transmission of its code by the virus to the gut bacteria that then made the toxin. This allowed the toxic proteins to evade the hosts' digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine by being made directly in the colon where it can be absorbed unaltered.</p>
<p>UNNATURAL, INTENTIONAL, WELL PLANNED, TRANSMISSIBLE ENVENOMATION.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to insert DNA into a bacterial genome through insertional mutagenesis, I think SARS-CoV-2 would need to have reverse transcriptase. ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a <strong>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To cause insertional mutagenesis (i.e., inserting sequences into host <strong>DNA</strong> genomes), its RNA would need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be reverse-transcribed into DNA</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Be integrated into the DNA genome</strong> of the host (e.g., a bacterium or a human cell).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This process requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse transcriptase</strong>: To convert RNA → DNA.</li>
<li><strong>Integrase (or similar enzyme)</strong>: To insert the resulting DNA into the host genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <strong>SARS-CoV-2 lacks both enzymes</strong>, it <strong>cannot perform insertional mutagenesis</strong> on its own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chetty also wrote that Tau Braun was one of his guardian angels, and Chetty said that he and Tau Braun were snake oil salesman (presumably since they are both trying to sell the story about snake venom):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-tauchetty.png width=591>
</div>
<p>Tau Braun's bio says that he is a <span class="quote">"U.S. National Counterterrorism &amp; EMS Advisor and Trainer"</span>, and he has been a speaker at a bunch of emergency management conferences. [<a href=https://www.drtaubraun.com/about>https://www.drtaubraun.com/about</a>] In 2022 he told Jane Ruby that calamari clots are made of tissue that was programmed to grow snake venom glands by nanobots that used graphene oxide as a delivery mechanism. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221115233622/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/>http://web.archive.org/web/20221115233622/https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/</a>]</p>
<p>In Watch the Water 2 Bryan Ardis said that he had been on Zoom calls with Chetty for three years now. But there's not too many people in the COVID conspiracy movement who are as ridiculous as Tau Braun and Bryan Ardis.</p>
<p>Shankara Chetty is Philip McMillan's sidekick who is frequently featured in videos on the Vejon Health channel. I started to think that McMillan was likely controlled opposition after he published several videos and posts where he promoted Greg Harrison's ORF hoax, but now that I know how his sidekick also promoted the story about snake venom, I have even more reason to suspect that McMillan is not sincere.</p>

</h2>
<p>In 2023 Ana Maria Mihalcea said that Hirschman had sent her a sample of blood mixed with embalming fluid from a body he had embalmed, and she went on Maria Zeee's show to show microscope images of the sample. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230614195806/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-interview-with-maria-zeee-bidens>https://web.archive.org/web/20230614195806/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-interview-with-maria-zeee-bidens</a>, <a href=https://rumble.com/v2u31yo-dr.-ana-mihalcea-bidens-universal-nanotechnology-vaccine-and-zombie-blood.html>https://rumble.com/v2u31yo-dr.-ana-mihalcea-bidens-universal-nanotechnology-vaccine-and-zombie-blood.html</a>]</p>
<p>She didn't say if Hirschman received consent from the family members of the dead person for their blood to be paraded around by scammers (even though it's fairly likely that Hirschman didn't even send her a real sample of blood from an embalmed person).</p>
<p>She said that the calamari clots were made of hydrogel, but she also said that fiber-like structures she saw in the blood under a microscope were made of hydrogel. It reminded me of how Kevin McCairn says that the calamari clots are made of amyloidogenic peptides, but he also says that mystery fibers in his microscope images of blood samples are made of amyloidogenic peptides.</p>
<p>At time 31:07 Mihalcea showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"Just showing you these hydrogel classic ribbons that we've seen in the meat and the rainwater - we've seen them vaccinated and unvaccinated blood - and it's the same stuff that Clifford Carnicom and I looked at that also has functional groups that are consistent with hydrogel. And this is a close up. This is very similar to what Mike Adams saw in the microscopic analysis of the large clots, with this central, you know, hollow lining."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mihalceablood-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 40:56 Mihalcea said: <span class="quote">"Look at this. All of a sudden, how is it possible that that the control of these blinking lights is creating the fluid to come out? This is exactly the process that David Nixon filmed to create a microchip, okay."</span> And then Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"Yes. And I mean, I watched that. People that have watched that have seen it. There's like that - there is a clear interaction between all of the materials forming, even to the point of what appears to be little robotic arms setting parameters, so that this part of the what appears to be a chip doesn't form. And it pulls, it looks like it's pulling out the rest to make the perfect shape."</span> A year earlier Maria Zee had broken the news about how David Nixon found self-assembling robot arms in COVID vaccines. [<a href=https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/>https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/</a>]</p>
<p>At time 41:46 Mihalcea showed the image below, and she said it showed a hydrogel ribbon that was assembled out of blinking lights: <span class="quote">"Are you able to see this filament here? Yes. Okay. So this 20 minutes later, that drop looked like this. It had built this hydrogel ribbon. And you can see that all of the surrounding blinking lights were actually used to create this thing. That wasn't there before. And this is the kind of hydrogel ribbons that we see in the blood 20 minutes to assemble this ginormous ribbon."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mihalceablood-2.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 50:59 Mihalcea said her sample also contained self-creating spheres: <span class="quote">"So the entire blood area was filled with these kinds of spheres that were self-creating, and that had these small light particles in there that looked like they were emitting photonic light."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:07:45 Mihalcea said that calamari clots grow in the presence of a pulsed electromagnetic field, so an MRI scan might make the hydrogel clots grow bigger: <span class="quote">"Well, uh, how about this? Um, so we've shown the pulsed electromagnetic fields, and just exposing the live blood of a vaccinated person - shows that the clot of this, the - the rubbery part of the clot, the hydrogel clot makes it grow. So how many people are getting an MRI scan, even the freedom doctors who are recommending an MRI for the heart to look for myocarditis? Is that making the hydrogel inside of them grow? So if you don't know that certain fields are affecting this technology and could have an adverse effect, and you don't even know it's in people, then you don't know how to take precautions. And so, uh, clinicians need to start learning about this. Because, again, you know, what if you make somebody's clot grow?"</span> And next she said she had found microchips growing in dental anesthetics.</p>

<p>A FactCheck.org article about the Died Suddenly movie said the following: [<a href=https://www.factcheck.org/2022/12/scicheck-died-suddenly-pushes-bogus-depopulation-theory/>https://www.factcheck.org/2022/12/scicheck-died-suddenly-pushes-bogus-depopulation-theory/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last year or so, Hirschman brought in people he worked with as a contract embalmer in Alabama. He knew three of the morticians who appeared in the video, he said.</p>
<p>One of them is Chad Whisnant, whose name is spelled incorrectly in the video.</p>
<p>Whisnant runs a <a href=https://perma.cc/55KT-CBZK>funeral home</a> in Alabama with his wife, Brooke.</p>
<p>He didn't return our call for comment, but Brooke Whisnant told us in a phone interview that the clots shown in the video aren't out of the ordinary and that she doesn't share her husband's view of vaccination, which has changed over the last several years.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"I'm now an antivaxxer,"</span> Chad Whisnant said in the video. <span class="quote">"I wasn't before."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"It's been a slow, slow process ever since Trump took office,"</span> Brooke Whisnant said of her husband's shifting beliefs after former President Donald Trump took office in 2017. <span class="quote">"It's been a very weird abyss of misinformation on the internet,"</span> she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comments by Chad Whisnant's wife seem to indicate that Whisnant is himself a sincere conspiratard, which makes it seem less likely that he was some kind of a plant in the conspiracy movement who had been tasked with producing disinformation. But nevertheless it's interesting that even though his wife ran the funeral home with him, she said that the clots that were shown in the Died Suddenly movie were not out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Chad Whisnant was featured prominently in the Died Suddenly movie, but I haven't found any other place where he has appeared in alternative media. Whisnant's name was misspelled in the Died Suddenly movie, but when I searched Twitter for the properly spelled form of his name in double quotes, I found only two tweets which referred to him.

<a href=#Hirschmans_debut_interview_with_Jane_Ruby_in_January_2022 id=Hirschmans_debut_interview_with_Jane_Ruby_in_January_2022>Hirschman's debut interview with Jane Ruby in January 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>During Hirschman's debut interview he did with Jane Ruby, he said: <span class="quote">"It all started - I can't put my finger on it - but probably around the mid, middle of last year."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vtcsgw-worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find-veins-and-arteries-filled-with-never-bef.html?start=>https://rumble.com/vtcsgw-worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find-veins-and-arteries-filled-with-never-bef.html?start=</a>] In other early interviews Hirshcman similarly said he started seeing the clots around mid-2021, but later he changed his story to say he might have already seen the clots earlier.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby asked: <span class="quote">"Mostly you're seeing them and pulling them from veins, not arteries. Is that correct?"</span> [8:44] Then Hirschman answered: <span class="quote">"Yes. But on this one here I also got one out of the artery as well. Which is unusual. I have here lately been pulling some out of arteries. I pulled one out of an artery last night."</span> So he made it seem like the clots were more common in veins than arteries. However later on Hirschman started to say that the calamari clots were appoximately equally common in veins and arteries. For example in January 2023 when Chris Martenson asked Hirschman if the clots were coming out of veins and arteries <span class="quote">"even-steven"</span> (which means evenly matched), Hirschman answered <span class="quote">"Yes, exactly."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500>https://rumble.com/v25vb6u-embalmers.html?start=1500</a>] During an Hirschman did with Daniel Horowitz in February 2021, which I believe was Hirschman's third interview, he gave the impression that he saw the clots in veins at first and arteries later: <span class="quote">"These clots are unusually firm. They're unusually long. Sometimes they're short. Sometimes they're long. They're just - sometimes it looks like they - that you can literally see how they're branching into different areas of the vein. But then I also started noticing them starting to appear in arteries, which is very unusual."</span> [<a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/are-the-vaccines-causing-solid-frankenstein-blood/id1065050908?i=1000551322493</a>, time 29:19]</p>
<p>But anyway, next Jane Ruby asked: <span class="quote">"Was there any difference in what you observe from the one you pull from arteries compared to the ones you pull from veins?"</span> [9:39] But Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"The ones I pull from veins are much larger usually."</span> That's another detail he may have omitted in his later interviews, even though I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Then Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"They usually have that long strange whitish substance to it, usually a little bit of blood that's attached to it. Sometimes it seems like they're intermingled. It almost seems like the white grows almost out of the blood, as weird as that sounds. Some people are calling me - I call them worms, because to me they represent - they look very similar to the worms."</span> Then Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Right, but we don't want to mislead people to think it's an animal, like a worm. You're just saying that it -."</span> Then Hirschman said: <span class="quote">"It resembles one sometimes, often with me, it resembles a worm. I've never seen one move on its own or anything like that. But it seems, it has the appearance of small worms. I've had someone that was in the embalmenting with me one night, and I was - there was a bunch of them coming out in the blood. And his words were, <span class="quote">'It looks like heartworms for people.'</span> Not saying they were moving. I'm just saying these little stringy structures coming out of the blood."</span> Then Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"Now, are these structures that you're saying resemble like worm-like things - were they separate from the clot that started with the blood, and then the long piece coming out of them?"</span> Then Hirschman said <span class="quote">"usually they're together"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Usually I find a normal clot attached at one end at work, or I find them intermingled in with a clot. That's why I can rinse them out, and you can see the white structure."</span></p>
<p>A similar story that the clots resembled worms or parasites and they had regular blood clots attached to them was also told by Laura Jeffrey, the anonymous embalmer whose photos were shown by Jane Ruby, and the pseudonymous funeral director called Carolyn who was interviewed by Epoch Times.</p>
<p>A draft version of the Epoch Times article said: [<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbn3w73ZW04VJrg4DA7ZUzJWx2YPVJEZ75nkmk2pjRk</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While normal blood clots are dark brown in colour, Carolyn said the fibrous masses are white. But she said they also have a pinkish tone, as they are <span class="quote">"literally feeding off of blood clots."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"They remind me of parasites, because they're creating a blood clot and they're feeding off it,"</span> she said. <span class="quote">"So every tentacle is basically down a part of the circulatory system, and at the end of those fingers there is a normal clot, and it looks like they're feeding off it."</span></p>
<p>Hirschman also said that the fibrous clots appeared to be feeding off normal blood clots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Canadian embalmer Laura Jeffrey said: <span class="quote">"I'm sort of like this and I see something that I thought was a tapeworm. Which was weird, because tapeworms shouldn't be in a circulatory system. And then I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, <span class="quote">'Is this a parasite?'</span> Because a tapeworm's a parasite; that looked like a parasite. [...] Then there's a blood clot that is integrated into the end of those tentacles. It felt like it was a parasite that was feeding off a blood clot that it created in the body. When you think of a parasite, you think - because it feeds off of something, right? Then you see the jelly clots at the end of this parasite. You see those and you think, <span class="quote">'Are they feeding off us as humans? Out of our circulatory system?'</span> Because they always had the currant jelly integrated at the ends."</span> [<a href=https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf>https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS2303TOR204-laura-jeffery.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>At time 15:02 Jane Ruby asked Hirschman: <span class="quote">"But before 2020, like from 2019 and earlier, you've never seen this specific type of combination clot. Is that what you're saying?"</span> So she said the calamari clots were <span class="quote">"combination clots"</span>, as if a distinctive feature of the clots was that they were attached to regular blood clots.</p>
<p>At time 2:36 Jane Ruby showed the image below, and she said it looked like a regular red blood clot on the right but it gradually turned <span class="quote">"more and more white and fibrous"</span> on the right side, and Hirschman also said it looked like a normal clot on the left side:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-debut-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Two days after Jane Ruby interviewed Hirschman, she talked about the interview on the Stew Peters Show. She showed the image above and she said: <span class="quote">"You can see on the far left of this picture, there is a red blood clot, which he said, <span class="quote">'When I touch it, manipulate it, like any blood clot, it does kind of disintegrate and melt, you know, melt away.'</span> But as he moves down, and these are his words, not mine, he said <span class="quote">'This white fibrous piece that becomes the longer portion of it is very tough, it's stretchy,'</span> he can't break it very easily, he said <span class="quote">'It looks like it's emanating out of the clot'</span>, and his words, <span class="quote">'It appears that it's kind of feeding on the blood and the clot.'</span>"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vti2i0-embalmers-discover-horror-dr.-ruby-exclusive-arteries-filled-with-rubbery-c.html?start=112>https://rumble.com/vti2i0-embalmers-discover-horror-dr.-ruby-exclusive-arteries-filled-with-rubbery-c.html?start=112</a>] Ruby also said Hirschman told her that <span class="quote">"I've never seen this type of clot with a connection to the red portion and then this rubbery thing, before 2021"</span>. [4:12] So she seemed to emphasize how the white parts were connected to the red parts. She also showed this photo where there's red parts of a clot attached to white parts:</p>

Do you think this is real?'</span> I said, <span class="quote">'Well, trust but verify is kind of how I work, you know, I observe. And then I do the science.'</span> And so for me, it was like, okay, that looks interesting. It looks legitimate. But I'll believe it when I see it. And now I've seen it."</span></p>
<p>Then Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"The vaccines have been out for a year. How come you're only seeing this now? Or have people been seeing it before, and they're just not reporting it before - been too scared to report it?"</span> [6:16] And Cole answered: <span class="quote">"I think it's that fear factor. I think, I think you hit the nail on the head, because as I talked to some of these morticians, you know, this - I have two hypotheses on these. Number one, they were seeing it and they were like, huh, this is weird. And didn't think anything of it. Or it could be after one shot, you don't see a whole lot of it after two, you see more and after three, you see a lot. So it's really, it's the boosters that really started, uh, the punch here."</span> But a problem with his explanation is that the morticians said the clots were already common before boosters.</p>
<p>At time 16:21 Cole showed the vial of a clot below, and he said the clot was about 12 inches long and he pulled it out of a big vein. And he said similar type of clots may have earlier occurred rarely due to genetic clotting disorders:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cole-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>It was not clear why Cole even had the opportunity to remove a calamari clot from the body. But he may have been the first person who claimed to have seen a calamari clot but who was not a mortician.</p>
<p>However if Ryan Cole had an opportunity to see the clots through his work as a pathologist, and he was also talking to other pathologist, then why did he say that he first heard about the clots a couple of months ago on the internet?</p>
<hr />
<p>One of many reasons why I think Ryan Cole is controlled opposition is that he was one of the very first people who started promoting the turbo cancer hoax. [<a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>] The term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was first introduced in September 2021 in Arne Burkhardt's pathology conference by a person who conveyed an anecdote about turbo cancer from Ute Krüger. Most of the earliest videos that match the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> at BitChute are videos by the German pathologist Ute Krüger. But in a video that was published only 4 days after Burkhardt's pathology conference, Ryan Cole talked about how vaccines cause cancer, and he said: <span class="quote">"I'll have a call later with three German pathologists. They're seeing similar signals. They're gonna be working on it as well. But it's based -. Another colleague in Dallas is gonna be working on it. We're trying to get a consortium of doctors together to study this."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vrnol2-dr.-ryan-cole-is-there-a-covid-vaccine-cancer-connection.html?start=917>https://rumble.com/vrnol2-dr.-ryan-cole-is-there-a-covid-vaccine-cancer-connection.html?start=917</a>] The three German pathologists probably referred to Arne Burkhardt, Walter Lang, and Ute Krüger. In 2023 Arne Burkhardt was asked if there were other pathologists who had been able to confirm his findings, but the only pathologist he named was Ryan Cole. [<a href=https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/>https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/</a>, 1:51:54] When Ryan Cole said he had a colleague in Dallas, he probably referred to the oncologist Ray Page, who was a speaker in a conference in Texas that was livestreamed by Epoch Times, where the speakers also included Ryan Cole, Peter McCullough, and Bryan Ardis. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzEuYRKdJY&t=1h26m39s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzEuYRKdJY&amp;t=1h26m39s</a>]</p>
<p>Ryan Cole's connection to AFLDS is also suspicious. In July 2021 Cole became a <span class="quote">"Medical Director"</span> of the Jew Simone Gold's organization America's Frontline Doctors. The news team of America's Frontline Doctors is run out of Israel by the Kahanist Chabadnik Mordechai Sones. [<a href=https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads>https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads</a>] Sones also hosted the podcast of AFLDS which is now inactive, but during the last episode of the podcast he read out a letter by the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson. [<a href=https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah>https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah</a>] Before COVID Mordechai Sones worked for Israeli mainstream media, and his LinkedIn profile says that in the 1980s he worked on <span class="quote">"research in areas of how to upgade CIA covert arms pipeline to Afghans"</span>. [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-sones-bab8b916/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-sones-bab8b916/</a>]</p>
<p>When Ryan Cole's medical license was revoked, one of the charges brought against him was that he had prescribed ivermectin without obtaining proper informed consent on a telehealth website called MyFreeDoctor.com, which was affiliated with AFLDS. [<a href=https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf>https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf</a>] AFLDS was also affiliated with another similar telehealth website called SpeakWithAnMD.com, which offered prescriptions for ivermectin and the Zelenko protocol. It was launched in April 2020 by Jerome Corsi, who managed two mutual funds for B'nai B'rith, and in 2004 he told The Forward that <span class="quote">"I've been a strong supporter of B'nai B'rith and Jewish causes for 30 years"</span>. [<a href=https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/>https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/</a>] A report about Corsi's website said that over a period of less than two months, the website earned about 7 million USD in consultation fees through customers referred by AFLDS.

<a href=#Genetic_sequencing_of_calamari_clots_by_Kevin_McKernan id=Genetic_sequencing_of_calamari_clots_by_Kevin_McKernan>Genetic sequencing of calamari clots by Kevin McKernan</a>
</h2>
<p>In May 2025 Kevin McCairn wrote this about McKernan's preliminary analysis of the calamari clots: <span class="quote">"Late-cycle amplification signals for SV40 promoter, spike protein coding sequence, and Ori (origin of replication) suggest low-abundance presence of residual plasmid DNA consistent with LNP-based recombinant vaccine components."</span> [<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/cadaver-calamari-amyloidogenic-fibrin</a>] And he wrote: <span class="quote">"These results indicate preliminary molecular evidence for incorporation or association of spike vaccine-related material within the clot matrices."</span></p>
<p>But two weeks later when McKernan published his sequencing results, he ended up debunking his own preliminary findings, because he didn't find a single read that aligned against either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine spikes: <a href=https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin.><a href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin" class="uri">https://anandamide.substack.com/p/whole-genome-sequencing-of-fibrin</a>.</a></p>
<p>The reads that aligned against the Pfizer plasmid sequence aligned against components of the plasmid that matched human or bacterial reads:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pfizerigv.png width=700>
</div>
<p>When I did a BLAST search for the 300-base region after the spike ORF that had a large number of aligned reads in McKernan's alignment, it contained a perfect 141/141 base match to human mtDNA, which is included in the untranslated region after the spike as a stabilizing element. Similarly the region before the spike matched various human and mammalian cloning vectors, and ChatGPT said the region may have mimicked stable human transcripts like β-globin.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have a hypothesis that some of the calamari clots might actually be fake clots that were created using a Chandler loop device, which is a device that circulates blood through a tube until a clot forms on the walls of the tube. If that is the case, some of the clots might actually contain blood from multiple people mixed together rather than blood from only a single donor. So I wanted to test if McKernan's reads contained DNA from multiple different people or only a single person.</p>
<p>But when I did variant calling for mtDNA haplotypes, I got a total of 50 variants with MAPQ score of 100 or above, which were all simple SNVs. And 47 of them are shared by the H10e1 haplogroup, which is found in Northwestern Europe and elsewhere in Europe: <a href=https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/.><a href="https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/" class="uri">https://www.yfull.com/mtree/H10e1/</a>.</a> So it looks like there are not variants from multiple different haplogroups mixed together, or at least not variants that are frequent enough to get a high MAPQ score:</p>

<p>For some reason McKernan's own VCF file for the white clot has only 17 mtDNA variants. And out of them only 12 are simple SNVs, and only 4 of the 12 SNVs are shared by H10e1:</p>

<p>I looked at the forward reads of the white clot sample. McKernan published reads for a white clot and a red clot sample, but I don't know if both of them are supposed to be novel types of clots that were not seen before 2021, or if one of them was a regular non-calamari clot that was used as a control:</p>

<p>McCairn's post has the air of cheap propaganda due to the emphasis on harm done to babies. A trope among alt media morticians is that they have a dramatic story to tell about dead babies, like how Wesley the funeral director said that there were about 10 times more babies dying than normally, so the fridges were packed full of dead babies. [<a href=https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/>https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/</a>] And Nicky Rupright King said that after the vaccine rollout, she saw new types of deformities in dead babies she had never seen before, and that <span class="quote">"the deformities that these children had were astronomical"</span>. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/</a>, 24:45] And the anonymous embalmer whose testimony was published by Laura Kasner wrote that they saw <span class="quote">"an exponential increase in the number of fetal and infant deaths in 2021"</span>, and she saw babies that died of SIDS a few days after their breastfeeding mother received a COVID vaccine, and that <span class="quote">"100% of the fetal and infant deaths that occurred in 2021 were born to vaccinated mothers"</span>. [<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony</a>]</p>
<p>The emphasis of McCairn's post was on scary microscope images, which is reminiscent of content by the Quinta Columna and Stew Peters crowd. ChatGPT said this about McCairn's post: <span class="quote">"This document strongly resembles pseudoscientific or hoax material, exploiting scientific-sounding language and visual data without meeting the necessary standards of scientific proof."</span></p>
<p>McCairn showed these images of a mystery fiber he found in the 3-year-old's blood:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnsub-2.webp width=570>
</div>
<p>He also showed images of a second similar fiber, and he described the fibers he showed as <span class="quote">"autofluorescent fibrillar structures"</span> and <span class="quote">"UV-reactive fibrillar microclots"</span> and <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin microclots"</span>.</p>
<p>Individual strands of fibrin have a string-like shape, because because their purpose is to form a criss-crossing mesh that traps red blood cells and that covers a punctured blood vessel. Some large blood clots have a string-like shape because they conform to the shape of a blood vessel. But that doesn't mean mini clots that are randomly floating around in the blood would also have a string-like shape, unless for example they formed inside a small blood vessel and then got dislodged.</p>
<p>Strands of fibrin typically have a diameter of about 0.1 µm, which is about 50 times smaller than the <span class="quote">"fibrillar structures"</span> shown in McCairn's images.</p>
<p>When Ana Maria Mihalcea sees a fiber-like object under a microscope, she declares it to be a Morgellons filament or a carbon nanotube. If McCairn sees the same object, he says it's a baby calamari clot, an amyloid fibril, or an amyloidogenic peptide. He previously claimed that this structure with a diameter of about 10-20 µm was an amyloid fibril, even though in reality amyloid fibrils have a diameter of about 5-20 nm:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-microniclefibril.jpg width=722>
</div>
<p>McCairn also described this structure as a <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> (which I believe he claims to have found in the blood of a vaccinated person): [<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/</a>; <a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/</a>, time 2:22:25]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnsub-4.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>The structure in the image above is shown to be about 15 µm wide. But the word <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> usually refers to structures with a diameter in the nanometer scale, like amyloid beta fibrils which are typically 7-13 nm in diameter, or collagen fibrils which are typically 50-500 nm in diameter. The object in McCairn's image also has two features that are not consistent with a clot that has an elongated shape because it formed inside a blood vessel and got dislodged from the vessel, because the object is flat and wide, and it has a fold that runs along the middle lengthwise.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn supposedy does his blood analysis using slides of blood mailed by his followers that contain only a small amount of blood, even though it's not clear if that's how he received the blood of the 3-year-old. I pointed out that if he keeps finding baby calamari clots in random samples of blood with a small volume, there should be vast fleets of baby calamari clots swimming around in the bloodstream of people. But he refused to even answer me what volume of blood he analyzed: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1927142276217581798>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1927142276217581798</a>]</p>

<p>The Twitter user Markus pointed out McCairn said one of his microscope images was taken at a 4-fold magnification, but the scale bar seemed to indicate it was taken at a much higher magnification level: [<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1927071726300451325>https://x.com/mar15164/status/1927071726300451325</a>]</p>

<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus.webp width=597>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said that typically <span class="quote">"the field of view (FOV) for a 4x objective on a standard microscope with a 10x eyepiece is around 4–5 mm (4000–5000 µm)"</span>, but McCairn's image showed a width of only about 550 µm, which is only about 12% of the typical FOV:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus-2.webp width=593>
</div>
<p>But McCairn said he didn't even use an eyepiece, so the FOV at 4x magnification should be about 40-50 mm, which means that the visible width of his image is only about 1.2% of a typical FOV.</p>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT if an eyepiece can go up to 100x, it said 100x eyepieces are extremely rare and not practical for most applications, and typically eyepieces only go up to about 15x or 20x magnification. When I asked what could explain McCairn's narrow FOV if the image was taken without an eyepiece, ChatGPT wasn't able to give any reasonable explanation. But it did say it was possible that the scale bar was wrong or the magnification level was reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>McCairn replied to me: <span class="quote">"The field of view is not 0.5mm you cretin, the scale bar shows the pixels derived from the camera using a calibration slide placed on the slide holder. you are looking at an amyloidogenic fibril that is 100's of micrometers in length and the scale bar in red shows 50 micrometers not 0.5mm you moron"</span>.

The field of view means the width visible in the image."</span> And McKernan said: <span class="quote">"Again you're wrong about calibrating the scope. And thread sliding trying to get away from the amyloidogenic clot data."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"How am I wrong? Is the field of view not about 0.55 mm? If you didn't even use an eyepiece, then how do you explain that your FOV is only about a hundredth of a typical FOV at 4x magnification without an eyepiece?"</span> Then McKernan said: <span class="quote">"No it isn't go back to your calculations and think how a stained amyloid structure which by the scale bar is close to 1mm in length fits in that FOV."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"The scale bar is 94 pixels wide, the image is 1047 pixels wide, and 94/1047 is about 0.090. The area of the fiber is about 765 by 260 pixels, and (765^2+260^2)^.5/94*50 is about 430 µm (but the fiber is not perfectly straight, so you can round the length up to 500 µm)."</span> But after that he just replied <span class="quote">"Science is moving on henjin"</span> and linked to his new Substack post. But I told him: <span class="quote">"You still haven't explained why the FOV is only about 550 µm if the image is taken at 4-fold magnification."</span> But he said: <span class="quote">"lmfao how is the fov 0.5mm, tell you henjin, get a scope, get a calibration reticle and see what you come up with. And the amyloid data is pouring in, suck on my big, fat, juicy <span class="quote">'fibril'</span>. Feel its scale invariance pounding your tiny sperg hole!"</span> And I asked: <span class="quote">"Well what is the FOV then, and how are you supposed to calculate it? Is my calculation of 1047/94*50 wrong?"</span> Then another user replied: <span class="quote">"have you ever heard of something called cropping?"</span> And McCairn answered: <span class="quote">"These things would be beyond henjin, in his dos, html world."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"So your explanation for why the FOV is about 1% of a typical FOV at 4x magnification is that the image was cropped? Did the original image display a 100 times wider area but you cropped about 1% of the width of the image?"</span> He didn't answer, but when I later asked the same question again, McKernan said: <span class="quote">"Irrelevant sperg detail, when you have the image across 2 different methods and concordance. Simple fact is you have a large amyloid fibril detected, in the blood, that would fill clinical criteria for a clot. From nano to macro, the presentation is parsimonious."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929183581537968191>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929183581537968191</a>]</p>
<p>He referred to an SEM image of the same fiber-like object he had now posted on Substack. [<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000>https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000</a>] His SEM image was taken at 40-fold magnification, but the object in the image now took up about 50% of the FOV: [<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000>https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sem-3yearold.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>So why did the same object take up about 75% of the FOV in the other image that was supposedly taken at 4-fold magnification?</p>
<p>The object in the new SEM image is about 731 pixels wide, and the 1 mm scale bar is about 460 pixels wide, so the width of the area covered by the object is about 1.59 mm. But in the earlier optical microscope image, the width of the area covered by the object was only about 0.38 mm based on the scale bar.</p>
<p>Jikkyleaks asked: <span class="quote">"Kevin are your scales correct on the SEM pic? In the first picture it looks like that fibril is about 500micrometres long, but the SEM scale is marked in millimetres."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928634205245690299>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928634205245690299</a>] But McCairn answered: <span class="quote">"Yes they are dead on accurate, you are looking at the difference between trying to calibrate off a glass slide reticle that comes from some Chinese sweat shop vs. the precision delivered by top off the line SEM. The scales are within the margin of error between the techniques deployed."</span></p>
<p>I don't know what the ring with the segmented pattern in the SEM image is, but the segments might be due to dessication. Before he took the SEM images of the supposed microclot from the 3-year old, he is supposed to have done ThT staining for the sample. Earlier when I asked what the pattern that looked like cracked glass was in the image below, McCairn said it came <span class="quote">"from the dried solute after adding ThT"</span>: [<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mysteryfibril.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>But anyway, I still didn't have an answer to the question of the old microscope image had a FOV of only about 0.55 mm even though it was supposed to be taken at 4-fold magnification. So I asked McCairn: <span class="quote">"So was your 4x image cropped or not? If so then what percentage of the width of the original image did the cropped image show? It's probably not nearly enough to explain why the FOV was only about 0.55 mm even though a typical FOV at 4x magnification would be about 40-50 mm."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929207032516637023>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929207032516637023</a>] He posted a reply where he didn't answer my question, so I asked him again: <span class="quote">"Was the image cropped or not? It should be a simple question to answer. Or did you use something like a tube lens or digital zoom?"</span> I referred to this tweet by Markus: [<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1929215136167776643>https://x.com/mar15164/status/1929215136167776643</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there's a tube lens and/or other optical components of the camera setup that provides most of the missing magnification, rather than just cropping/digital manipulation.</p>

</h2>
<p>I have joined Kevin McCairn's Discord server multiple times since 2020, and I was even made into a moderator on the server at one point, but I have usually left the server after a while because it had a very low quality of posts. McCairn banned me from the server in May 2025, because I said that the calamari clots were fake and he was probably controlled opposition.</p>
<p>Since his early videos in 2020, McCairn has said that he almost died after he got COVID from the Korean superspreader event in Daegu. He said he had severe neurological symptoms, which was a reason why he knew that COVID had a neurotropic effect and he decided to focus on researching the neurological aspects of COVID.</p>
<p>However the problem with his story is that the Korean superspreader event occurred in February 2020, but McCairn says that he was in Daegu from late November into December 2019. I haven't seen anyone else call him out for his claim until I brought it up on his Discord:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-earlycovid.webp width=691 height=6062>
</div>
<p>I used to think McCairn probably had some other illness but he mistook it for COVID, but after I found out how there's also many other people in alt media who claim that they were among the first people who got COVID in their country, I started to think it's possible that he just made up the whole story about having COVID.</p>
<p>It also seemed like an unlikely coincidence that McCairn was an early YouTube streamer who was focused on COVID, but he also happened to be at the right place at the right time to get infected with COVID very early on. Often if a fabulist invents an embellished biography for themselves, they insert themselves in various locations over the world at a time when some event of historical importance happens to occur at the location. But the Korean superspreader event was probably the best-known event that occurred in Korea in the year of 2020.</p>
<p>In the unlikely scenario where McCairn is not lying and he was actually infected with COVID in November or December 2019, he might have been the first person with COVID in Japan, because he claims that he was still sick with COVID after he returned home to Japan in December 2019.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above I pointed out how Steve Pieczenik claimed that he was the first case of COVID in the United States, and he claimed that he got COVID after he met with a Chinese student from Wuhan (because I guess he didn't count the student as an earlier case of COVID in the United States). [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dq8v0zZpVCCe/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dq8v0zZpVCCe/</a>, 22:08] But how did Pieczenik even know what city the student came from? At the time Americans were not yet familiar with Wuhan, and it wouldn't have meant much to Americans what Chinese city the student came from. And similarly John Mark Dougan lives in Russia where there's only about 20,000 Chinese people in the entire country, but he claimed that he got COVID after he went to an immigration office where he saw Chinese people wearing masks. So in the same way that Pieczenik happened to conveniently come in contact with a student from the right Chinese city, and Dougan happened to convenently come in contact with Chinese people in a country where there's almost no Chinese people, McCairn also happened to conveniently visit the right city in Korea at the right time so he could catch COVID.</p>
<p>I don't know if McCairn actually even visited Daegu in 2019 like he claims, but in one video he also said: <span class="quote">"I got hit by the biggest superspreader event in Asia, right early on, in November to December."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6sfp5f-episode-174-spike-induced-brain-injury.html?start=3776>https://rumble.com/v6sfp5f-episode-174-spike-induced-brain-injury.html?start=3776</a>]</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey also claims that he was one of the first people in the United States to have COVID: [<a href=https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/home0009/research/earlycovidsurvivors>https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/home0009/research/earlycovidsurvivors</a>]</p>

<p>I listened to the audio or searched the transcript of all the videos. He only said he may have gotten COVID in Daegu in one of the videos, which was a video he did with Addy Adds in March 2020. In the video McCairn said: <span class="quote">"And, uh, where I had my lab, which was in South Korea in a city called Daegu, they'd asked me to sort of come and give a, uh, to help them in a project they were doing. And that time was October, no, sorry, November - I want to say it was November into December, but late November, right. And at that time, um, I came back, and over the Christmas period, I got really, really ill, right. And, um, it's sort of left - like the fever I was delirious, so I can't - and again, so I get memory issues because of the head injury. And so apparently when I was in the fever bit, I was coming downstairs and thinking days had passed. And, uh, it, it wasn't, you know, and it took me a week to sort of get over that. And then I was left just, um, with, it's called dyspnea where you can't really breathe."</span> [<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/w/eafNsjv7kWn2VLTdyMisfA?start=1h26m22s>https://t.wtyl.live/w/eafNsjv7kWn2VLTdyMisfA?start=1h26m22s</a>] Then Addy asked if McCairn had COVID, and McCairn said yes, and he talked about how the Shincheonji cult had a church in Wuhan. And then Addy said: <span class="quote">"There's a group of superspreaders there, then."</span> And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"Yeah, and I literally, I literally caught this, um, this illness and, uh, Shincheonji, it's called. [...] So I think I did get an exposure, because a lot of my symptoms fit, and it even left me with sort of, uh, angina and chest pain. And so a lot of these these symptoms that people were describing, I was like, <span class="quote">'oh'</span>."</span></p>

<a href=#Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Cottrell_Couey_Kulacz_and_Webb id=Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Cottrell_Couey_Kulacz_and_Webb>Kevin McCairn's connection to Cottrell, Couey, Kulacz, and Webb</a>
</h2>
<p>I wrote about the topics covered in this section in more detail here: <a href=yt.html>yt.html</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a section for links to streams and websites that are related to his stream, which used to have links to J.J. Couey, Mark Kulacz, Charles Rixey, and a guy on McCairn's Discord who often goes on his streams, even though at one point McCairn removed the link to Couey's website. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230329103032/https://www.mccairndojo.com/>http://web.archive.org/web/20230329103032/https://www.mccairndojo.com/</a>] McCairn, Couey, and Kulacz were all early YouTubers who were focused on conspiracy content about COVID, and they were all featured in early 2020 in video panels hosted by Addy Adds.</p>
<p>I first found out about Kevin McCairn in March 2020 because he was a guest on Paul Cottrell's YouTube channel. [<a href=https://stream.gigaohm.bio/w/pQuDyDr6ayo7n9xZ464Uk5>https://stream.gigaohm.bio/w/pQuDyDr6ayo7n9xZ464Uk5</a>] It was one of the very first videos McCairn did in alt media.</p>
<p>McCairn was later also featured in the first episode of Paul Cottrell's Coronavirus War Room together with George Webb, and McCairn and Cottrell also participated in a series of video panels hosted by Addy Adds. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/xsNuoRDvyLIN>https://www.bitchute.com/video/xsNuoRDvyLIN</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fxb5SNEnK5vf>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fxb5SNEnK5vf</a>] Addy Adds functioned as a mini-me of George Webb for a while, he coauthored multiple books with George Webb, and he did several videos in person with George Webb. He even called himself a citizen journalist like George Webb, Jason Goodman, and Mark Kulacz. J.J. Couey was first introduced to Mark Kulacz by McCairn, because McCairn asked Couey to join the panels hosted by Addy Adds, which also featured Kulacz who used to be part of George Webb's crew of citizen journalists.</p>
<p>George Webb also did a lot of videos with Paul Cottrell, who was Webb's go-to guy on COVID science and Webb's biology teacher. Webb actually managed to learn an impressive amount of details about the biology of COVID from Cottrell.</p>
<p>George Webb has said that he shared an apartment in New York with a spy lady who worked as a caterer at Epstein's parties and who secretly videotaped the parties. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I&start=1m39s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I&amp;start=1m39s</a>, <a href=https://burners.me/2019/07/28/larpwars-part-2-moving-the-goalposts/>https://burners.me/2019/07/28/larpwars-part-2-moving-the-goalposts/</a>] He has also said that he has homies at French Mossad. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ</a>] In one video he listed his intelligence connections, and he said <span class="quote">"when you start way smarter than your IQ, there's a good chance there's an intelligence person behind you making you smarter"</span>. [<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=16m41s>https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=16m41s</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb has also said that he worked with Dutch intelligence in New York. [<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s>https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s</a>] He wrote a book about Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, which is where J.J. Couey used to work, and George Webb was also the main person in alt media who covered a mass shooting at the Erasmus Medical Center. George Webb used to be the sidekick of Jason Goodman, whose current sidekick John Cullen speaks Dutch (which is another interesting Dutch connection in this circle, even though it might be a coincidence). [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Even crazier when you realize that my first ever live streams of any kind were invites to join Paul Cottrell of Operation George Webb, Addy Ads of Operation George Webb, and McCairn...five weekends in a row. McCairn had a solo stream with Ads-Webb one week before. All in on it."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1827727108979724547>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1827727108979724547</a>] But Couey leaves out how his BFF Mark Kulacz was also part of the same circle surrounding George Webb.</p>
<p>In early 2020 both Kulacz and Webb were speculating that SARS-CoV-2 was created in Fort Detrick by Sina Bavari's team, even though I don't know which one of them came up with the theory first. In 2019 before Kulacz had started his own YouTube channel, he did his alt media debut on a channel that was launched by George Webb together with John O'Loughlin, who is the son of a high-level FBI agent. [<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384>https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384</a>, <a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404>https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404</a>, <a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380</a>] Webb did many videos together with O'Loughlin in person, because they both lived in the DC area, which perhaps not coincidentally is where the headquarters of the FBI, CIA, and NSA are located. O'Loughlin is a retired lawyer who was a member of the DC Bar Association.</p>
<p>Mark Kulacz worked as a <span class="quote">"competitive intelligence director"</span> at the company Datto, which made the news in 2015 after the FBI seized a backup server of Hillary's emails that was managed by Datto. In 2019 Mark Kulacz came out as a whistleblower about Datto's role in the email scandal, even though most of what he said was already public information. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf&#x2d;&#x5f;jI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf-_jI</a>] At first I thought his big revelation was that the email server was personally seized by Peter Strzok from the FBI, but Kulacz seems to have copied the claim about Strzok from an anonymous user on Twitter who presented poor evidence for the claim. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520>http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520</a>] But regardless, Kulacz's past as a whistleblower is interesting, because Hillary's emails were one of the main topics that George Webb focused on before COVID, and Webb had a unique theory that part of the emails were leaked by Eric Braverman who was the CEO of Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>After Kulacz started his YouTube channel in 2019, the first guest on his channel was a lawyer from DC whose father was a high-level FBI agent, and the second guest was Patrick Bergy who worked as a cyberwarfare expert for the military contractor Dynology. [<a href=https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/live/episodes>https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/live/episodes</a>] Steve Outtrim wrote: <span class="quote">"Like so many <span class="quote">'ex'</span> intelligence people, Patrick Bergy got his alt-media start on Jason Goodman's <span class="quote">'Crowdsource the Truth'</span> channel. Soon after he was interviewed by George Webb, and soon after that he filed his <span class="quote">'qui tam'</span> lawsuit"</span>.

<p>Bergy is also one of the few people in alt media who has done an interview with Thomas Schoenberger, and Bergy has even used Schoenberger's music as background music in his livestreams.

<p>In April 2020 George Webb's brother reported that Jason Goodman had declared a cyber war against Cottrell because Cottrell appeared on Michael Decon's radio show together with Schoenberger. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200419220724/https://sdny.news/2020/04/03/conspiracy-theorist-jason-goodman-launches-into-fake-quack-doctor-paul-cottrell-in-epic-social-media-stereo-rant-after-thomas-schoenberger-video-surfaces/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200419220724/https://sdny.news/2020/04/03/conspiracy-theorist-jason-goodman-launches-into-fake-quack-doctor-paul-cottrell-in-epic-social-media-stereo-rant-after-thomas-schoenberger-video-surfaces/</a>] During the show Schoenberger said that he had been following Cottrell's channel since mid-January, and Cottrell was a blessing and he was making a huge difference. [<a href=https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-michael-decon-program-217641/episodes/dr-paul-cottrell-thomas-schoen-54538334>https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-michael-decon-program-217641/episodes/dr-paul-cottrell-thomas-schoen-54538334</a>, time 36:10] Both Schoenberger and Cottrell call themselves polymaths, but the Cicada 3301 member Marcia Stockton also calls herself a polymath. [<a href=https://x.com/AlphaUnseen/>https://x.com/AlphaUnseen/</a>]</p>
<p>Thomas Schoenberger made a video about the origins of Q, where he said that in 2017 before the first Q drop had been released, he created a Q puzzle which was part of a Cicada 3301 puzzle called Sevens.Exposed. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CBZbzgbwI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CBZbzgbwI</a>] An official website of Cicada 3301 has a list of their alumni which consists of three people, who are Bruce Cooper Clarke Jr. who was the director of the Office of Strategic Research at the CIA, Iona Miller who is a researcher of the Count of St. Germaine, and Ian Murdock who created Debian Linux.

<p>Iona Miller's husband Richard Alan Miller has been featured as a guest of the Leak Project and Oppenheimer Ranch Project channels on YouTube, which were the first two channels I found where Paul Cottrell ever appeared as a guest, and in fact Cottrell and Richard Alan Miller appeared as guests on consecutive episodes of Oppenheimer Ranch Project in February 2020. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHy6u5Yrwd5lVj0KJnz-i6ubTAPg6CcV>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHy6u5Yrwd5lVj0KJnz-i6ubTAPg6CcV</a>]</p>
<p>Paul Cottrell has a backup channel on YouTube called Abraham Lincoln. It includes only a single video, which is a video uploaded in 2015 that consists of a still image of the logo of Cicada 3301, and if you download the video and create a spectrogram image of the video, it contains a hidden message signed <span class="quote">"3301"</span>. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g</a>] In the comments of the video there is a hint on how to proceed in solving the puzzle further, but I didn't figure out what the hint meant.</p>
<p>Paul Cottrell also posted a video on his main channel where he took a screencapture of his Abraham Lincoln video. In the comments someone asked <span class="quote">"What is this?"</span>, but Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"forward operations"</span>, and when someone else said it was a puzzle, Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"much more than a puzzle my friend"</span>. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s</a>, <a href=i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg>i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg</a>] When I searched for the term <span class="quote">"forward operations"</span> in double quotes on Google, most results were about something called <span class="quote">"defend forward operations"</span> or <span class="quote">"hunt forward operations"</span>, which are terms that are used in the context of cyber warfare and which refer to defensive cyber operations.</p>
<p>In addition to the Cicada 3301 video, Cottrell also posted a second cryptic video that only consisted of text that says <span class="quote">"STONEHENGE 4-10-4"</span> and no audio. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0</a>] Someone posted this comment to the video: <span class="quote">"Hello. Just to say coincidentally there is a skeleton at Stonehenge that was tagged as no. 4-10-4. He was decapitated and it was rumoured that it may have been king Arthur."</span> It sounds like something from a Cicada 3301 puzzle, because they often involve historical artifacts or themes like the Grail legend.</p>
<p>In February 2020 Paul Cottrell posted a short video where he showed a tweet by Voice of Guo Media, which said that at a critical moment on June 4th, Miles Guo's people would go against the top level of the CCP. Then Cottrell said: <span class="quote">"This is code. This is a CIA code for an operation. And what's happening is you take six for June 4th, 2020, okay. Cause that's the date that he's mentioning. Take the six for June divided by two, you get three. You take the four for the date divided by two, you get two. You take 2020, which is two plus zero plus two plus zero is four. Divide it by two, it's two. When you take those answers from those ratios, it adds to three, it makes three, two, two. That is the sign. That's the code that the CIA operation is happening. There is a takedown of the CCP and this was the launch code."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6eic01-feb-4-2020-paul-cottrell-voice-of-guo-media-coronavirus-cia-steve-bannon-em.html>https://rumble.com/v6eic01-feb-4-2020-paul-cottrell-voice-of-guo-media-coronavirus-cia-steve-bannon-em.html</a>] I don't know how he was able to tell that 322 was code specifically for CIA. But anyway, the video was so ridiculous that there's no way Cottrell believed it himself, so it seemed like deliberate disinformation.</p>
<p>In February 2020 Paul Cottrell became known as <span class="quote">"the American whistleblower"</span> in China after one of his YouTube videos went viral in China. [<a href=https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2>https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&amp;gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2</a>] In the video Cottrell said that a follower of his YouTube channel had contacted him on Facebook and sent him screenshots of text messages he received from someone at the CDC, who said that the CDC was hiding the true number of COVID cases in the United States. [<a href=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/>https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/</a>] The screenshots looked fake because they showed the name of the sender as <span class="quote">"Nancy Messonnier (CDC)"</span>, even though they were screenshots of the Messages application on iOS which only displays the first name of the sender. [<a href=https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/>https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/</a>] The same screenshots had also been published a few days earlier by the radio show host Hal Turner, who said that the text messages were not leaked by the person who received the text messages, but by his 18-year-old son who took the screenshots on his father's phone. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed>http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed</a>] When someone on a Chinese website asked if Paul Cottrell's video was legit, another user linked to Hal Turner's website and indicated that it supported Cottrell's story. [<a href=https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679>https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679</a>]</p>
<p>Hal Turner worked as an FBI informant according to testimony in court by his lawyer and himself. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS>http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS</a>, <a href=https://archive.ph/soTD7#selection-505.0-512%2e0>https://archive.ph/soTD7#selection-505.0-512%2e0</a>] He even ran a Nazi rally for the FBI in New York. [<a href=https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181>https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181</a>] In 2008 Hal Turner was plotting a feigned sequel to the Oklahoma City bombing together with a patsy he was working with. [<a href=https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/>https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/</a>]</p>
<p>In 2010 Hal Turner told the New York Times that he <span class="quote">"answered the call of the federal government to infiltrate the white supremacist movement"</span>, and he said that his racist persona was fake, and he told people to <span class="quote">"be confident that the person you hear on radio is not real life"</span>. [<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html</a>] Paul Cottrell and Kevin McCairn are both livestreamers, which is basically the modern-day equivalent of shock jocks on talk radio like Hal Turner. McCairn makes fun of Stew Peters, but McCairn occupies a similar niche as Stew, because they are both shock jocks who have combined coverage of COVID with antisemitic content. Stew Peters serves a purpose of making antisemites look ridiculous, but McCairn also makes antisemites look like some kind of juvenile memetic warriors, and his knowledge on the Jewish question is very superficial.</p>
<p>A user on McCairn's Discord wrote <span class="quote">"Hal is making some changes thanks to Kevin's comment"</span>, and the user linked to a blog post where Hal Turner announced that he made his show shorter on Wednesdays and he was going to spend less time on taking calls from his listeners. [<a href=i/clot-hal-turner-changes.png>i/clot-hal-turner-changes.png</a>] When I asked why Kevin McCairn commented on Hal Turner's radio show, I didn't get an answer from either McCairn or the user on his Discord. Hal Turner also promotes the story about the calamari clots, and he even says that the clots are <span class="quote">"amyloid clots"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Hal_Turner_Show/status/1886947367527514460>https://x.com/Hal_Turner_Show/status/1886947367527514460</a>]</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn is in his fifties, but he has positioned himself as a memetic warrior on the internet, and he and his followers make memes that include characters like Pepe the Frog and Wojak. Mike Benz used to have a fake white nationalist channel on YouTube called Frame Game Radio, which he said was part of a project by Jews to infiltrate the antisemitic movement. [<a href=https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1710479185028726943>https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1710479185028726943</a>] The Twitter account of his white nationalist persona reminded me of McCairn, because Benz's profile picture was a Wojak wearing a Pepe hoodie, and his bio said that he was a veteran of memetic wars and that he <span class="quote">"melded metals into memetic ammo"</span>. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825221401/https://twitter.com/FrameGames>https://web.archive.org/web/20170825221401/https://twitter.com/FrameGames</a>] But both Benz and McCairn seem too old to be posting 4chan memes.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Kevin McCairn has coauthored two scientific papers about COVID. One of them was a paper he wrote with Richard Fleming, where they described a stunt where they filmed blood under a microscope while they applied drops of a COVID vaccine on the blood. [<a href=https://medwinpublishers.com/article-description.php?artId=9730>https://medwinpublishers.com/article-description.php?artId=9730</a>] And the other paper was a review about COVID origins by several members of DRASTIC, who included Dan Sirotkin and J.J. Couey. [<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0</a>]</p>
<p>I first found out about J.J. Couey because his YouTube channel was linked at the top of a blog post by Dan Sirotkin. [<a href=https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/>https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/</a>] Couey discussed the blog post in his first two YouTube videos about COVID. Dan Sirotkin describes himself as a <span class="quote">"former NSA counterterrorism analyst"</span>, and he went to college on an NSA scholarship, but as of 2024 he still lived in the DC area where the headquarters of various intelligence agencies are located. He is also a Jew like George Webb and Paul Cottrell. [<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097</a>] Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Before DRASTIC existed, there was an original duo...Dan and his dad. And then I found them, and we became three. DRASTIC was after this."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320</a>] So Couey was basically the third member of proto-DRASTIC after Dan and Karl Sirotkin. I believe McCairn has never been an official member of DRASTIC, but for example the intro and outro videos for his streams have been done by FunctionGain, which is likely an alter ego of Billy Bostickson who founded DRASTIC. [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1677539890370859009>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1677539890370859009</a>, <a href=https://x.com/BillyBostickson/status/1653490934372528129>https://x.com/BillyBostickson/status/1653490934372528129</a>, <a href=https://drasticresearch.org/drastic-tv/>https://drasticresearch.org/drastic-tv/</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfG4X-vV5XU>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfG4X-vV5XU</a>]</p>
<p>Christie Laura Grace is another one of the many suspicious people McCairn is connected to. In May 2025 she and McCairn went on the Discernable podcast to talk about calamari clots. [<a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/</a>] Her pet topic is LNPs, so she predictably says that the calamari clots are caused by LNPs (in the same way that Geoffrey Norman Pain says that the clots are caused by endotoxin, and Bryan Ardis says that the clots are caused by snake venom). McCairn wrote <span class="quote">"I have covered the LNP's and their propensity for abnormal clots with Christie Grace on stream multiple times."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1801412652650103294>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1801412652650103294</a>] In 2023 McCairn, Rixey, and Grace were also featured in a video panel hosted by Philip McMillan, who seems like a disinformation agent because of his involvement in Greg Harrison's ORF hoax. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYCjFViwBWw>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYCjFViwBWw</a>] Grace has said that she <span class="quote">"recorded experimentation on people"</span> using equipment she received from Project Veritas, because she was going to be a whistleblower for Project Veritas. [<a href=i/christie-laura-grace-project-veritas.jpg>i/christie-laura-grace-project-veritas.jpg</a>] Her story was never released by Project Veritas, but nevertheless they are transparently a controlled opposition outlet, so it's suspicious how Grace was going to be one of their whistleblowers. McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey released the DEFUSE proposal documents that were supposedly given to him by Major Joseph Murphy, but a few months later the DEFUSE proposal was released again by Project Veritas with additional commentary by Murphy.</p>
<p>One of McCairn's biggest cheerleaders on Twitter is CatsRule2023/RexesRule. She has made a lot of meme-style images that promote McCairn, and she often asks people to donate money to McCairn. Her banner image on Twitter has text that says <span class="quote">"NAVSECGRUDIV"</span> and <span class="quote">"NAVCAMSEASTPAC"</span>. She posted a tweet that said <span class="quote">"My NAVSECGRU team was the best"</span>, and when someone asked <span class="quote">"SEAL?"</span>, she replied: <span class="quote">"Sorry, no. Spook here. Love the Seals, though. How about you?"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166>https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166</a>, <a href=https://archive.is/tZhov>https://archive.is/tZhov</a>, <a href=https://archive.is/2gCXL>https://archive.is/2gCXL</a>] NAVSECGRU was a branch of naval intelligence that that was also part of the NSA's Central Security Service. An announcement from 2005 said: <span class="quote">"What was formerly NAVSECGRU has now become NETWARCOM's Information Operations Directorate."</span> [<a href=https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html>https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html</a>] The announcement also said: <span class="quote">"The IO warfare area is composed of five core integrated capabilities: Electronic Warfare, Computer Network Operations, Psychological Operations, Military Deception and Operational Security."</span> So I asked RexesRule if she worked for the deception capability or psyop capability of NAVSECGRU, but she didn't answer me.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Kevin_McCairns_third_Substack_post id=Kevin_McCairns_third_Substack_post>Kevin McCairn's third Substack post</a>
</h2>
<p>I have pointed out to McCairn that individual fibrils of fibrin have a string-like shape because their purpose is to form a mesh that traps red blood cells. And large blood clots have an elongated shape because they conform to the shape of blood vessels. But that doesn't mean that intermediate-scale formations of fibrin would also have an elongated string-like shape, unless for example they formed inside a small blood vessel and then got dislodged from the vessel.</p>
<p>When McCairn looked at a sample of blood from a 3-year-old under a microscope, he supposedly found this mini calamari clot with a diameter of about 5 µm and length of about 500 µm: [<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrils-in-a-post-gestational>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrils-in-a-post-gestational</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-toddler-microclot.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>Now in his third Substack post McCairn provided the following explanation for why his mini clot had a string-like shape: <span class="quote">"These comparisons between nano- and macro-structures highlight the conserved geometry of pathological amyloidogenesis. This scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar architecture aligns with prior biophysical studies demonstrating that amyloid formation follows universal thermodynamic pathways, forming twisted ribbon-like or lamellar structures irrespective of protein species or environmental origin (<a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>Chiti &amp; Dobson, 2017</a>; <a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045104>Eisenberg &amp; Sawaya, 2017</a>). The similarity across scales - from nanometer-thick fibrils to centimeter-scale clots - suggests a deeply encoded biophysical template likely seeded by persistent amyloidogenic peptides, such as SARS-CoV-2 spike protein."</span></p>
<p>However I'm not convinced by his explanation, and I didn't find any part in the two papers he linked that would've explained why amyloid formations on the micrometer scale would have a string-like shape.</p>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT to describe the shape of common types of amyloid formations in the human body on the micrometer-scale, it gave me the following list:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="aβ-alzheimers">1. Aβ (Alzheimer's)</h3>

</blockquote>
<p>There is only type of amyloid formation on the list above that has a string-like shape on the micrometer scale, which are the microclots associated with long COVID. But I couldn't get ChatGPT to cite any source which said that amyloid clots associated with COVID actually had a string-like shape, so ChatGPT may have been influenced by McCairn's post which I had shown it earlier.</p>
<p>The list above says that IAPP/amylin forms <span class="quote">"sheet-like or intercellular ribbon deposits"</span>, but ribbons of IAPP typically have a diameter of about 10-15 nanometers.</p>
<p>I asked McCairn: <span class="quote">"Is there some specific part of the papers you cited which says that formations amyloid protein have a tendency to form into a ribbon-like shape in the micrometer scale?"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1928612282696671237>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1928612282696671237</a>] But he gave me the following non-answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we go again, you are not looking at the canonical amyloidogenic form, merely based on the size of the aggregations .</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you this? That is why I as the domain level expert uses the language as I see fit.</p>
<p>Especially when it reacts to all the diagnostic measurements used to detect amyloids.</p>
<p>ThT Fluorescence, SEM structural characteristics, RT-QuIC reactivity, Raman Spectra confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied: <span class="quote">"You suggested amyloid structures have a <span class="quote">'scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar architecture'</span> so they have a tendency to form into a ribbon-like shape on the micro-scale, and you cited two papers from 2017. Which part of the papers supports your point?"</span> But I didn't get any answer.</p>
<p>A paper by Pretorius and Kell featured the following images of microclots, with this caption: <span class="quote">"Representative micrographs of ThT-positive events passing through the flow cytometer. All micrographs are obtained at 20x magnification. Each group contains 6 micrographs from different individuals. The image on the left of each micrograph is obtained from the bright field channel (Ch01), and the image on the right is obtained from the fluorescent channel (Ch07). The number in the top left corner of each micrograph represents the event number within a given sample run."</span> [<a href=https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4507472/v1>https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4507472/v1</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>When I asked Douglas Kell if his group had also seen the kind of fiber-like microclots that were shown in McCairn's Substack post, he just replied <span class="quote">"these experiments are quite different so comparisons are not usefully made"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/dbkell/status/1928858289166561296>https://x.com/dbkell/status/1928858289166561296</a>] Then I asked him: <span class="quote">"McCairn supposedly finds these mystery ribbons on slides of blood he receives in the mail from his followers. Have you also tried looking at samples of blood under a microscope to see if they contain similar formations, or if they contain amyloid microclots?"</span> But he told me: <span class="quote">"We have only studied plasma"</span>.</p>
<p>McCairn said: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928898424038109639>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928898424038109639</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the experiments conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="dbkell">@dbkell</span> and colleagues, the whole blood is spun in a centrifuge, larger aggregates would be pulled to the bottom of the tube.</p>
<p>Spinning and looking at the plasma phase would leave the smaller amyloidogenic seeds in the plasma phase. This allows automated sorting through techniques like flow cytometry. This is a better approach for batch processing, you will miss the larger aggregations due to centripetal forces being greater on larger amyloidogenic forms.</p>
<p>Slide analysis is much slower, requires someone with trained eyes, is labor intensive, and requires the follow on tests of ThT staining, SEM/EDX, Raman Spec, for categorization.</p>

<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: I now asked McCairn again to show what part of the two papers from 2017 he cited supported his claim that aggregates of amyloid protein tend to organize into a ribbon-like shape on the micrometer scale. [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929356877130838498>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929356877130838498</a>] But he now quoted the following paragraphs from the Chiti et al. 2017 paper: [<a href=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These β-structured oligomers are able to grow further by self-association or through the addition of monomers, often with further and sometimes dramatic structural reorganizations, to form well-defined fibrils with cross-β structure and a high level of structural order (Figure 1). Alternatively, the disordered aggregates or native-like aggregates can grow without any major structural conversion and give rise to large amorphous deposits or native-like assemblies, respectively, retaining the structure characterizing the initial oligomers (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Such large aggregates, including amyloid, amorphous, or native-like assemblies, have links with human disease as they accumulate in well-defined pathological states. Tables 1 and 2 list the proteins and the disorders that have now been identified to be associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils or other types of aggregates, respectively. (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 also list, for each protein, references reporting the identification of the protein in the aggregates and the characteristics of the aggregate type.) We have arranged both tables in terms of proteins rather than disorders to stress the fact that many of these proteins have been found to be involved in a variety of pathological conditions. Interestingly, immunoglobulins or their subunits are found in all the different types of protein aggregates, including amyloid (as in light-chain amyloidosis), amorphous (as in light-chain deposition disease), and native-like (as in Berger disease) structures, thus representing a remarkable manifestation of the multiplicity of pathways existing in protein aggregation and of the structures and morphologies that can be generated (24–26). Those proteins that form intracellular inclusions of types that are still debated, such as TDP-43 and p53, are included in Table 2 with a footnote explaining this uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I pointed out that Figure 1 illustrated typical nano-scale amyloid fibrils. And Supplemental Table 1 characterized the shape of various types of amyloid structures as <span class="quote">"intrinsically disordered"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-intrinsically.png width=660>
</div>
<p>Then McCairn posted his microscope photos and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're so retarded! This particular amyloid, is novel and not listed because you're looking at science being done in real time.</p>
<p>The principles of misfolding though, are likely the mechanism leading to the macroform and of course the species of protein undergoing change. Fibrin is inherently primed to make macromolecular structures, hence the amyloidogenic form is going to be larger.</p>
<p>Which is why I have gone to the effort of showing concordant structure across scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I told him: <span class="quote">"Post-COVID clots are not relevant to my question. You cited two pre-COVID papers to support a claim that amyloid aggregates have <span class="quote">'scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar architecture'</span> and they form <span class="quote">'twisted ribbon-like or lamellar structures irrespective of protein species'</span>."</span> And McCairn replied: <span class="quote">"That's because there is no post-COVID manuscripts showing the phenomenon, in the manner that I have, you're looking at it being made right now, and disseminated to the public. It is usual in scientific writing to point to key historical citations that demonstrate concordance within hypothetical frameworks."</span> But he still didn't answer my question, so I told him: <span class="quote">"We already know you claim that baby calamari clots have a tendency to form into a ribbon-like shape on the micrometer scale. The question was which part of the sources you cited supports the claim that the same applies to other types of amyloid formations."</span></p>
<p>But then McCairn said <span class="quote">"there is a coherency in the epistemological grounding of the amyloid PRION formation"</span>, so I told him it sounded like great pseudo-profound bullshit: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929507781163524103>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929507781163524103</a>]</p>

</div>
<hr />
<p>A user on Twitter said that the string-like object in McCairn's microscope image was too big to be an aggregate of amyloid protein, and it looked like dust or debris. McCairn cited a paper by Pretorius and Kell which said that <span class="quote">"the fibrinaloid microclots that we observe are typically in the range 1–200 µm on their longest axis"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1930402739089223987>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1930402739089223987</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-kell-microclotsize-1.png width=550>
</div>
<p>However the text he quoted referred to this figure, which showed that the microclots of Pretorius and Kell did not have a string-like shape like McCairn's mystery fibrils:</p>

<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: Kevin McCairn left in Markdown bold formatting in one part of his Substack post. I thought it looked like text copied from some AI utility, because Substack doesn't even support Markdown. [<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164383206>https://substack.com/home/post/p-164383206</a>] If I had a Substack blog, I might write my posts in Markdown in my local text editor and then convert the Markdown to HTML and paste the HTML to Substack, but it doesn't seem like something McCairn would do.</p>
<p>When I brought up the topic to McCairn, he said the Markdown formatting was part of an AI-generated summary of the post and he left <span class="quote">"the markdown in for transparency"</span>. But I don't buy his excuse, because the Markdown formatting was not even a clear sign that the text was generated by AI, and it would've been more transparent to explicitly write that the text was AI-generated.</p>
<p>And many of the details listed in the summary were not even mentioned in the rest of his post: [<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1930594561115517436>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1930594561115517436</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnai.webp width=596>
</div>
<p>From his initial response it wasn't actually clear which of my options was correct. But anyway, after my comments he also edited the post to rewrite the list in my screenshot as paragraphs:</p>
<div>

<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: Children's Health Defense posted a video clip where Suzanne Humphries said that when she looked at the contents of a COVID vaccine vial under a microscope, she saw structures that look like circles and squares, and a while later she saw structures that looked like circuit boards forming in the vaccine: [<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1934672856232726843>https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1934672856232726843</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-humphries-4.png width=550>
</div>
<p>Under replies to the tweet, some random users posted about stories that they apparently thought were related to the discovery by Humphries. They included the chip-like structures found by people in Burkhardt's conference, graphene disks found by Zandre Botha, and the amyloid fibril that Kevin McCairn supposedly found in the blood of a 3-year-old (but a common denominator between Burkhardt, Botha, and McCairn is that they all belong to the small club of people who have presented a laboratory analysis of calamari clots):</p>

<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: McCairn now did a stream where he looked at the contents of a Moderna vaccine vial under a microscope. He saw this fiber-like structure, and he said <span class="quote">"If I saw that in blood, I'd be like, uh that looks suspect"</span>: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6vgvsh-precipitating-botox-brain-sasha-latypovas-nanobots.html?e9s=src_v1_upp_a?start=7209>https://rumble.com/v6vgvsh-precipitating-botox-brain-sasha-latypovas-nanobots.html?e9s=src_v1_upp_a?start=7209</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>McCairn showed the fiber-like formations were also autofluorescent. He said he didn't know what they were, but he said: <span class="quote">"And the problem with there being bacterial contamination - I don't know how much those fibrous mats are like bacterial hydrogels in this instance."</span> [2:05:23] He also showed this fiber-like structure that was stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-2.webp width=1100>
</div>
<p>He also showed this structure that he described as a filament, which was also stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Therefore the fiber that McCairn found in the blood sample of the 3-year-old may have also been a false positive: [<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1938825698237661541>https://x.com/mar15164/status/1938825698237661541</a>]</p>

<p>The Died Suddenly movie was produced by Lauren Witzke, who was the producer of Stew's show and his movies until 2024. In April 2024 Stew Peters posted this tweet: <span class="quote">"The <span class="citation" data-cites="DiedSuddenly_">@DiedSuddenly_</span> account has been hijacked by <span class="citation" data-cites="LaurenWitzkeDE">@LaurenWitzkeDE</span> et al and is currently not being run by the Stew Peters Network."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915</a>] Around the same time he filed a lawsuit against Lauren Witzke's production company, where he also said that the Twitter account and website of Died Suddenly were now run by Witzke's crew. [<a href=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/>https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/</a>, <a href=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire>https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire</a>]</p>
<p>In May 2025 the Died Suddenly crew announced that they were raising funds for a new film called <span class="quote">"DS2: Nano Sapiens"</span>, which was going to be directed by Matthew Skow, who also directed the Died Suddenly film together with Nicholas Stumphauzer. [<a href=https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1927822317607915557>https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1927822317607915557</a>]</p>
<p>Jikkyleaks said that the cast of the film was full of glowies, but Kevin McCairn replied <span class="quote">"LMFAO at the list of cretins in that list, Died Suddenly needs to die in ways only I can think up if they're grifting for funds to buy equipment"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928632048287355207>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928632048287355207</a>]</p>

<p>One of the people featured in the film was Maria Zeee, but a few weeks earlier Kevin McCairn appeared on Maria Zeee's show together with Richard Hirschman, who was the main star of the Died Suddenly film:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-zeeemccairn.png width=333>
</div>
<p>Several other people featured in the Nano Sapiens film are also connected to the story about the calamari clots: [<a href=https://ds2nano.com>https://ds2nano.com</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ana Maria Mihalcea:</strong> When she presented a microscope video of blinking lights as evidence that Hirschman's coffee ground clots contained quantum dot micro robots, Hirschman told her: <span class="quote">"You got some pretty daggum solid proof behind you when you're showing the actual images, you're showing the blinking lights"</span>. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html?start=3657>https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html?start=3657</a>] When she said she saw Morgellons filaments in Hirschman's clots, Hirschman told her: <span class="quote">"I had a live blood analysis of my own blood and my blood had some of those filaments in it too."</span> She also did a video where she showed microscope images of embalmed blood she received from Hirschman, which she said contained Morgellons filaments, self-creating spheres, and blinking lights that constructed ribbons out of hydrogel. But I haven't seen Hirschman denounce Mihalcea's claims anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>La Quinta Columna:</strong> I have found no reference to a new type of white fibrous clots before January 2022 when the story about the clots was broken by Jane Ruby. But Jane Ruby also says that she broke La Quinta Columna's story about graphene oxide. [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338</a>] In 2021 before the story about the new type of white clots had been rolled out, La Quinta Columna were saying that vaccinated women had black period blood with black clots. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/</a>]</li>
<li><strong>Youngmi Lee and Daniel Broudy:</strong> Their paper about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines was published by the journal IJVTPR. IJVTPR has also published the only scientific paper about calamari clots I have found, which was coauthored by Daniel Santiago and John Oller who are both members of the editorial board of the journal. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/73>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/73</a>] Santiago also wrote a Substack post about the clots where he promoted McCairn's research. [<a href=https://santiagod.substack.com/p/substack-article-amyloidogenic-white>https://santiagod.substack.com/p/substack-article-amyloidogenic-white</a>] Daniel Santiago has 6 published works at ORCID but all of them were published in IJVTPR. [<a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5975-0592>https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5975-0592</a>] In 2024 IJVTPR published a paper which said there was nanotechnology in COVID vaccines because the vaccines contained a high level of lanthanides, and later a response to criticism of the paper was published by 6 editors of IJVTPR, who included Santiago, Oller, and Broudy. They wrote that the likelihood that lanthanides <span class="quote">"are not involved in self-assembling entities in the fluids and in the unnatural clots in many recipients is zero"</span>. [<a href=https://mail.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/114>https://mail.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/114</a>] In 2024 Broudy's nanotechnology paper was discussed by Matt Shelton and Philip McMillan, who both presented the paper in a favorable way. Shelton said that he knows Broudy, and that Broudy is <span class="quote">"a goldmine on the way that language is used to propagandize, you know, and force ideas and arguments onto people"</span>. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&start=37m12s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJwkSaIVHE&amp;start=37m12s</a>] Both Matt Shelton and Daniel Santiago were credited in An Unholy Triad. McMillan also presented a document about the fake ORFs that was provided by Santiago. But McMillan has also done multiple videos about Kevin McCairn's research on the clots.</li>
<li><strong>David Nixon:</strong> He is a member of NZDSOS which promoted the Unholy Triad videos, and which published a testimony by an anonymous mortician who claimed to have seen calamari clots.

<li><strong>Steven Quay:</strong> Greg Harrison did a video presentation where he claimed that a paper by Quay explained why the spike protein induced the formation of calamari clots. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v67ytd7-the-hidden-patterns-a-chemists-startling-discovery-about-covid-19-and-its-a.html>https://rumble.com/v67ytd7-the-hidden-patterns-a-chemists-startling-discovery-about-covid-19-and-its-a.html</a>] By looking at the supplementary data in another paper, Quay found three 20 aa segments that overlapped with Pradhan's first three inserts and that had a high fibrinogen binding affinity. But Quay presented the results in a misleading way, and he didn't show that more than half of the NTD was covered by 20 aa segments that had equal or higher fibrinogen binding affinity as the three segments he highlighted.</li>

<p>In June 2025 Nicolas Hulscher published this tweet, where he promoted McCairn's Substack post about the mini calamari clot that McCairn supposedly found in the blood of a 3-year-old: [<a href=https://x.com/NicHulscher/status/1929689987974385879>https://x.com/NicHulscher/status/1929689987974385879</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-1.jpg width=593>
</div>
<p>Two weeks earlier Hulscher interviewed Greg Harrison and Richard Hirschman about the calamari clots. McCairn told me he had informed Hirschman about how Harrison was a scammer, but for some reason Hirschman is still fine with going on podcasts with Harrison: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928128047515062379>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928128047515062379</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-2.jpg width=596>

<p>In May 2025 McCairn and Hirschman also went on the show of Maria Zeee, which is now part of Vigilant News Network that was founded by TWC's founder Foster Coulson:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-zeeemccairn.png width=333>
</div>
<p>Hulscher is the <span class="quote">"foundation administrator"</span> of McCullough Foundation, and he also runs the Twitter account of McCullough Foundation. Peter McCullough is the Chief Scientific Officer of The Wellness Company.</p>
<p>TWC's Chief Marketing Officer used to be Christopher Alexander, whose work experience includes having <span class="quote">"successfully secured over 300 million dollars in contracts for Information Operations, PSYOP, and intelligence support"</span> and being <span class="quote">"recognized as a leader in disinformation, misinformation, and counter-propaganda campaigns"</span>. [<a href=https://beyondthemaze.substack.com/p/the-wellness-company>https://beyondthemaze.substack.com/p/the-wellness-company</a>] TWC's cofounder and the CEO of Zelenko Labs is David Lopez, whose bio says that he is a <span class="quote">"Subject Matter Expert (SME) on Tactical Operations, Classified Global Counter-Terrorism Operations/Terrorist Countermeasures"</span> and that he <span class="quote">"serves as a special projects manager for Blackwater and conducts security operations around the world for select clients"</span>. [<a href=https://missionsixzero.com/our-team/david-lopez/>https://missionsixzero.com/our-team/david-lopez/</a>]</p>
<p>In 2024 I scraped the reposts of about 80 accounts that I suspected to be bots that promoted content about COVID from the controlled alternative media. When I sorted COVID-related accounts by the number of reposts by suspected bots divided by their number of followers, McCullough Foundation ranked second. [<a href=bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers>bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers</a>] The 4th highest ranking user was William Makis, who was on the <span class="quote">"Chief Medical and Scientific Board"</span> of TWC Canada which is now defunct.

<p>Makis presents ivermectin and fenbendazole as miracle cures for turbo cancer. But before COVID both of them were offered as cures for Morgellons disease: [<a href=https://x.com/Humanparasites8/status/1121415232071581696>https://x.com/Humanparasites8/status/1121415232071581696</a>]</p>

<p>In 2024 Hulscher and McCullough coauthored a paper with Raphael Stricker, who is possibly the main person responsible for popularizing the hoax about Morgellons disease. In 2021 Stricker also coauthored a paper with the TWC Chief Medical Board members McCullough and Risch: [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael-Stricker>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael-Stricker</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-strickerpapers.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Stricker was one of two people on the advisory of Morgellons Research Foundation, which was founded by Mary Leitao who coined the term Morgellons disease. Their website featured these photos of Morgellons filaments in the blood of a 3-year-old boy, which are reminiscent of the mysterious filament that McCairn found in the blood of a 3-year-old: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20021121193025/https://www.morgellons.org/>http://web.archive.org/web/20021121193025/https://www.morgellons.org/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-morgellons.jpg width=450>
</div>
<p>In 2019 the California Medical Board issued a complaint against Stricker because he had prescribed ivermectin as a treatment for Morgellons disease without obtaining informed consent.

<p>Ana Maria Mihalcea said that calamari clots are <span class="quote">"made from these filaments that Clifford Cardicom calls cross-domain bacteria or Morgellons filaments"</span>, and she showed these images of Morgellons filaments that she found in Hirschman's clots: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html?start=2269>https://rumble.com/v4buruf-truth-science-and-spirt-episode-6-rubbery-clots-conversation-with-richard-h.html?start=2269</a>]</p>

<p>Then Hirschman told Mihalcea <span class="quote">"I had a live blood analysis of my own blood and my blood had some of those filaments in it too"</span> (even though it's not clear if by filaments he meant Morgellons filaments or some other type of filaments). Mihalcea said that Hirschman's clots contained quantum dot micro robots, and she presented a microscope video of blinking lights as evidence, but Hirschman told her <span class="quote">"you got some pretty daggum solid proof behind you when you're showing the actual images, you're showing the blinking lights"</span>.</p>
<p>The only scientific paper about calamari clots I have found was published in the journal IJVTPR. One of the people on the editorial board of the journal is Shimon Yanowitz. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>] He said that the photo below showed a ribbon that he found in his blood even though he was not vaccinated, but he said it may have come from either chemtrails or from shedding from vaccinated people. He said that the ribbon was possibly a Morgellons filament, and that it looked very mean and it made red blood cells nervous: [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/</a>]</p>

<p>In 2021 Finnegan wrote an article about Morgellons disease, where he claimed that he has witnessed Morgellons disease in his extended family members, he described the Carnicom Institute as a credible source, and he suggested that the presence of microplastics in rain might mean that Morgellons is spread through chemtrails. He wrote that Morgellons disease was the result of a <span class="quote">"adverse events in nanotechnological failure"</span>, and he compared Morgellons filaments to nanowires produced by genetically modified viruses (even though nanowires are not even visible with a light microscope like the supposed Morgellons filaments).

<p>Finnegan was mentored by John Loftus, who also wrote the foreword for his book and who provided Project Paperclip files Finnegan that Finnegan used to write his book. Loftus is a former Army intelligence officer, Nazi hunter, and president of the Florida Holocaust Museum. [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loftus_%28military_author%29>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loftus_%28military_author%29</a>] A bio of Loftus said: <span class="quote">"As a young U.S. Army officer, John Loftus helped train Israelis on a covert operation that turned the tide of battle in the 1973 Yom Kippur War."</span> [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20030604055731/http://john-loftus.com/bio.asp>https://web.archive.org/web/20030604055731/http://john-loftus.com/bio.asp</a>] Loftus claims that he is an Irish Catholic, but he even wrote a column called <span class="quote">"Spyview"</span> for a Haredi Jewish magazine called Ami.</p>
<p>Loftus wrote several books about how the US intelligence apparatus was secretly controlled by the Nazis, including <span class="quote">"The Belarus Secret"</span> and <span class="quote">"The War Against the Jews"</span>. Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"The Office of Special Investigations historian David Marwell described Loftus' book The Belarus Secret as 'the worst kind of amateur history.'[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-0hsC2iFq8C&dq=charles+r+allen+john+loftus&pg=PT251>6</a>] Vital Zayka, a fellow of the Center for Jewish History in New York City, accused Loftus of falsification.[<a href=http://nn.by/?c=ar&i=26162>7</a>] The Israeli historian and Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff described the book as controversial and referred to Charles R.

<p>Loftus used to organize an annual conference called The Intelligence Summit, whose advisory council included two former heads of the CIA and senior officials of the Mossad. [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligence_Summit>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligence_Summit</a>] Another member of the advisory council was Paul E. Vallely, who was Michael Aquino's commanding officer at the 7th PSYOP Group, and who coauthored the article <span class="quote">"From PSYOP to Mindwar"</span> with Aquino. The main financial contributor to the conference was the Israeli gangster Michael Cherney, who has been denied a visa to the United States since 1999 because of his involvement with the Russian Jewish mafia. In 1999 the Intepol issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney for money laundering and organized crime.

<p>Joel van der Reijden wrote this about Finnegan's mentor: <span class="quote">"Other very obvious neocons - hardcore Zionists, in fact - that have appeared on Coast to Coast AM are Robert Spencer and John Loftus. Spencer runs the anti-Islamic outfit Jihad Watch and sits on the advisory board of the Intelligence Summit. [...] Loftus is tied to the highest levels of Israeli and Zionist political and intelligence circles. Former CIA directors James Woolsey and John Deutch sat on the board of his Intelligence Summit until 2006, when very obvious Russian mafia ties to the Summit's long-term financier, Russian Zionist oligarch Michael Cherney, were made public. Woolsey and Deutch should have known about these ties, because since the late 1990s Cherney has been repeatedly and convincingly linked to the powerful Russian-Zionist Solntsevskaya mafia and its allies. These allies also include the primary Rothschild partner in Russia, Oleg Deripaska, as well as the Israeli state, which prevented a KGB/FSB-ran assassination against Cherney in 1995. In 2003 Cherney also founded the Jerusalem Summit, which sponsored at least two small meetings between Israeli officials and American neocons. At the first meeting in 2003 Richard Perle and Coast to Coast's Frank Gaffney were present, along with Ehud Olmert and Benyamin Netanyahu. That's two visitors of Coast to Coast AM with clear ties to Michael Cherney: John Loftus and Frank Gaffney. Basically, inviting either of these two men is the same as giving voice to propaganda of the CIA, MI6, Mossad, Russian-Zionist oligarchs and the Russian-Zionist Solntsevskaya mafia all at once."</span> [<a href=https://isgp-studies.com/coast-to-coast-am-radio-on-ufos-aliens-and-conspiracy>https://isgp-studies.com/coast-to-coast-am-radio-on-ufos-aliens-and-conspiracy</a>]</p>

<p>Nick claims that HIV is a recombinant of Visna and SIV, but he was unable to answer me which parts of the genome of HIV come from Visna, and I have shown him simplots which demonstrate that no part of the genome of HIV is closer to Visna than to SIV.

<p>His knighting is interesting considering how the Soviets launched a series of disinformation campaigns which claimed that HIV was a bioweapon created by the Americans: [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Denver>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Denver</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The groundwork appeared in the pro-Soviet Indian newspaper Patriot, which, according to a KGB defector named Ilya Dzerkvelov, was set up by the KGB in 1962 with the sole purpose of publishing disinformation.[11] An anonymous letter was sent to the editor in July 1983 from a <span class="quote">"well-known American scientist and anthropologist"</span> who claimed that AIDS was manufactured at Fort Detrick by genetic engineers. The <span class="quote">"scientist"</span> claimed that <span class="quote">"that deadly mysterious disease was believed to be the results of the Pentagon's experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons"</span>, and implicated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientists sent to Africa and Latin America to find dangerous viruses alien to Asia and Europe. These results were purportedly analyzed in Atlanta and Fort Detrick and thus the <span class="quote">"most likely course of events"</span> leading to the development of AIDS. The letter claimed that The Pentagon was continuing such experiments in neighboring Pakistan and as a result, the AIDS virus was threatening to spread to India. The title of the article, <span class="quote">"AIDS may invade India"</span>, suggested that the immediate goal of the KGB's disinformation was to exacerbate tensions between the U.S., India, and Pakistan.[11][12]</p>
<p>Two years later, the KGB apparently decided to make use of its earlier disinformation to launch an international campaign to discredit the U.S. They wrote in a telegram to their allied secret service in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Committee for State Security (KDS) on September 7, 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are conducting a series of [active] measures in connection with the appearance in recent years in the USA of a new and dangerous disease, <span class="quote">"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - AIDS"</span>..., and its subsequent, large-scale spread to other countries, including those in Western Europe. The goal of these measures is to create a favorable opinion for us abroad that this disease is the result of secret experiments with a new type of biological weapon by the secret services of the USA and the Pentagon that spun out of control.[8][13]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The story about Fort Detrick is reminiscent of how George Webb and Mark Kulacz claimed that SARS-CoV-2 was created in Fort Detrick by Sina Bavari. Kulacz did his alt media debut on the channel of John O'Loughlin, who is Finnegan's biggest advocate in alt media.

[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealgeorgewebb1+finnegan&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealgeorgewebb1+finnegan&amp;f=live</a>] George Webb and Jason Goodman both speak fluent Russian according to Steve Outtrim, and Jason Goodman was married to a Ukrainian.

[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1906271151120097528</a>] One of the reasons I gave for why his table was fake was that it had an ORF that was 60 aa long and had 50% Q/N residues, even though the maximum number of Q or N residues in any 60 aa segment of Wuhan-Hu-1 is only 16. In order to verify a statement like <span class="quote">"SARS-CoV-2 has an ORF that is 60 amino acids long and has 50% Q/N content"</span> experimentally, you'd have to sequence the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and then analyze the sequence through the methods of bioinformatics. But the experimental part has already been done, because SARS-CoV-2 has already been sequenced. If Greg wanted to show his ORFs are real, he could simply post the nucleotide range of each of his ORFs in Wuhan-Hu-1. But he won't do that, because he won't be able to show that there's any 60 aa ORF with 50% Q/N content.</p>
<p>Greg's AI said it was a <span class="quote">"personal attack"</span> when I said Greg's ORFs were AI hallucinations. I don't know if the AI meant a personal attack against itself or against Greg. But Greg's AI is high on its own supply, because it even said that these images were not AI hallucinations, but the reason why the text in the images was garbled was because the images employed a phonetic scrambling technique used by bioweaponeers: [<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1888539927929037124>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1888539927929037124</a>]</p>

<p>A Twitter user called Tom Czerniawski said that prions from vaccines will kill so many people that all human life on earth will end, and McCairn replied to him suggesting that the prions will cause an evolutionary bottleneck event: [<a href=https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1928824583651545587>https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1928824583651545587</a>]</p>

<p>Earlier Tom Czerniawski was going around asking billionaires to donate money to McCairn, because he said that if McCairn receives a few hundred thousand USD in donations, he <span class="quote">"COULD SAVE EVERYONE FROM DYING HORRIBLY"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915925037430751313>https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915925037430751313</a>, <a href=https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915928819808035265>https://x.com/BlackTomThePyr8/status/1915928819808035265</a>]</p>

<p>In May 2025 Kevin McCairn published a Substack post about how he supposedly found an amyloid fibril in the blood of a 3-year-old. His story went viral after Nicolas Hulscher published a Substack post about the story. Hulscher's post was then copied by Frank Bergman from Slay News, and Bergman's article was promoted by the Died Suddenly account on Twitter (which posted a screenshot of Bergman's article copied to another fake news site called TRUTH11.COM):</p>

<p>A week later a paper about how vaccinated people were magnetic was published in the Indian predatory journal IJIRMS, which has also published papers by Hulscher and McCullough. At first the paper didn't get too much attention, but it went viral a few days later after Nicolas Hulscher wrote a Substack article about the paper, and after that the article was copied by Frank Bergman, and again Bergman's article was promoted by Died Suddenly:</p>

<p>My family of 5 are unlucky patients who took pFIZER Feb 2021 double jab In Rockaway NJ.</p>
<p>Using an Olympus CX 43 lab microscope from January 3, 2024 regular for some reason in November 2024 I observed the fiber looking structures in my blood. I began to research what they were.</p>
<p>Suspicious of the PJab in January to May 2025, I checked my wife and children. Bad news.<br> I observed the same strange structures in each of them.</p>

<p>The first image was actually a video clip, but I included a screenshot of the video above. The guy in the video said that the cells were white blood cells, but I think they're actually red blood cells.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn posted this reply to the street, where he indicated that one or more of the structures in the images were <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1937732108119847100>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1937732108119847100</a>]</p>

<p>The structures in the first two images are about 3-5 times wider than the red blood cells, but red blood cells have a diameter of about 6 µm, so the width of the structures is roughly consistent with McCairn's supposed mini calamari clots, which had a diameter of about 10-20 µm. (The mini clot that McCairn supposedly found in the blood of the 3-year-old appeared to be only about 5 µm wide based on the scale bar in the optical microscope images, but it was about 4 times wider based on the scale bar in the SEM image, and McCairn said the scale bar was more accurate in the SEM image.)</p>
<p>One of McCairn's mini clots was flat like the structures in the first two images, but the others didn't look flat. But even McCairn's flat mini clot had a lengthwise fold in the middle, which was missing from the objects posted by Jesus4AllAlways. And none of McCairn's mini clots looked nearly as translucent as the objects in the first two images, even though I don't know if it may have been due to a difference in lighting or microscopy technique. And McCairn's mini clots didn't have the kind of folds of about 90 degrees as the first two images, where you can see different parts of the folded structure overlapping each other.</p>
<p>So why was McCairn ready to declare that the objects in the images were <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin"</span>?</p>
