McCairn's connection to Cottrell, Couey, Kulacz, and Webb</a>
</h2>
<p>I wrote about the topics covered in this section in more detail here:
<a href=yt.html>yt.<wbr>html</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a list of links to websites that are
related to his stream, which used to consist of links to the websites of
J.J. Couey, Mark Kulacz, Charles Rixey, and a guy called Paul on
McCairn's Discord, even though at one point McCairn removed the link to
Couey's website.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230329103032/https://www.mccairndojo.com/>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20230329103032/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>mccairndojo.<wbr>com/<wbr></a>]
McCairn, Couey, and Kulacz were all part of a circle of early YouTubers
who were focused on conspiracy content about COVID.</p>
<p>I first heard about McCairn in March 2020 because he was a guest on
Paul Cottrell's YouTube channel.
[<a href=https://stream.gigaohm.bio/w/pQuDyDr6ayo7n9xZ464Uk5>https://<wbr>stream.<wbr>gigaohm.<wbr>bio/<wbr>w/<wbr>p<wbr>Q<wbr>u<wbr>D<wbr>y<wbr>D<wbr>r<wbr>6<wbr>a<wbr>y<wbr>o<wbr>7<wbr>n<wbr>9<wbr>x<wbr>Z<wbr>4<wbr>6<wbr>4<wbr>U<wbr>k<wbr>5<wbr></a>]
It was one of the first videos McCairn did in alt media. McCairn and
Cottrell next participated in a series of video panels hosted by Addy
Adds.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/xsNuoRDvyLIN>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>xsNuoRDvyLIN</a>]
At AltCensored, the oldest videos that matched Kevin McCairn's name were
all videos posted by Addy Adds:
[<a href=https://altcensored.com/search/new/page/2?q=kevin%20mccairn>https://<wbr>altcensored.<wbr>com/<wbr>search/<wbr>new/<wbr>page/<wbr>2?<wbr>q=kevin%<wbr>20mccairn</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnaddy.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>McCairn lives in Japan, and his wife is half Japanese and half Paki,
but Paul Cottrell also used to live in Japan and his wife is Japanese.
Addy lived in Japan in 2017-2019 because his mother worked as a Spanish
teacher on a US military base in Okinawa.

<p>Addy Adds functioned as a mini-me of George Webb for a while, he
coauthored multiple books with George Webb, he did many videos in person
with Webb, and he was Webb's wingman on January 6th. In the fashion of
George Webb, Jason Goodman, and Mark Kulacz, Addy also calls himself a
citizen journalist. Addy even said that he was <span
class="quote">"knighted"</span> by George Webb, but I don't know if it
meant that Webb initiated Addy to become a member of some secret order,
like The Most Excellent and Accepted Rite of Citizen Journalists, or if
his knighting had a more mundane meaning.
[<a href=https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1721435465931174322>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>OneAddyAdds/<wbr>status/<wbr>1721435465931174322</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb also did many videos with Paul Cottrell, who was Webb's
go-to guy on COVID science and Webb's biology teacher. Webb actually
managed to learn an impressive amount of details about COVID from
Cottrell. McCairn and Webb were the two guests on the first episode of
Paul Cottrell's <span class="quote">"Coronavirus War Room"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fxb5SNEnK5vf>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>Fxb5SNEnK5vf</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb has said that in 2002 to 2003, he shared an apartment in
New York with a lady who worked as a caterer at Epstein's parties and
who secretly videotaped the parties.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I&start=1m39s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=iFxnxWCBu6I&amp;<wbr>start=1m39s</a>,

Webb has also said that he has homies at French Mossad.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=dKBC3gChmKQ</a>]
In one video he listed his intelligence connections, and he said <span
class="quote">"when you start way smarter than your IQ, there's a good
chance there's an intelligence person behind you making you
smarter"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=16m41s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>pscp.<wbr>tv/<wbr>webb4bernie/<wbr>1ynKOjWpwBVxR?<wbr>t=16m41s</a>]</p>
<p>In a Periscope livestream in 2017, Webb said that he used to work
with Dutch intelligence in New York: <span class="quote">"So, let me - I
was talking about Mossad earlier. So, so, I didn't know that these
people that were presenting themselves - little bit at a time - <span
class="quote">'Oh, I'm just a diplomat. Oh, I'm just actually, uh, well,
actually I had some intelligence background way back when. Oh, actually,
um, I did a few operations. Oh, well, I might still do occasional stuff
for blah blah blah. Oh, yeah, actually I am French intel.'</span> That
kinda procedure. And this happened to me with the Dutch. And now I'm
just - I'm gonna let everybody know right now, I used to work with the
Dutch in New York. So it wasn't Russia. And I did drops."</span>
[<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>pscp.<wbr>tv/<wbr>webb4bernie/<wbr>1ynKOjWpwBVxR?<wbr>t=10m55s</a>]
Webb wrote a book about Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, which is
where Couey used to work, and Webb was the main person in alt media who
covered a mass shooting at the Erasmus Medical Center. Webb used to be
the sidekick of Jason Goodman, whose current sidekick John Cullen speaks
Dutch, or at least he has posted several tweets in Dutch.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=from%<wbr>3AI_<wbr>Am_<wbr>JohnCullen%<wbr>20lang%<wbr>3Anl&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]</p>
<p>Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Even crazier when you realize
that my first ever live streams of any kind were invites to join Paul
Cottrell of Operation George Webb, Addy Ads of Operation George Webb,
and McCairn...five weekends in a row. McCairn had a solo stream with
Ads-Webb one week before. All in on it."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1827727108979724547>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>jjcouey/<wbr>status/<wbr>1827727108979724547</a>]
But Couey leaves out how his BFF Mark Kulacz was also part of the same
circle surrounding George Webb.</p>
<p>In early 2020, both Kulacz and Webb were speculating that SARS-CoV-2
was created in Fort Detrick by Sina Bavari's team. In 2019 before Kulacz
had started his own YouTube channel, he did his alt media debut on a
channel that was launched by George Webb together with John O'Loughlin,
who is the son of a high-level FBI agent.
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>leytedriver/<wbr>status/<wbr>1171849929427472384</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>leytedriver/<wbr>status/<wbr>1100400815032934404</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicLive/<wbr>status/<wbr>1742404612819210380</a>]
When Webb lived in the DC area, he did many videos in person with
O'Loughlin, who is a retired lawyer who was a member of the DC Bar
Association.</p>
<p>Mark Kulacz worked as a <span class="quote">"competitive intelligence
director"</span> at a company called Datto, which made the news in 2015
after the FBI seized a backup server of Hillary's emails that was
managed by Datto. In 2019 Kulacz came out as a whistleblower about
Datto's role in the email scandal, even though most of what he said was
already public information.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf&#x2d;&#x5f;jI>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=xTpvuAf-_<wbr>jI</a>]
At first I thought his big revelation was that the email server was
personally retrieved by Peter Strzok from the FBI, but Kulacz seems to
have copied the claim about Strzok from an anonymous user on Twitter,
who presented poor evidence for the claim.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20180120165625/<wbr>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicITS/<wbr>status/<wbr>954173497168875520</a>]
But regardless, Kulacz's past as a whistleblower is interesting, because
Hillary's emails and DNC emails were one of the main topics that George
Webb was focused on before COVID, and Webb had a unique theory that a
part of the emails was leaked by Eric Braverman who was the CEO of the
Clinton Foundation. Peter Strzok is also a frequent character in George
Webb's stories, and Webb says that Strzok's father had an integral role
in the Iran nuclear deal.
[<a href=https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1581369692639617027>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>OneAddyAdds/<wbr>status/<wbr>1581369692639617027</a>]
Webb was introduced to Jason Goodman by Lee Stranahan, who said he
introduced the supposed DNC hacker Guccifer 2.0 to Roger Stone.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Stranahan>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Lee_<wbr>Stranahan</a>]</p>
<p>After Kulacz started his YouTube channel in 2019, the first guest on
his channel was a lawyer from DC whose father was a high-level FBI
agent, and the second guest was Patrick Bergy, who worked as a
cyberwarfare expert for the military contractor Dynology.
[<a href=https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/live/episodes>https://<wbr>sites.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>housatonicits.<wbr>com/<wbr>live/<wbr>episodes</a>]

soon after that he filed his <span class="quote">'qui tam'</span>

However after Goodman and Webb, the third person in alt media I found
who interviewed Patrick Bergy was Mark Kulacz, who also calls himself a
citizen journalist like Goodman and Webb.</p>
<p>Bergy is one of the few people in alt media who has done an interview
with Thomas Schoenberger, and Bergy has even used Schoenberger's music
as background music in his livestreams.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v29akrm-the-american-awakening-special-edition-thomas-schoenberger-interview-on-mat.html>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v29akrm-<wbr>the-<wbr>american-<wbr>awakening-<wbr>special-<wbr>edition-<wbr>thomas-<wbr>schoenberger-<wbr>interview-<wbr>on-<wbr>mat.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>In April 2020, George Webb's brother reported that Jason Goodman had
declared a cyber war against Cottrell because Cottrell appeared on
Michael Decon's radio show together with Schoenberger.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200419220724/https://sdny.news/2020/04/03/conspiracy-theorist-jason-goodman-launches-into-fake-quack-doctor-paul-cottrell-in-epic-social-media-stereo-rant-after-thomas-schoenberger-video-surfaces/>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200419220724/<wbr>https://<wbr>sdny.<wbr>news/<wbr>2020/<wbr>04/<wbr>03/<wbr>conspiracy-<wbr>theorist-<wbr>jason-<wbr>goodman-<wbr>launches-<wbr>into-<wbr>fake-<wbr>quack-<wbr>doctor-<wbr>paul-<wbr>cottrell-<wbr>in-<wbr>epic-<wbr>social-<wbr>media-<wbr>stereo-<wbr>rant-<wbr>after-<wbr>thomas-<wbr>schoenberger-<wbr>video-<wbr>surfaces/<wbr></a>]
During the show, Schoenberger said that he had been following Cottrell's
channel since mid-January, and Cottrell was a blessing and he was making
a huge difference.
[<a href=https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-michael-decon-program-217641/episodes/dr-paul-cottrell-thomas-schoen-54538334>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>podchaser.<wbr>com/<wbr>podcasts/<wbr>the-<wbr>michael-<wbr>decon-<wbr>program-<wbr>217641/<wbr>episodes/<wbr>dr-<wbr>paul-<wbr>cottrell-<wbr>thomas-<wbr>schoen-<wbr>54538334</a>,
36:10] Both Schoenberger and Cottrell call themselves polymaths, but the
Cicada 3301 member Marcia Stockton also calls herself a polymath.
[<a href=https://x.com/AlphaUnseen/>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>AlphaUnseen/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>Thomas Schoenberger made a video about the origins of Q, where he
said that in 2017 before the first Q drop had been released, he created
a Q puzzle which was part of a Cicada puzzle called Sevens.Exposed.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CBZbzgbwI>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=64CBZbzgbwI</a>]
Bryan Word who has done post-production for Schoenberger's videos wrote

The website of Cicada 3301 has a list of their alumni which consists of
three people, who are Bruce Clarke who was the director of the Office of
Strategic Research at the CIA, Iona Miller who is a researcher of the
Count of St. Germain, and Ian Murdock who created Debian Linux.
[<a href=https://www.cicada3301official.com/pages/alumni.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>cicada3301official.<wbr>com/<wbr>pages/<wbr>alumni.<wbr>html</a>]
Bruce Clarke was Schoenberger's mentor, and Schoenberger has called
himself a reincarnation of the Count of St. Germain.</p>
<p>Iona Miller's husband Richard Alan Miller has been a guest of the
Leak Project and Oppenheimer Ranch Project channels on YouTube, which
were the first two channels I found where Paul Cottrell ever appeared as
a guest, and in fact Cottrell and Richard Alan Miller appeared as guests
on consecutive episodes of Oppenheimer Ranch Project in February 2020.

<p>Paul Cottrell has a backup channel on YouTube called <span
class="quote">"Abraham Lincoln"</span>. It has only a single video,
which consists of a still image of the logo of Cicada 3301, and if you
create a spectrogram image of the audio channel of the video, there's a
hidden message signed <span class="quote">"3301"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=bCmKGFTEO2g</a>]
In the comments of the video, there's a hint on how to proceed in
solving the puzzle further, but I didn't figure out what the hint
meant.</p>
<p>In 2020 on his main channel, Paul Cottrell also posted a video where
he recorded his screen while he played the Abraham Lincoln video. In the
comment section, someone asked <span class="quote">"What is
this?"</span>, but Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"forward
operations"</span>, and when someone else said it was a puzzle, Cottrell
replied <span class="quote">"much more than a puzzle my friend"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=6IRNXFCOV8s</a>,
<a href=i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg>i/<wbr>yt-<wbr>cottrell-<wbr>cicada-<wbr>3301.<wbr>jpg</a>]
When I searched for the term <span class="quote">"forward
operations"</span> on Google, most of the top results were about
something called <span class="quote">"defend forward operations"</span>
or <span class="quote">"hunt forward operations"</span>, which are terms
that are used in the context of cyber warfare and which refer to
defensive cyber operations.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Paul Cottrell posted a video where he showed a
tweet by Voice of Guo Media, which said that at a critical moment on
June 4th, Miles Guo's people would go against the top level of the CCP.
Then Cottrell said: <span class="quote">"This is code. This is a CIA
code for an operation. And what's happening is you take 6 for June 4th,
2020, ok. Cause that's the date that he's mentioning. Take the 6 for
June divided by 2, you get 3. You take the 4 for the date divided by 2,
you get 2. You take 2020, which is 2 plus 0 plus 2 plus 0, is 4. Divide
it by 2, it's 2. When you take those answers from those ratios, it adds
to 3, it makes 3, 2, 2. That is the sign. That's the code that the CIA
operation is happening. There is a takedown of the CCP and this was the
launch code."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6eic01-feb-4-2020-paul-cottrell-voice-of-guo-media-coronavirus-cia-steve-bannon-em.html>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6eic01-<wbr>feb-<wbr>4-<wbr>2020-<wbr>paul-<wbr>cottrell-<wbr>voice-<wbr>of-<wbr>guo-<wbr>media-<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>cia-<wbr>steve-<wbr>bannon-<wbr>em.<wbr>html</a>]
I don't know how he was able to tell that 322 was code specifically for
the CIA. Was it somehow bonesmen at the CIA who were taking down the
CCP? But anyway, the video was so ridiculous that there's no way
Cottrell believed it himself, so the video seemed like deliberate
disinformation.</p>
<p>In February 2020, one of Cottrell's YouTube videos went viral in
China, so he became known as <span class="quote">"the American
whistleblower"</span> in China.
[<a href=https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>baidu.<wbr>com/<wbr>s?<wbr>wd=%<wbr>22paul+<wbr>cottrell%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>gpc=stf%<wbr>3D1580508000%<wbr>2C1583013600%<wbr>7Cstftype%<wbr>3D2</a>]
In the video, Cottrell said that a follower of his YouTube channel had
contacted him on Facebook and sent him screenshots of text messages
which the follower had received from someone at the CDC, who said that
the CDC was hiding the true number of COVID cases in the United States.
[<a href=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bilibili.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>av91204053/<wbr></a>]
The screenshots looked fake because they showed the name of the sender
as <span class="quote">"Nancy Messonnier (CDC)"</span>, even though they
were screenshots of the Messages application on iOS which only displays
the first name of the sender, but the initials of the sender were shown
as <span class="quote">"NM"</span>, so the last name of the contact
would've had to additionally start with an <span
class="quote">"M"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>benplowman/<wbr>status/<wbr>1231447635338264576/<wbr></a>]
The same screenshots had been published a few days earlier by the radio
host Hal Turner, who said that the text messages were not leaked by the
person who received the text messages, but by his 18-year-old son who
took the screenshots on his father's phone.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200217063226/<wbr>https://<wbr>halturnerradioshow.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>en/<wbr>news-<wbr>page/<wbr>news-<wbr>nation/<wbr>alleged-<wbr>c-<wbr>d-<wbr>c-<wbr>text-<wbr>messages-<wbr>say-<wbr>over-<wbr>1-<wbr>000-<wbr>infected-<wbr>with-<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>in-<wbr>u-<wbr>s-<wbr>a-<wbr>being-<wbr>deliberately-<wbr>concealed</a>]
When a user on a Chinese website asked if Paul Cottrell's video was
legit, another user linked to Hal Turner's website and indicated that it
supported Cottrell's story.
[<a href=https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>zhihu.<wbr>com/<wbr>question/<wbr>373999679</a>]
I guess the user on the Chinese website didn't notice that Cottrell and
Turner presented conflicting stories about the origin of the text
messages.</p>
<p>Hal Turner worked as an informant for the FBI, and he even organized
a Nazi rally for the FBI in New York.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20080118203302/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>recordonline.<wbr>com/<wbr>apps/<wbr>pbcs.<wbr>dll/<wbr>article?<wbr>AID=/<wbr>20080117/<wbr>NEWS/<wbr>801170326/-<wbr>1/<wbr>NEWS</a>,

In 2008 Hal Turner was plotting a feigned sequel to the Oklahoma City
bombing, where his patsy was going to blow up Obama with a truck bomb.
[<a href=https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/>https://<wbr>headlineusa.<wbr>com/<wbr>fed-<wbr>files-<wbr>iii-<wbr>fbi-<wbr>informants-<wbr>phony-<wbr>obama-<wbr>truck-<wbr>bomb-<wbr>tip-<wbr>spurred-<wbr>federal-<wbr>probe/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>In 2010 Hal Turner told the New York Times that he <span
class="quote">"answered the call of the federal government to infiltrate
the white supremacist movement"</span>, and he said that his racist
persona was fake, and he told people to <span class="quote">"be
confident that the person you hear on radio is not real life"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>nytimes.<wbr>com/<wbr>2010/<wbr>03/<wbr>04/<wbr>nyregion/<wbr>04hal.<wbr>html</a>]
Paul Cottrell and Kevin McCairn are both livestreamers, which is
basically the modern-day equivalent of shock jocks on talk radio like
Hal Turner. McCairn makes fun of Stew Peters, but McCairn occupies a
similar niche as Stew, because they are both shock jocks who have
combined coverage of COVID with antisemitic content. Stew Peters serves
a purpose of making antisemites look ridiculous, but McCairn also makes
antisemites look like some kind of juvenile memetic warriors, and his
knowledge about the Jewish question is very superficial.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn is in his fifties, but he has positioned himself as a
memetic warrior on the internet, and he and his followers make memes
that include characters like Pepe the Frog and Wojak. Mike Benz is a Jew
who is around the same age as McCairn. Benz used to have a YouTube
channel called Frame Game Radio, which he said was part of a project by
Jews to infiltrate the white nationalist movement.
[<a href=https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1710479185028726943>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>MikeBenzCyber/<wbr>status/<wbr>1710479185028726943</a>]
The Twitter account of his fake white nationalist persona reminded me of
McCairn, because Benz's profile picture was a Wojak wearing a Pepe
hoodie, and his bio said that he was a veteran of memetic wars and that
he <span class="quote">"melded metals into memetic ammo"</span>.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825221401/https://twitter.com/FrameGames>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20170825221401/<wbr>https://<wbr>twitter.<wbr>com/<wbr>FrameGames</a>]
But both Benz and McCairn seem too old to be posting 4chan memes.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Kevin McCairn has been featured as a coauthor of two
scientific papers about COVID. One of them was a review of COVID origins
by several members of DRASTIC, who included Dan Sirotkin and J.J. Couey.
[<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0>https://<wbr>link.<wbr>springer.<wbr>com/<wbr>article/<wbr>10.<wbr>1007/<wbr>s10311-<wbr>021-<wbr>01211-<wbr>0</a>]
The other was a paper McCairn wrote with Richard Fleming, where they
described a stunt where McCairn filmed blood under a microscope while he
applied drops of a COVID vaccine on the blood.
[<a href=https://medwinpublishers.com/article-description.php?artId=9730>https://<wbr>medwinpublishers.<wbr>com/<wbr>article-<wbr>description.<wbr>php?<wbr>artId=9730</a>]
Fleming claims that he started studying for his PhD degree in particle
physics at age 12, because he was part of a secret program that was a
successor to MK-Ultra, but the image he presents as his PhD diploma is
fake. [<a href=fleming.html>fleming.<wbr>html</a>] In 2020 Fleming faked an
entire clinical trial of COVID treatments, which supposedly had 1,800
patients across 7 countries, but Cheshire has shown that Fleming never
actually conducted the trial. McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey wrote the
foreword for Fleming's book, and Rixey and McCairn were speakers on
Fleming's Crimes Against Humanity tour. As far as I know, Rixey and
Fleming were the only western people who provided testimony to Peter
Kotlár's Slovakian COVID commission. The videos by the commission were
published on the Facebook page of a lady who used to work as a
newscaster on mainstream TV, but who later became the cohost of Kotlár's
conspiracy video channel. Fleming and Kotlár wrote a paper about an
analysis of vaccine lots by Soňa Peková, who is a member of a
neo-Theosophical UFO cult called ALLATRA, which looks like a version of
Falun Gong that is targeted against Slavs instead of Chinese people.
ALLATRA's international representative is the American intelligence
expert Egon Cholakian, who called himself a specialist in
disinformation, and who described Scientology as an <span
class="quote">"international pro-democratic organization"</span> that
was unfairly persecuted in Russia. In the same way that Scientology is
teamed up with the Nation of Islam, ALLATRA is teamed up with an African
American masonic lodge called the World's Masonic United Nations.</p>
<p>I first found Couey's YouTube channel because it was linked at the
top of a blog post by Dan Sirotkin.
[<a href=https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/>https://<wbr>h<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>v<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>d<wbr>t<wbr>o<wbr>t<wbr>h<wbr>e<wbr>b<wbr>i<wbr>g<wbr>h<wbr>o<wbr>u<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>.<wbr>com/<wbr>2020/<wbr>01/<wbr>31/<wbr>logistical-<wbr>and-<wbr>technical-<wbr>analysis-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>origins-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>wuhan-<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>2019-<wbr>ncov/<wbr></a>]
Couey discussed the blog post in his first two YouTube videos about
COVID. Dan Sirotkin describes himself as a <span class="quote">"former
NSA counterterrorism analyst"</span>, and he went to college on an NSA
scholarship, but as of 2024 he still lived in the DC area, where the
headquarters of various intelligence agencies are located.
[<a href=https://www.harvard2thebighouse.com/p/the-sars-cov-2-pandemic-begins-and>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>harvard2thebighouse.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>the-<wbr>sars-<wbr>cov-<wbr>2-<wbr>pandemic-<wbr>begins-<wbr>and</a>]
He is also a Jew like George Webb and Paul Cottrell.
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1425424404591284231</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1298767738811318272</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1603861877993476097</a>]
Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Before DRASTIC existed, there was an
original duo...Dan and his dad. And then I found them, and we became
three. DRASTIC was after this."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>jjcouey/<wbr>status/<wbr>1401262466978488320</a>]
So Couey was basically the third member of proto-DRASTIC after Dan and
Karl Sirotkin. I believe McCairn has never been an official member of
DRASTIC, but for example the intro and outro videos for his streams have
been done by FunctionGain, which is possibly an alter ego of Billy
Bostickson who founded DRASTIC.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1677539890370859009>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1677539890370859009</a>,

<p>Christie Laura Grace is another one of the many suspicious people
McCairn is connected to. Her pet topic is LNPs, and she blames just
about everything on LNPs, so she predictably also says that the calamari
clots are caused by LNPs (in the same way that Geoffrey Norman Pain says
that the clots are caused by endotoxin, and Bryan Ardis says that the
clots are caused by snake venom). McCairn said <span class="quote">"I
have covered the LNP's and their propensity for abnormal clots with
Christie Grace on stream multiple times."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1801412652650103294>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1801412652650103294</a>]
Grace and McCairn even appeared as guests on a podcast together to talk
about the clots.
[<a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://<wbr>discernable.<wbr>io/<wbr>confirmed-<wbr>evidence-<wbr>of-<wbr>biological-<wbr>engineering-<wbr>and-<wbr>novel-<wbr>clotting-<wbr>with-<wbr>dr-<wbr>kevin-<wbr>mccairn/<wbr></a>]
In 2023, McCairn, Rixey, and Grace were featured in a video panel hosted
by Philip McMillan, who seems like a disinformation agent because of his
complicity in Greg's ORF hoax.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYCjFViwBWw>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=pYCjFViwBWw</a>]
The first peer-reviewed paper Rixey co-authored was a paper where the
first author was Andrew Zywiec, who has promoted Greg's fake ORFs and
fake HPLC results. McMillan's panel also included Shankara Chetty, who
says that long COVID is caused by snake venom, and who said that the
counterterrorism expert Tau Braun was his guardian angel. One time Rixey
suggested that Chetty had been unfairly reported to his medical board,
so I informed Rixey of Chetty's views on snake venom and his connection
to Tau Braun, but Rixey blocked me in response.
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1936417518283006409>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1936417518283006409</a>]
Christie Grace has said that she <span class="quote">"recorded
experimentation on people"</span> using equipment she received from
Project Veritas, because she was going to be a whistleblower for Project
Veritas.
[<a href=i/christie-laura-grace-project-veritas.jpg>i/<wbr>christie-<wbr>laura-<wbr>grace-<wbr>project-<wbr>veritas.<wbr>jpg</a>]
Her story was never released, but nevertheless Project Veritas is
transparently controlled opposition, so it's suspicious how Grace was
going to be one of their whistleblowers. The DEFUSE proposal document
was originally released on the website of Billy Bostickson, who is
supposed to have received the document from Major Joseph Murphy via
Rixey, but 4 months later the DEFUSE document was released again by
Project Veritas with additional commentary by Major Murphy. Murphy
supposedly found the document in a <span class="quote">"top-secret file
within DARPA's Biological Technologies Office"</span> while he was a
<span class="quote">"Marine Corps officer working with the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency"</span>, but afterwards he went to
work for the Office of Naval Research.

<p>In 2021 Addy Adds ghostwrote a Kindle book for Cirsten Weldon, which
is supposed to have sold about 200,000 USD worth of copies in 3 weeks,
even though I suspect the book was employed to launder money.
[<a href=https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1395768089581608963>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>OneAddyAdds/<wbr>status/<wbr>1395768089581608963</a>,

Cirsten Weldon was part of Charlie Ward's trio of Qtard ladies called
the Charlie's Angels, who also included Mel K and Ann Vandersteel. Webb
and Addy did multiple videos together with the Qtard ladies and Charlie
Ward. On January 6th Ann Vandersteel handed media passes outside the
Capitol Building to Webb and Addy.

Ann Vandersteel was the chairwoman of the Zelenko Freedom Foundation and
the host of Zelenko Report. An early telehealth website which sold
prescriptions for the Zelenko protocol was launched by Jerome Corsi, who
at one point offered a monthly salary of 9,000 USD each to George Webb
and Jason Goodman.

Cirsten Weldon is a former Playboy playmate and Mel K is a former porn

<p>Addy lived on naval bases in Guam and Okinawa, because his mother
worked as a Spanish teacher in schools on the bases. Addy wrote a book
called <span class="quote">"Public Intelligence: The Rise of Synergestic
Truth"</span>, where he profiled his champions of public intelligence
who had been guests on his show, but one of them was the marine
intelligence officer Matt Agorist.

Couey said that his boss at the University of Pittsburgh was a Captain
in the US Navy who worked on nuclear submarines, and who had a security
clearance that required him to take special precautions at the
university, and Couey said that there was talk that he might take over
the lab for a year because his boss was going to be sent on an
anti-pirate mission in Africa.

McCairn's connection to Solution of Scientists</a>
</h2>
<p>In March 2025 McCairn did an experiment where he injected pieces of
Hirschman's clot into the heart of a hamster, which died right after the
injection. He didn't do a public stream about the experiment, but he
only livestreamed it on his Discord.</p>
<p>Wayne Crouch made an infographic about how McCairn killed the hamster
after injecting it with <span class="quote">"our amyloid jab clot
samples"</span>. Crouch said that McCairn was linked to Solution of
Scientists, which is the group that Crouch and Greg Harrison are part
of, and which I'm calling the <span class="quote">"Aussie Quinta
Columna"</span>. Crouch is supposed to be a journalist, but in his
infographic he somehow managed to misspell the words <span
class="quote">"scientist's"</span>, <span
class="quote">"hampsters"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"acess"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hampster.webp width=480>

<p>Wayne Crouch also wrote a Facebook post where he referred to the
people who conducted McCairn's experiment as <span
class="quote">"we"</span>:

</div>
<p>Crouch claimed that McCairn's experiment was proof that <span
class="quote">"we will see the rapid death to the shot
recipients"</span>. But if the hamster died within seconds from the
injection, then why haven't vaccinated people died rapidly yet, even
though years have already passed from vaccination? And anyway, if
McCairn injected protein into the heart of the hamster, it's hardly
comparable to injecting LNPs filled with RNA into a muscle in the
arm.</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025, Tom Haviland wrote a Substack post where he described
McCairn's analysis of the clots.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the>https://<wbr>laurakasner.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>a-<wbr>horrifying-<wbr>breakthrough-<wbr>in-<wbr>the</a>]
Haviland wrote that Greg Harrison was the <span class="quote">"lead
scientist"</span> of a team that was analyzing the clots, and that
Harrison asked Hirschman to send the clots to McCairn, and that Harrison
asked McCairn to check the samples for the presence of prions:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-greg-asked.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Haviland's Substack post had a document attached named
<code>Kevin_<wbr>Mccairn_<wbr>Findings.<wbr>pdf</code>, which described the results of
McCairn's analysis of the clots. The authors of the document were
anonymous, and the document was mysteriously signed by <span
class="quote">"The Researchers"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-signed.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>McCairn told me he was not involved in writing the document. However
one of the authors was probably Greg Harrison, because the document was
formatted in a similar way as Greg's documents. In 2024 Laura Kasner
posted another similar PDF about the clots, where the PDF said that the
<span class="quote">"authors remain anonymous for safety
reasons"</span>, but Kasner wrote that Greg was one of the authors.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://<wbr>laurakasner.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>how-<wbr>the-<wbr>white-<wbr>clots-<wbr>are-<wbr>formed</a>]</p>
<p>The document about McCairn's findings said that <span
class="quote">"ORF-19 and ORF-11 are now functionally implicated in the
induction of prionic seeding"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnorf.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The names of ORFs were written with a hyphen in the document. The
names of ORFs are normally written without a hyphen, but Greg Harrison
and Wayne Crouch have both written the names of ORFs with a hyphen.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22orf-19%22&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=%<wbr>22orf-<wbr>19%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>,

<p>McCairn told me on his Discord: <span class="quote">"You seem
incapable of understanding that I am working independently and the only
link is that is that Greg claims to have done some investigation on the
clots. What he has done has nothing to do with my lab analysis."</span>
But I linked to the <code>Kevin_<wbr>Mccairn_<wbr>Findings.<wbr>pdf</code> document and
I asked him: <span class="quote">"If you're so independent from Greg et
al. then why did they write this report about your findings?"</span> And
McCairn replied: <span class="quote">"I have no idea, and I did not give
them permission to write that report or associate it with me any
way."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a page called <span class="quote">"Prion
Research Investigation Project"</span>, which includes a stock photo of
people in a lab that I thought looked similar to the stock footage in An
Unholy Triad:
[<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/prion-research-investigation-project/>https://<wbr>synapteklabs.<wbr>com/<wbr>prion-<wbr>research-<wbr>investigation-<wbr>project/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>But then I found that McCairn's stock photo came from the same
collection of stock footage that was used in An Unholy Triad:
[<a href=https://elements.envato.com/microbiologist-doctor-taking-a-blood-sample-tube-f-6RYNWUU>https://<wbr>elements.<wbr>envato.<wbr>com/<wbr>microbiologist-<wbr>doctor-<wbr>taking-<wbr>a-<wbr>blood-<wbr>sample-<wbr>tube-<wbr>f-<wbr>6RYNWUU</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock-2.jpg width=500><img src=i/clot-stock-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I thought that the stock photo on McCairn's website might be a clue
that the same people who made An Unholy Triad were also involved in
making McCairn's website. McCairn told me that the page on his website
with the stock photo was made by Chris France, who has also made other
parts of McCairn's website. But when I asked Chris France how he picked
the stock image, he didn't answer me. So the question of whether the
matching stock footage was a coincidence or not is still open.</p>
<hr />
<p>Greg's AI seems to have prophesied the results of McCairn's Rt-QuIC
analysis, because in December 2024 Greg wrote: <span class="quote">"Thx
Kevin, will send you emails with word docs attached in which AI is now
telling us we have identified a new blood-born Amyloid-prion disease.
All is conjecture but AI seems highly convinced we shall soon identify
this new Amyloid-Prion hybrid disease with deep NMR's &amp; RT-QuIC,
plus a few more techniques to properly nail it. Interesting times

Next in December 2024, Greg said that McCairn was soon going to receive
samples of the clots, which Greg called <span class="quote">"our"</span>
samples: <span class="quote">"Thank you Kevin, our embalmer white clot
samples shall soon follow, preserved under Argon/dipped briefly in 70%
ethanol, properly sealed - for both NMR &amp; RT-QuIC amyloid-prion

In March 2025 Greg posted this reply to a tweet about An Unholy Triad:
<span class="quote">"Thank you Wayne &amp; Lisa, Episode 4 will expand
in detail re relative pathogenicity of EACH ORF discovered so far. The
12 embalmers white clots samples provided yesterday to Dr Kevin McCairn

Later after McCairn had presented the initial results of his analysis,
Greg now said that his AI had confirmed the presence of amyloid prions
with a 95% confidence level: <span class="quote">"Yes - confirmed
amyloid-prion presence with 95% confidence level according to our 3 AI
engines in concert with each other...don't ask me which engines, these are

<p>Greg Harrison, Wayne Crouch, and Lisa Johnston are all promoting a
McCairn-style narrative about a coming prion apocalypse. Lisa Johnston
tweeted that <span class="quote">"Planet earth is under attack by
prionic amaloidosis created by man"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/lisarose030387/status/1909497793338917050>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>lisarose030387/<wbr>status/<wbr>1909497793338917050</a>]</p>

<p>Wayne Crouch was credited as the director of the Unholy Triad videos.
The final video in the series presented a scenario of a prion
apocalypse. First vaccinated people started developing calamari clots,
and then prions from the clots ended up in wastewater, and wastewater
carried the prions into the sea. Then the seawater evaporated and formed
into deadly prion rain, and also the prions spread to humans who ate
fish, and in the end all of humanity died:

<img src=i/clot-unholy-prion.webp width=600>
</div>
<hr />
<p>In February 2025 Kevin McCairn appeared on a video panel about the
clots hosted by Steve Kirsch, which also featured Kevin McKernan,
Richard Hirschman, Tom Haviland, and Greg Harrison:
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6k0oav-vsrf-live-164-white-clot-roundtable.html>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6k0oav-<wbr>vsrf-<wbr>live-<wbr>164-<wbr>white-<wbr>clot-<wbr>roundtable.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-vsrf-roundtable.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Kirsch is connected to the story about the clots in multiple ways,
because I believe he was the second person after Jane Ruby who
interviewed Hirschman, and the first person who interviewed Anna Foster
and Cary Watkins, who to my knowledge were the next two people after
Hirschman who said they had seen the clots. Jane Ruby wrote that Kirsch
worked with Epoch Times to put out his own version of the story about
the clots, but they left her evidence out of the story.
[<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1946233270355587511>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>RealDrJaneRuby/<wbr>status/<wbr>1946233270355587511</a>]
The Died Suddenly movie included more footage of Kirsch than any other
person apart from Hirschman. The results of Haviland's first survey were
published by Kirsch, and Haviland supposedly got the idea to do the
survey after he was connected to Laura Kasner in Kirsch's Substack
comments. Kirsch has also hosted two video roundtables about the clots,
and his first roundtable featured two embalmers who I haven't seen
appear elsewhere in alt media. And Kirsch promoted the Unholy Triad
videos on Twitter.
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1905489721654165629>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>stkirsch/<wbr>status/<wbr>1905489721654165629</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1907637107239350612>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>stkirsch/<wbr>status/<wbr>1907637107239350612</a>]</p>
<p>So I thought that McCairn might have somehow become involved with the
clots through Kirsch, because Couey said: <span class="quote">"Steve
Kirsch wanted me to evaluate Kevin McCairn's grant proposal in 2022, and
we had a nice little text exchange on my phone about that. And so there
again, he even offered to send me to Tokyo to help him work, and help
him do those experiments."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpTQNgFCKZw&t=1h30m25s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=QpTQNgFCKZw&amp;<wbr>t=1h30m25s</a>]
So I asked McCairn on his Discord if he was getting paid by Kirsch, but
he told me: <span class="quote">"No money from Kirsch, I did send him a
grant proposal though, he took my grant and proposed a US institute
carry out the work, I didn't see anything beyond that."</span></p>
<p>So perhaps it was a coincidence that McCairn happened to send the
grant proposal to Kirsch, because McCairn doesn't seem to otherwise be
too closely connected to Kirsch.</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 when I compiled evidence on McCairn's Discord that
Greg's ORFs were a hoax, McCairn recognized the ORFs to be fake. Then in
April 2025 Greg Harrison tweeted: <span class="quote">"And at this point
in time, wish to retract my ORF <span class="quote">'rantings'</span>
due to our lack of credible evidence that any of our ORF stuff actually
exists"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Greg21143362/<wbr>status/<wbr>1908007680406589892</a>]
At first I wasn't sure if Greg was joking or if he actually dropped the
ORF hoax, but McCairn told me on his Discord: <span class="quote">"He
has dropped it because I've reamed him out for it and how fucking stupid
it is to be amplifying LLM hallucinations."</span> And he said: <span
class="quote">"And now I'm aware of the LLM nonsense, I have told them
there will be the strictest scientific standards applied, and I will not
have nonsense like that as an attack vector"</span>. So it seems to have
been McCairn who got Greg to drop the ORF hoax, which might serve as
evidence against a hypothesis that McCairn was somehow complicit in
Greg's disinformation operation. But on the other hand the story about
the ORFs was so clearly fake that it not only discredited Greg but also
people associated with him, which would've motivated people associated
with him to tell him to drop the story.</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on his Discord how he first got connected to
Greg, he replied: <span class="quote">"Here <span class="citation"
data-cites="Henjin">@Henjin</span> is a screenshot of first emails, with
time stamps with respect to Greg and Richard. Why don't we start here so
you can order your thinking a little better. As memory serves I was
involved in a Skype call, it was a group of researchers who had been
looking at histological sections of blood from patients that showed
microclotting where they presented their histological findings and I
initially advised them on how to proceed to stain their tissue for
presence of amyloid."</span> And later McCairn also explained: <span
class="quote">"As I recall it was meeting with clinicians who have
worked with Richard to begin to measure and quantify what the clots
were. They were trying to do thioflavin staining, but lacked the
equipment necessary for precise histology. He [Greg] was a part of that
call, I didn't know him but he was obviously co-ordinating with Richard
and the clinician group in Alabhama who are treating amyloidogenic
microclots. As they were making procedural errors in trying to type the
tissue, and I had the facilities available, i offered to process the
tissue properly so that histological staining for amyloids was done
correctly. I have received no money from them to do this or for the
subsequent anlayses I have done using RT-QuIC, SEM/EDX and Raman
spectroscopy. All of those methods have confirmed an amyloidogenic
signature. Does that make sense?"</span></p>
<p>So as of now it's more or less clear that Greg's crew is deliberately
producing disinformation, but it's not yet clear if McCairn is complicit
in their operation, or if McCairn rather got inadvertently involved with
Greg's crew because he volunteered to help with the histological
staining analysis, or because he was looking for samples of the clots to
analyze.</p>
<p>But in the case that the clots are fake, and Harrison and Hirschman
know themselves the clots are fake, then would they trust someone to
analyze the clots who is not in on the scam? People who had presented a
laboratory analysis of the clots before McCairn include Mike Adams, Ryan
Cole, Ana Mihalcea, Clifford Carnicom, Diana Wojtkowiak, Zandre Botha,
Arne Burkhardt, and Greg Harrison. But I believe all of them are
controlled opposition. (I explained why I think Burkhardt and Cole are
controlled opposition on my page about turbo cancer, because the term
<span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was introduced in Burkhardt's
conference, and I believe Cole was the first major person who promoted
the hoax about turbo cancer but who was not German:
<a href=turbo.html>turbo.<wbr>html</a>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025, Philip McMillan did one video about McCairn's analysis
of the calamari clots, one video where he talked about Greg's ORFs and
how McCairn had found that the clots were autofluorescent, and another
video about an AI-generated document that had mystery ORFs going up to
ORF100:</p>
<div>

<hr />
<p>When I asked Grok to list people who have presented a laboratory
analysis of the calamari clots, the first two people it listed were Mike
Adams and Greg Harrison. Grok said that McCairn's Raman and RT-QuIC
analysis was done by <span class="quote">"Harrison's team"</span>,
because Grok cited a Substack post by Nicolas Hulscher, who gave the
impression that McCairn's analysis was done by Greg's team:

<p>Added in June 2025: Over a period of only two days, Greg Harrison
posted all of these tweets that promoted McCairn:

<p>In early 2025 when Greg Harrison was promoting the hoax about the
fake ORFs, his biggest cheerleaders on Twitter were users called
CoyoteSanctuary and RexesRule/CatsRule2023. Both of them also joined
Kevin McCairn's Discord around December 2024, which was after McCairn
had started doing videos with Hirschman and Harrison. Even after I had
posted exhaustive evidence on the Discord that the ORFs were fake,
RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary kept defending Greg's ORFs, and they just
told me that I was crazy or that I was a counterintelligence agent. So I
thought they might have been in on the scam, since otherwise their
behavior of defending Greg's hoax did not seem reasonable:

<p>The Naval Security Group (NAVSECGRU) was an organization within the

intelligence to adversaries. A large part of this is signals
intelligence gathering, cryptology and information assurance. The
NAVSECGRU organization was active from March 1935 to September 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to being part of the Navy, NAVSECGRU was also part of the
National Security Agency's Central Security Service.</p>
<p>The NAVSECGRU organization was transferred to the Naval Network
Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) where its former assets made up the
Information Operations Directorate.</p>

<p>I found a tweet where RexesRule wrote: <span class="quote">"My

<p>An announcement from 2005 said: <span class="quote">"What was
formerly NAVSECGRU has now become NETWARCOM's Information Operations

[<a href=https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html>https://<wbr>coldwar-<wbr>c4i.<wbr>net/<wbr>NSG/<wbr>NNS051005-<wbr>04.<wbr>html</a>]
The announcement also said: <span class="quote">"The IO warfare area is
composed of five core integrated capabilities: Electronic Warfare,
Computer Network Operations, Psychological Operations, Military
Deception and Operational Security."</span> So I asked RexesRule if she
worked for the deception capability or psyop capability of NAVSECGRU,
but she didn't answer me.</p>
<p>Later after I got Kevin McCairn to agree with me that Greg's ORFs
were fake, Greg posted a tweet where he wrote <span class="quote">"And
at this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span
class="quote">'rantings'</span> due to our lack of credible evidence
that any of our ORF stuff actually exists."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Greg21143362/<wbr>status/<wbr>1908007680406589892</a>]
After that, RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary also seem to have conceded
that the ORFs were fake. However that doesn't mean that they couldn't
have been complicit in Greg's operation, because it wouldn't have made
sense for them to keep supporting Greg's hoax after Greg himself had
dropped it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand it's possible that RexesRule was not part of
Greg's disinformation team in the way that Wayne Crouch seems to be part
of a coordinated team with Greg, because the oldest tweet that matched
the query <code>@<wbr>RexesRule @Greg21143362</code> was only posted in
February 2025. And similarly the oldest tweet that matched the query
<code>@<wbr>CoyoteSanctuary @Greg21143362</code> was only posted in December
2024. But before that both RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary had frequently
interacted with Kevin McCairn. So RexesRule seems more like a
cheerleader for McCairn, who started promoting Greg's ORF hoax after
Greg had appeared as a guest on McCairn's stream.</p>
<p>RexesRule has made many meme-style images where she has promoted
Kevin McCairn, and she frequently posts tweets where she asks people to
donate money to McCairn:</p>

</h2>
<p>A user called Mr. Micronicle joined Kevin McCairn's Discord server in
2025. He posted various microscope images on the server, including
images that he claimed showed calamari clots that came from the body of
a dead person, even though he refused to answer me where he obtained the
clots.</p>
<p>Mr. Micronicle said that he took microscope photos of his blood
stained with Thioflavin T, and he showed an image of a fiber-like object
in the blood with a diameter of about 10-20 µm. Then Kevin McCairn said
<span class="quote">"That is the amyloid fibril, good job and nice image
capture"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-microniclefibril.jpg width=722>
</div>
<p>I told McCairn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be an aggregate structure that consists of multiple
fibrils? A single fibril would be much narrower based on what ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Amyloid fibrils are very thin protein aggregates.</li>
<li>Their diameter typically ranges from 7 to 13 nanometers (nm),
regardless of where they form (blood, organs, brain, etc.).</li>
<li>In blood-related diseases like AA amyloidosis or AL amyloidosis,
amyloid fibrils circulate or deposit, and their size remains in that
typical range.</li>
<li>Cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) and atomic force microscopy
studies have shown that some fibrils can be as thin as 6 nm or up to
about 15 nm, depending on the specific protein involved and conditions
of formation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn responded: <span class="quote">"All peptides are aggregate
structures. Depends on the method of aggregation though and their
resistance to proteases as to how we classify them as
pathogenic."</span> But I showed that ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In scientific terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibril</strong> is understood to be a <strong>very
thin</strong>, <strong>elongated</strong> structure, usually <strong>in
the nanometer scale</strong> for diameter (approximately <strong>7-13
nanometers</strong> for amyloid fibrils).</li>
<li>Structures that are <strong>micrometers wide</strong> (especially
<strong>10 micrometers</strong>, which is about <strong>1,000 times
thicker</strong> than a typical fibril) would more accurately be called:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundles of fibrils</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aggregates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fibers</strong> or <strong>fiber-like structures</strong>
(sometimes used when many fibrils associate)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a <strong>10 micrometer</strong>-wide formation would be
considered a <strong>fiber</strong> or an <strong>aggregate of
fibrils</strong>, rather than a single fibril itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"It is a fibril, singular, of
oligomerized amyloidogenic fibrin. That description is correct."</span>
But I showed him that ChatGPT responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In principle, <strong>no</strong> - if you are using a
<strong>standard light microscope</strong>, it would not be possible to
image <strong>a single fibril</strong> of <strong>oligomerized
amyloidogenic fibrin</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>single fibril</strong> (even one formed by fibrin adopting
amyloid-like structure) would have a <strong>diameter of around 6-15
nanometers</strong>, sometimes slightly thicker depending on
conditions.</li>
<li>The <strong>diffraction limit</strong> of optical microscopy
(~200-250 nm) means anything thinner than that cannot be resolved as a
distinct object.</li>
<li>Therefore, under a standard light microscope, what you would see
would be <strong>aggregates</strong>, <strong>bundles</strong>, or
<strong>dense regions</strong> of multiple fibrils - not an isolated,
singular fibril.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"Fibrils (from Latin
<em>fibra</em>) are structural biological materials found in nearly all
living organisms. Not to be confused with fibers or filaments, fibrils
tend to have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nanometers (whereas fibers
are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have diameters
approximately 10-50 nanometers in size)."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Fibril</a>]</p>
<p>McCairn's defense was that the calamari clots were a novel phenomenon
that required a novel vernacular, so it was acceptable for him to use
the word <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> in an unconventional sense.
He told me: <span class="quote">"Trying to use old vernacular to a new
blood prion disorder will lead the spergs like you to blow a fuse, but
you'll just have to put up with it."</span></p>
<p>Then McCairn said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"Nothing
<span class="citation" data-cites="henjin">@henjin</span> is sore that
there have been multiple replications of the same phenomena and that
they satisfy the metrics required to call them amyloidogenic
peptides."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"You mean the
fibrin or other proteins in the clots contain segments that act as
amyloidogenic peptides? It wouldn't make sense to say that the clots
themselves are amyloidogenic peptides."</span> And I pointed out that
ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, <strong>no</strong>, it is <strong>not
accurate</strong> to say that <strong>fibrin clots themselves</strong>
are <strong>amyloidogenic peptides</strong>. Here is the proper
interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>peptide</strong> refers to a <strong>small chain of amino
acids</strong>, typically much shorter than full proteins.</li>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is a <strong>full-length, large polymeric
protein</strong> (~340 kDa before cleavage), not a small peptide.</li>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is a <strong>macroscopic
network</strong> formed by <strong>polymerized fibrin monomers</strong>,
often extending hundreds of micrometers across - not a single molecular
entity or a simple peptide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is <strong>not</strong> itself a
<strong>peptide</strong>. It is a <strong>supramolecular
structure</strong> made of many fibrin molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloidogenic peptides</strong> are <strong>smaller
fragments</strong> or <strong>sequences</strong> capable of forming
amyloid fibrils on their own.</li>
<li>In pathological conditions, <strong>portions of the fibrin
molecule</strong> <strong>become amyloidogenic</strong> - <strong>but
the entire clot</strong> should be referred to as an
<strong>amyloid-rich structure</strong> or <strong>amyloid-like fibrin
network</strong>, <strong>not</strong> as a <span
class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accurate phrasing would be</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="quote">"Fibrin clots can adopt <strong>amyloid-like
structures</strong>."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Amyloid fibrin contains <strong>amyloidogenic
regions</strong> within the fibrin protein."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Pathological fibrin clots exhibit
<strong>amyloid features</strong>."</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then McCairn just said that <span class="quote">"we are dealing with
a novel phenomenon, and as such the current repertoire of nomenclature
does not fit well"</span>. But he wasn't willing to admit that he used
the wrong terminology.</p>
<p>Earlier I had also called him out for saying that fibrin was a
peptide, even though a peptide is a short chain of about 2-50 amino
acids, but fibrin is a polymerized protein product of fibrinogen, and
each fibrinogen unit in turn is made up of 6 proteins that each have a
length of about 400-600 amino acids. McCairn's response was that <span
class="quote">"You should also be reminded that the vernacular peptide
and protein are interchangeable."</span> But I pointed out that ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it would <strong>not</strong> really be correct - even in casual
speech - to call <strong>fibrin</strong> a <strong>peptide</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is <strong>very large</strong> - it's made
by polymerizing fibrinogen, which itself is almost <strong>3000 amino
acids</strong> long.</li>
<li>Even a <strong>single fibrin monomer</strong> (before
polymerization) is <strong>way too big</strong> to be called a <span
class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
<li><strong>Peptides</strong> usually refer to <strong>short
chains</strong> - dozens, or maybe a few hundred amino acids at
most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling fibrin a <strong>peptide</strong> would sound wrong to most
people familiar with biology, even casually. It's much better (and more
natural) to call fibrin a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Polymerized protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Fibrillar protein</strong>, depending on context.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If McCairn sees a random fiber under a microscope, he says the fiber
is an amyloid fibril, in the same way that Mihalcea would say that the
same fiber is a Morgellons filament or a carbon nanotube, and Mike Adams
would say that the fiber is a reptilian nanowire interface
structure.</p>

can see that, right, so my cursor is here, right, like this will stick
out. And if we look at this primary branch here, what you see is -
fibrin should be a long smooth rope-like peptide that essentially just
overlays itself to form the network around which platelets and other
tissues that form a clot - can aggregate, ok. Here what you're looking
at is a - and so, you're looking at very abnormal structural properties
that are standout to someone who's familiar with looking at peptides in

what I would point out to people is that - pay attention to this thicker
filament, right, and um, in biology, often what you see - and that's not
the best example that I can give for people to think about - is often
when you look at a tree, a tree, as you look at the trunk has a sort of
twisting effect to it, right. It sort of starts at the roots, and it
sort of has a rotation to it, as it goes up to form the branch area of
the tree. But the trunk often, if you pay attention to it, you'll see it
has a rotation to it. And generally in biology, I would say it's a
right-hand rotation, it's the right hand rule of thumb, and you can get
into all sorts of metaphysics around electrodynamics and what that - how
that relates to the body. But in this instance, what you're seeing is
that you're seeing a faster twist - so rotations per unit of distance -
than you would expect to see in normal healthy tissue."</span>

<p>He kept saying that fibrin was a peptide, even though fibrin is not a
peptide but a protein. Peptides are short chains of about 50 or fewer
amino acids.</p>
<p>The reason why he said that a twisted shape was somehow
characteristic of misfolded fibrin might be because earlier he claimed a
similar shape was characteristic of microclots made of misfolded fibrin,
even though the twisted fibers he showed under a microscope were likely
not even made of fibrin, but they were probably textile fibers or
cellulose fibers that he misidentified as fibrin. But the so-called
<span class="quote">"primary branch"</span> in his image has an
irregular shape which looks like it might possibly be due to similar
lengthwise twists or torsion, even though it's not clear if that's the
case or not:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-main-branch-torsion.webp width=90>
</div>
<p>The fibers McCairn showed earlier were about 10-30 µm wide, but his
so-called <span class="quote">"primary"</span> branch is only about 2 µm
wide. McCairn has not presented good evidence that a twisted shape would
be a characteristic of structures made out of misfolded fibrin, or that
the twisted shape would occur in different types of structures with
diameters at different orders of magnitude.</p>

The area shown in both images is about 25 µm wide (because the text
<span class="quote">"10.0µm"</span> in McCairn's image means that the
entire scale bar is 10 µm wide, and not that the scale bar consist of 10
segments of 10 µm each). In McCairn's image the strands have a diameter
of about 0.2 to 3 µm, but in the other image even the widest strands
have a diameter of only about 0.3 µm:</p>

McCairn's image, so that had they wide branches with an irregular
structure, I found the image below. Image A shows regular spaghetti-like
strands of fibrin that have a fairly uniform diameter of about 0.1 µm.
But in image B where fibrin was clotted in the presence of the lipid
DPPC, the fibrin formed wide irregularly shaped structures, so some
branches of the structure have a diameter above 1 µm like in McCairn's
image. Image B was described like this: <span class="quote">"In
contrast, in the DPPC MLV suspension the heterogeneous large-pore gels
are formed with thin branched fibers and lipid particles incorporated
into the gel structure (Figure 1, B). The images reveal many free fiber
terminations. Fibers appeared to be highly adhesive forming dense mats
and tight bundles."</span> DPPC is a lipid, and MLV means multilamellar
vesicle which is a type of liposome, so the balls circled in image B are
balls of lipid:

of a fibrinolytic compound, which resulted in the formation of wide
strands with a diameter of about 0.5 to 3 µm:

<p>Under normal physiological conditions, fibrin fibers (the building
blocks of a blood clot) have diameters typically in the range of 50 to
200 nanometers (nm), sometimes up to 500 nm. So 0.05-0.5 µm is
usual.</p>
<p>However, under abnormal or pathological conditions, fibrin fibers can
become thicker, but usually not to the extent of 1 µm, and very rarely
close to 10 µm as single fibers.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Bundles of fibers can easily be 1-10 µm in diameter - but those are
<em>multiple fibers glued together</em>, not single fibrin polymers.</p>
<p>Single fibrin fibers, even under weird conditions, very rarely cross
the 1 µm diameter threshold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However later ChatGPT said that even fibers of fibrin with a diameter
over 1 µm might not necessarily consist of multiple narrower fibers
glued together, but wide fibers might also be formed due to a greater
degree of lateral aggregation in the stage where the protofibrils form
into fibrils:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thick fibrin fibers with diameters over 1 micrometer generally form
through a <strong>similar basic polymerization process</strong> as
regular thin fibers (around 0.1 micrometer), but there are important
differences in how they become thick.</p>
<p>Both thick and thin fibrin fibers start with the <strong>same initial
steps</strong>: thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to create fibrin monomers,
which then align end-to-end to form <strong>protofibrils</strong>, and
protofibrils laterally aggregate to form <strong>fibrils</strong>. In
thinner fibers, this lateral aggregation is moderate - a few
protofibrils come together to form a fibril, and those fibrils form
relatively fine fibers.</p>
<p>For <strong>thicker fibers</strong>, the key difference is that
<strong>more extensive lateral association</strong> occurs. Multiple
protofibrils aggregate side-by-side <strong>more completely</strong>,
and sometimes <strong>additional bundling</strong> happens between
already-formed fibrils. There is evidence that under certain conditions
- such as low fibrinogen concentration, low ionic strength, or altered
thrombin activity - <strong>multiple narrow fibers can clump
together</strong> after initial formation, effectively fusing into
<strong>wider fibers</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, thick fibers (&gt;1 µm diameter) can result from <strong>both
mechanisms</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>More extensive lateral aggregation during initial
assembly</strong>, leading to inherently thicker fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Post-assembly bundling or merging</strong> of multiple
narrower fibers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If indeed McCairn's image does even show a clot that is made of
fibrin, then I don't know if the thickest branches in his image are
bundles of multiple strands of fibrin joined together, or if they are
just single wide fibers of fibrin. McCairn said that his image showed
misfolded fibrin because the branches had an irregular and twisted
shape, and the branches didn't look like smooth spaghetti like regular
fibrin. But maybe the irregular shape was if the branches were made up
of bundles of fibrin and not individual strands of fibrin. (And the
clumping of the strands may have been if for example the fibrin
structure formed in the presence of a lipid or a fibrinolytic compound,
and not necessarily because the fibrin was misfolded.)</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on Discord why his SEM image had such a poor
level of detail, he said: <span class="quote">"The difference in detail
comes from using a graphene base vs glass slide, and other factors,
backscatter acquisition from surface or combined."</span> When I asked
why he couldn't use a graphene base, he said: <span class="quote">"I use
glass to be able run Raman on the same sample."</span></p>
<p>He also posted another similarly blurry SEM image at a 5000-fold
magnification level (but it does seem to be a real SEM image judging
from the EXIF metadata, which even includes the serial number of the
Hitachi TM4000 instrument):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-blurry.jpg width=663>
</div>
<hr />
<p>I initially questioned if McCairn's images were really even taken
with an SEM, because McCairn made it seem like he had bought his own SEM
instrument, which would've seemed like an unnecessarily expensive
purchase, but I didn't see an SEM in his lab in his videos, so I
questioned if he had actually bought an SEM. For example in a video
where he showed his SEM images, he showed a photo of the Hitachi TM4000
SEM, and he said: <span class="quote">"It costs serious money to go and
get this type of data, ok. The machine you're looking at there is
hundreds of thousands of dollars."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6s3wjv-prion-clusters-excess-neuro-burden-in-the-young-promising-therapeutic-lab-d.html?start=6374>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6s3wjv-<wbr>prion-<wbr>clusters-<wbr>excess-<wbr>neuro-<wbr>burden-<wbr>in-<wbr>the-<wbr>young-<wbr>promising-<wbr>therapeutic-<wbr>lab-<wbr>d.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=6374</a>]
And in a tweet he posted before he had done the SEM and Raman analysis
of the clots, he said that the SEM and Raman analysis would cost him
about 150,000 USD, which made me think he was going to buy his own SEM
instrument.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1871484694598238475>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1871484694598238475</a>]
So if his first image at 5,000-fold maginification turned out blurry,
then why didn't he bother taking another image if he paid a lot of money
for an SEM?</p>
<p>But McCairn told me on his Discord that he didn't end up buying his
own SEM instrument, but he visited a lab in Japan to do the SEM and
Raman analysis, and he linked to an old video where he visited the same
lab and used the Hitachi TM4000 microscope.

And he said that the lab time <span class="quote">"averages $1500 a day

</div>
<p>Hirschman also said: <span class="quote">"We've got now Kevin McCairn

uses costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not like you can just

1:16:59] But Hirschman was wrong, because McCairn just visited some
random lab to do the SEM and Raman analysis, and it didn't cost him
hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One of McCairn's followers went around asking billionaires to donate

<p>I think he is using the term <span class="quote">"fibril"</span>
wrong, because ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <strong>"fibril"</strong> is typically used in biology and
materials science to refer to <strong>very fine fibers</strong>, often
in the <strong>nanometer to low micrometer scale</strong> (usually less
than 1 µm in diameter). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrils</strong> are generally <strong>5-15
nanometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Collagen fibrils</strong> are typically <strong>50-500
nanometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure shown in the image, with a diameter in the range of
<strong>10-20 micrometers (µm)</strong>, would more accurately be
described as a <strong>fiber</strong> or <strong>filament</strong>
rather than a <span class="quote">"fibril."</span> A <strong>10-20
µm</strong> diameter is quite large for something labeled as a <span
class="quote">"fibril"</span> in the conventional biological
context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same image was featured on a page of McCairn's website where he
advertised his services for detecting abnormal fibrils. But the text
next to the image looked like an AI was asked to describe what was shown
in the image, which inspires great confidence in his skill in analyzing
abnormal fibrils:
[<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://<wbr>synapteklabs.<wbr>com/<wbr>protocol-<wbr>on-<wbr>sending-<wbr>blood-<wbr>samples-<wbr>2/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>McCairn said that the text was generated with AI by Chris France who
made the website. But McCairn used to advertise his fibril detection
services on almost every stream, and he actually managed to trick
several people into paying him to look for fibrils in their blood, and
his followers went around asking billionaires to donate money to him so
he could improve his fibril detection scheme, so why didn't he even
bother to write the text on his website himself?</p>
<p>The next image shows the same fiber as the previous image, but under
a UV light, where the UV light excites the object to emit visible light
through fluorescence. In fluorescence microscopy the camera captures
only the intensity of the emitted light but not the hue, but the green
tint used in the image is arbitrary, and the image might as well be
displayed in grayscale or with some other tint.</p>
<p>McCairn said that the whole fiber was fluorescent, which he said made
it <span class="quote">"highly likely that we're looking at an amyloid
structure"</span>.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v5zq84w-operation-blue-drone-and-lessons-in-fluorescent-microscopy-amyloid-signals-.html?start=9492>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v5zq84w-<wbr>operation-<wbr>blue-<wbr>drone-<wbr>and-<wbr>lessons-<wbr>in-<wbr>fluorescent-<wbr>microscopy-<wbr>amyloid-<wbr>signals-.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=9492</a>]
But I didn't see him showing if the fiber was already autofluorescent
before he did the ThT staining. On his website McCairn described the
fiber as a <span class="quote">"fibril"</span>, even though in one of
his presentation where he showed a version of the image with a scale
bar, the fiber was shown to have a diameter of about 15 µm:
[<a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://<wbr>discernable.<wbr>io/<wbr>confirmed-<wbr>evidence-<wbr>of-<wbr>biological-<wbr>engineering-<wbr>and-<wbr>novel-<wbr>clotting-<wbr>with-<wbr>dr-<wbr>kevin-<wbr>mccairn/<wbr></a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-3.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>The fiber in the image above has a fold that runs along the middle
lengthwise. When I asked McCairn on his Discord what the fold was, he
said: <span class="quote">"And the fold running length wise is
indicative of it being a coherent structure, that is one of the reasons
why fibril is a fair description of the phenomenon. Again this is you
running into the axiom of those that can and those that can't. This is a
highly unusual amyloidogenic form."</span> And when I said the structure
was too big to be called a fibril, he said: <span class="quote">"And one
could say fibrillar forms, but fibrils is good enough at this stage,
again because of the extremely large size differential between normal
amyloids and these unusual fibrin amyloids."</span> Then I asked someone
else: <span class="quote">"How do you even know that the structures
shown by McCairn and Micronicle are fibrin clots? I think fibrin clots
wouldn't have the kind of lengthwise fold in the middle as McCairn's
green mystery fibril."</span> But McCairn replied: <span
class="quote">"This objection to raw data comes from your years of
extensive lab experience working with amyloids, I presume?"</span> He
also seemed to suggest that the mystery fiber he showed on his website
was the same type of structure as the fiber in Mr. Micronicle's image
(even though Mr. Micronicle's fiber didn't have a lengthwise fold
running along the middle, and it didn't look as flat as the fiber on
McCairn's website).</p>
<p>But anyway, are there even mini calamari clots that float freely in
human blood, and that have a diameter of about 10-30 micrometers and a
length of hundreds of micrometers?</p>
<p>The purpose of fibers of fibrin is to form a web that captures red
blood cells, so then the tangled mess of fibrin and blood cells form a
clot that blocks a punctured blood vessel. The reason why large clots
have elongated shape is because they conform to the shape of a blood
vessel, like if some entangled sticky mess was poured through a tube and
the tube got clogged.</p>
<p>But if there's a micrometer-scale clot of fibrin that floats freely
in the blood, why would it have an elongated shape? Did the clot form
inside a small blood vessel and then get dislodged?</p>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="fibrin-clot-structure-in-situ">1. Fibrin Clot Structure In
Situ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin forms a <strong>mesh or network</strong> of thin fibers
during clot formation, creating a <strong>gel-like matrix</strong> that
stabilizes platelets and red blood cells.</li>
<li>This structure is <strong>highly entangled and irregular</strong>,
not a single, uniform fiber.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shape-of-freely-moving-clots-emboli">2. Shape of Freely Moving

<ul>
<li>When parts of a fibrin-rich thrombus <strong>dislodge and enter

<li>The <strong>shape of these emboli</strong> depends on:</li>
<li><strong>Origin</strong>: Venous thrombi are often <strong>elongated
or serpentine</strong>, as they form in the low-shear environment of
veins.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical deformation</strong>: They may elongate as they
pass through blood vessels.</li>
<li>However, emboli are generally <strong>amorphous, irregular</strong>,
or <strong>elongated masses</strong>, not slender, fiber-like
threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fiber-like-structures">3. Fiber-like Structures?</h3>
<ul>
<li>While fibrin fibers themselves are nanoscale or microscale strands,
a <strong>free-floating clot is a bulk mass</strong> of these fibers

<li>You will <strong>not see individual fibers</strong> moving freely in
the bloodstream in vivo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked McCairn that if the fiber in his microscope image formed
inside a small blood vessel and then got dislodged, then why is it flat,
and why does it have the lengthwise fold in the middle. He provided this
weak answer: <span class="quote">"Good question why does this diseased
protein have the form it does, it should be noted it's not the only form
there are irregular &amp; spheroid forms. I think it comes down to
location of formation, nature of the underlying nano-scale fibril
geometry, the species of protein, fibrinogen which makes long linear
forms. Again we are in a process of discovery and relying on orthodox
frameworks you constrain yourself to being able to competently describe
it. But it's a common form, even described in the published
literature."</span> But I didn't find any paper in the medical
literature that would've described fibrin clots as having a flat
ribbon-like shape with a lengthwise fold running along the middle.</p>
<p>When I asked why McCairn's fiber has the lengthwise fold, ChatGPT
said the fiber might be a fiber of cellulose where the hollow lumen in
the middle has collapsed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lengthwise fold or groove is not characteristic of fibrin or
amyloid aggregates. Instead, it is a <strong>well-known feature of
certain textile or environmental fibers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cotton fibers</strong>: Typically ribbon-like, twisted, and
often show central folds or convolutions due to the collapse of the
hollow lumen inside the natural fiber.</li>
<li><strong>Cellulose fibers (like paper fibers or lint)</strong>: Also
tend to flatten and develop longitudinal folds.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic fibers</strong>: Usually round or oval in
cross-section, smooth, and don't typically have the central fold unless
manufactured with a special cross-section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the ribbon shape, width (tens of micrometers), and the
<strong>longitudinal fold</strong>, this looks much more consistent with
a <strong>collapsed plant-derived cellulose fiber (e.g., cotton
lint)</strong> rather than any protein fibril or clot material.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Added later: I now found the stream where McCairn originally
presented the microscope images of the fiber.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v5zq84w-operation-blue-drone-and-lessons-in-fluorescent-microscopy-amyloid-signals-.html?start=11565>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v5zq84w-<wbr>operation-<wbr>blue-<wbr>drone-<wbr>and-<wbr>lessons-<wbr>in-<wbr>fluorescent-<wbr>microscopy-<wbr>amyloid-<wbr>signals-.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=11565</a>]
He claimed that the fiber came from a sample of blood of someone who was
injured by a Moderna vaccine, which I think meant Lyndsey House. From
the stream you could also see that the end of the fiber had a torn
appearance, which doesn't seem like characteristic of a fibrin clot:</p>

<p>McCairn's post has the air of cheap propaganda because of the
emphasis on harm done to babies. A common trope among morticians in alt
media is that they have a dramatic story to tell about dead babies, like
how the British funeral director Wesley said that there was about ten
times the normal number of babies dying, so the fridges were packed full
of dead babies.

deaths in 2021"</span>, and she saw babies that died of SIDS a few days
after their breastfeeding mother received a COVID vaccine, and that

<p>The focus of McCairn's post was on scary microscope images, which is
reminiscent of content by the Quinta Columna and the Stew Peters crowd.
ChatGPT said that McCairn's post <span class="quote">"strongly resembles
pseudoscientific or hoax material, exploiting scientific-sounding
language and visual data without meeting the necessary standards of
scientific proof"</span>.</p>
<p>In his post McCairn presented the images below, which both show the
same fiber that he supposedly found in the 3-year-old's blood. The
bottom image was taken under a UV light, where the UV light stimulated
the Thioflavin T to emit visible light in the green range, and where the
microscope employed an emission filter that only allowed the green light
to pass through. The microscope captures only the intensity of the light
but not the color, so the green tint employed in the image is arbitrary
(even though it happens to correspond to the wavelength of light emitted
by Thioflavin T).</p>
<p>The bottom image shows that the fiber was fluorescent under a UV
light even before McCairn had applied Thioflavin T on the sample, so
McCairn said that the fiber was autofluorescent:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnsub-2.webp width=570>
</div>
<p>He also showed images of a second similar fiber, and he described the
fibers as <span class="quote">"autofluorescent fibrillar
structures"</span> and <span class="quote">"UV-reactive fibrillar
microclots"</span> and <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin
microclots"</span>.</p>
<p>However just because McCairn's fibers are fluorescent under UV light
doesn't mean that they are <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin
clots"</span>, but they might for example be fibers of cotton, because
in the same way that white clothes are fluorescent under UV light,
fibers of cotton that have been dyed white are also fluorescent under UV
light. (Based on the scale bar in the two images above, the fiber
appears to have a diameter of about 5 µm, but later it turned out that
the scale bar was incorrect and the diameter was actually about 15 µm,
which fits within the typical range of diameter for fibers of cotton,
which is around 12-25 µm.)</p>

<p>One of Greg Harrison's AI-generated documents had similar Markdown

<p>McCairn told me that his post was an AI-generated summary, and that
he left <span class="quote">"the markdown in for transparency"</span>.
But I don't buy his excuse, because the Markdown formatting was not even
a clear sign that his post was generated by AI, and he could've been
much more transparent by explicitly writing that his post was an
AI-generated summary.</p>
<p>The Markdown formatting appeared in the heading of a list titled
<span class="quote">"Clinical Case Summary"</span>, so at first I
thought McCairn meant that only the list was generated by AI based on
the rest of the post, and therefore I was wondering why the list
mentioned details that were missing from the rest of the post. But
McCairn clarified that he meant that the entire post was an AI summary
based on a longer original article:

<p>McCairn supposedly does his blood analysis using slides of blood that
he receives in the mail from his followers, even though it's not clear
if that's how he received the sample of blood of the 3-year-old. I
pointed out that if mini calamari clots are so common that he frequently
finds them in small random samples of blood, there should be vast fleets
of mini calamari clots swimming around in the bloodstream of people. But
he refused to even answer me what volume of blood he analyzed:

microscope images was taken at a 4-fold magnification, but the scale bar
seemed to indicate that the image was taken at a much higher
magnification level:
[<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1927071726300451325>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>mar15164/<wbr>status/<wbr>1927071726300451325</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said that typically <span class="quote">"the field of view
(FOV) for a 4x objective on a standard microscope with a 10x eyepiece is
around 4-5 mm (4000-5000 µm)"</span>, but based on McCairn's scale bar,
the area shown in his image was only about 550 µm wide, which is only
about 12% of the typical FOV:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>But McCairn said he didn't even use an eyepiece, so the FOV at 4x
magnification should be about 40-50 mm, which means that the visible
width of his image is only about 1.2% of a typical FOV.</p>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT if an eyepiece can go up to 100x, it said 100x
eyepieces are extremely rare and not practical for most applications,
and typically eyepieces only go up to about 15x or 20x magnification.
When I asked what could explain McCairn's narrow FOV if the image was
taken without an eyepiece, ChatGPT wasn't able to give any reasonable
explanation. But it did say it was possible that the scale bar was wrong
or the magnification level was reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>McCairn replied to me: <span class="quote">"The field of view is not
0.5mm you cretin, the scale bar shows the pixels derived from the camera
using a calibration slide placed on the slide holder. you are looking at
an amyloidogenic fibril that is 100's of micrometers in length and the
scale bar in red shows 50 micrometers not 0.5mm you moron"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928562639476764916>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1928562639476764916</a>]
But I replied: <span class="quote">"The scale bar is about 9% of the
width of the image, and 50/.09 is about 550 µm. The field of view means
the width visible in the image."</span> And McCairn said: <span
class="quote">"Again you're wrong about calibrating the scope. And
thread sliding trying to get away from the amyloidogenic clot
data."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"How am I wrong? Is the
field of view not about 0.55 mm? If you didn't even use an eyepiece,
then how do you explain that your FOV is only about a hundredth of a
typical FOV at 4x magnification without an eyepiece?"</span> Then
McCairn said: <span class="quote">"No it isn't go back to your
calculations and think how a stained amyloid structure which by the
scale bar is close to 1mm in length fits in that FOV."</span> But I
replied: <span class="quote">"The scale bar is 94 pixels wide, the image
is 1047 pixels wide, and 94/1047 is about 0.090. The area of the fiber
is about 765 by 260 pixels, and (765^2+260^2)^.5/94*50 is about 430 µm
(but the fiber is not perfectly straight, so you can round the length up
to 500 µm)."</span> But after that he just replied <span
class="quote">"Science is moving on henjin"</span> and linked to his new
Substack post. But I told him: <span class="quote">"You still haven't
explained why the FOV is only about 550 µm if the image is taken at
4-fold magnification."</span> But he said: <span class="quote">"lmfao
how is the fov 0.5mm, tell you henjin, get a scope, get a calibration
reticle and see what you come up with. And the amyloid data is pouring
in, suck on my big, fat, juicy <span class="quote">'fibril'</span>. Feel
its scale invariance pounding your tiny sperg hole!"</span> And I asked:
<span class="quote">"Well what is the FOV then, and how are you supposed
to calculate it? Is my calculation of 1047/94*50 wrong?"</span> Then
another user replied: <span class="quote">"have you ever heard of
something called cropping?"</span> And McCairn answered: <span
class="quote">"These things would be beyond henjin, in his dos, html
world."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"So your explanation
for why the FOV is about 1% of a typical FOV at 4x magnification is that
the image was cropped? Did the original image display a 100 times wider
area but you cropped about 1% of the width of the image?"</span> He
didn't answer, but when I later asked the same question again, McCairn
said: <span class="quote">"Irrelevant sperg detail, when you have the
image across 2 different methods and concordance. Simple fact is you
have a large amyloid fibril detected, in the blood, that would fill
clinical criteria for a clot. From nano to macro, the presentation is
parsimonious."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929183581537968191>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1929183581537968191</a>]</p>
<p>In the last tweet I quoted above, McCairn referred to an SEM image of
the 3-year-old's fiber that he had now posted on Substack. His SEM image
was taken at 40-fold magnification, but the object in the image now took
up about 50% of the FOV:
[<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000>https://<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>home/<wbr>post/<wbr>p-<wbr>164833000</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sem-3yearold.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>So why did the same object take up about 75% of the FOV in the other
image that was supposedly taken at 4-fold magnification?</p>
<p>The object in the new SEM image is about 731 pixels wide, and the 1
mm scale bar is about 460 pixels wide, so the width of the area covered
by the object is about 1.59 mm. But in the earlier optical microscope
image, the width of the area covered by the object was only about 0.38
mm based on the scale bar.</p>
<p>Jikkyleaks asked: <span class="quote">"Kevin are your scales correct
on the SEM pic? In the first picture it looks like that fibril is about
500micrometres long, but the SEM scale is marked in millimetres."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928634205245690299>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Jikkyleaks/<wbr>status/<wbr>1928634205245690299</a>]
And McCairn answered: <span class="quote">"Yes they are dead on
accurate, you are looking at the difference between trying to calibrate
off a glass slide reticle that comes from some Chinese sweat shop
vs. the precision delivered by top off the line SEM. The scales are
within the margin of error between the techniques deployed."</span> But
how was it possible for both scale bars to be <span
class="quote">"dead-on accurate"</span>, if they differed by a factor of
about 4?</p>
<p>But anyway, I still didn't have an answer to why the old microscope
image had a FOV of only about 0.55 mm, even though the image was
supposedly taken at 4-fold magnification. So I asked McCairn: <span
class="quote">"So was your 4x image cropped or not? If so then what
percentage of the width of the original image did the cropped image
show? It's probably not nearly enough to explain why the FOV was only
about 0.55 mm even though a typical FOV at 4x magnification would be
about 40-50 mm."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929207032516637023>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1929207032516637023</a>]
He posted a reply where he didn't answer my question, so I asked him
again: <span class="quote">"Was the image cropped or not? It should be a
simple question to answer. Or did you use something like a tube lens or
digital zoom?"</span> But McCairn still didn't answer my question:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929222987800334487>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1929222987800334487</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-4.webp width=550>
</div>
<hr />
<p>McCairn seems to routinely screw up the scale bars in his microscope
images. In this image the scale bar is shown to be 10 µm wide, even
though it's about 13 red blood cells wide, and red blood cells have a
diameter of about 7 µm, which means that the scale bar is really
somewhere around 90 µm wide:
[<a href=https://x.com/Melchizedek1972/status/1964386301186117887>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Melchizedek1972/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964386301186117887</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairn-own-blood-fiber.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>McCairn responded <span class="quote">"Yes the scale bar is wrong it
should say 50 micrometers, the 10 micrometers is a holdover from a scene
done for more detailed analysis for an individual who wanted their blood
looked at."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964578431229890968>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964578431229890968</a>]
However based on the diameter of the red blood cells, the scale bar
seems to be closer to 100 µm than 50 µm.</p>

claimed that he got COVID from the Korean superspreader event 2 to 3
months before the event</a>
</h2>
<p>I have joined Kevin McCairn's Discord server multiple times since
2020, and I was even made into a moderator on the server at one point,
but I have usually left the server after a while because it had a very
low quality of posts. McCairn banned me from the server in May 2025,
because I said that the calamari clots were fake and he was probably
controlled opposition.</p>
<p>Since his early videos in 2020, McCairn has said that he got COVID
from the Korean superspreader event in Daegu, and that he had severe
neurological symptoms, which was a reason why he knew that COVID had a
neurotropic effect and he decided to focus on researching the
neurological aspects of COVID.</p>
<p>However the problem with his story is that the Korean superspreader
event occurred in February 2020, but McCairn says that he was in Daegu
from late November into December 2019. I hadn't seen anyone call him out
for his claim until I brought it up on his Discord:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-earlycovid.webp width=691 height=6062>
</div>
<p>I used to think McCairn probably had some other illness but he
mistook it for COVID, but after I found out how there's also many other
people in alt media who claim that they were among the first people in
their country who got COVID, I started to think it's possible that he
just made up the whole story about having COVID.</p>
<p>It also seemed like an unlikely coincidence that McCairn was an early
YouTube streamer who was focused on COVID, but he also happened to be at
the right place at the right time to get infected with COVID very early
on. Often if a fabulist invents an embellished biography for themselves,
they insert themselves in various locations around the world at a time
when some event of historical importance happens to occur at the
location. But the Korean superspreader event was probably the best-known
event that occurred in Korea in the entire year of 2020.</p>
<p>In the unlikely scenario where McCairn actually got COVID in November
or December 2019, he might have been the first person with COVID in
Japan, because he claims that he was still sick with COVID after he
returned home to Japan in December 2019.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above, I pointed out how on January 28th 2020 UTC,
Steve Pieczenik claimed that a month ago he had the first case of COVID
in the United States, and he got COVID after he met with a Chinese
student from Wuhan (because I guess he didn't count the student as an
earlier case of COVID).
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dq8v0zZpVCCe/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>Dq8v0zZpVCCe/<wbr></a>,
22:08] But how did Pieczenik even know what city the student came from?
At the time Americans were not yet familiar with Wuhan, and it wouldn't
have meant much to Americans what Chinese city the student came from, so
it's not too likely that the topic of the student's home city would've
come up in a conversation. And similarly John Mark Dougan lives in
Russia, where there's only about 20,000 Chinese people in the entire
country, but he claimed that he got COVID after he went to an
immigration office where he saw Chinese people wearing masks.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6qfuOcebagU/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>6qfuOcebagU/<wbr></a>]
So in the same way that Pieczenik happened to conveniently come in
contact with a student from the right Chinese city, and Dougan happened
to convenently come in contact with Chinese people in a country where
there's almost no Chinese people, McCairn also happened to conveniently
visit the city in Korea that was famous for the superspreader event.</p>
<p>I don't know if McCairn actually even visited Daegu in 2019 like he
claims, but in one video he also said: <span class="quote">"I got hit by
the biggest superspreader event in Asia, right early on, in November to
December."</span>

<p>McCairn's American sidekick Charles Rixey also claims that he got
COVID at a time when there were only a few reported COVID cases in the
US:

<hr />
<p>Added later: I didn't find the early videos on McCairn's YouTube
channel archived anywhere, because his first channel was deleted fairly
early on, and his videos were not even archived by AltCensored. But
these were McCairn's earliest videos about COVID I found that were still
available online:</p>

<p>I listened to a couple of the videos above, and I searched through
the transcripts of a few more videos, but McCairn only said he may have
gotten COVID in Daegu in one of the videos, which was a video he did
with Addy Adds in March 2020. In the video McCairn said: <span
class="quote">"And, uh, where I had my lab, which was in South Korea in
a city called Daegu, they'd asked me to sort of come and give a, uh, to
help them in a project they were doing. And that time was October, no,
sorry, November - I want to say it was November into December, but late
November, right. And at that time, um, I came back, and over the
Christmas period, I got really, really ill, right. And, um, it's sort of
left - like the fever I was delirious, so I can't - and again, so I get
memory issues because of the head injury. And so apparently when I was
in the fever bit, I was coming downstairs and thinking days had passed.
And, uh, it, it wasn't, you know, and it took me a week to sort of get
over that. And then I was left just, um, with, it's called dyspnea where
you can't really breathe."</span>

Then Addy asked if McCairn had COVID, and McCairn said yes, and he
talked about how the Shincheonji cult had a church in Wuhan. And then
Addy said: <span class="quote">"There's a group of superspreaders there,
then."</span> And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"Yeah, and I
literally, I literally caught this, um, this illness and, uh,
Shincheonji, it's called. [...] So I think I did get an exposure, because
a lot of my symptoms fit, and it even left me with sort of, uh, angina
and chest pain. And so a lot of these symptoms that people were
describing, I was like, <span class="quote">'oh'</span>."</span></p>

post about SEM images of the 3-year-old's fiber</a>
</h2>
<p>I have pointed out to McCairn that individual fibrils of fibrin have
a string-like shape because their purpose is to form a web that traps
red blood cells. And large blood clots have an elongated shape because
they conform to the shape of blood vessels. But that doesn't mean that
if there is an intermediate-scale formation of fibrin that floats freely
in the blood, like the microclots McCairn supposedly keeps finding in
his blood samples, the formation would also have an elongated
string-like shape, unless for example the formation first develops
inside a small blood vessel and then get dislodged from the vessel.</p>
<p>In McCairn's first Substack post about the 3-year-old's fiber, he
didn't attempt to explain why the fiber would have an elongated shape if
it was a fibrin clot like he claimed. But now in his second post about
the fiber, McCairn provided the following explanation for why the fiber
had a string-like shape:
[<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrils-in-a-post-gestational>https://<wbr>k<wbr>e<wbr>v<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>w<wbr>m<wbr>c<wbr>c<wbr>a<wbr>i<wbr>r<wbr>n<wbr>p<wbr>h<wbr>d<wbr>2<wbr>8<wbr>2<wbr>3<wbr>0<wbr>2<wbr>.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>amyloidogenic-<wbr>fibrils-<wbr>in-<wbr>a-<wbr>post-<wbr>gestational</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These comparisons between nano- and macro-structures highlight the
conserved geometry of pathological amyloidogenesis. This scale-invariant
preservation of fibrillar architecture aligns with prior biophysical
studies demonstrating that amyloid formation follows universal
thermodynamic pathways, forming twisted ribbon-like or lamellar
structures irrespective of protein species or environmental origin
(<a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>Chiti
&amp; Dobson, 2017</a>;
<a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045104>Eisenberg
&amp; Sawaya, 2017</a>). The similarity across scales - from
nanometer-thick fibrils to centimeter-scale clots - suggests a deeply
encoded biophysical template likely seeded by persistent amyloidogenic
peptides, such as SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However I'm not convinced by McCairn's explanation, and I didn't find
any part of the two papers he cited that actually backed up what he
wrote, or that would've explained why amyloid formations on the
micrometer scale would have a string-like shape.</p>

<p>ChatGPT said that IAPP/amylin forms <span class="quote">"sheet-like
or intercellular ribbon deposits"</span>, but IAPP doesn't quality as a
formation with a diameter on the micrometer-scale, because ribbons of
IAPP typically have a diameter of about 10-15 nanometers. Out of the 8
types of formations listed by ChatGPT, only the microclots associated
with COVID had both a string-like shape and a micrometer-scale diameter.
But I couldn't get ChatGPT to cite any source which said that microclots
clots associated with COVID actually had a string-like shape, so ChatGPT
may have been influenced by McCairn's Substack post which I had shown to
it earlier.</p>
<p>I asked McCairn: <span class="quote">"Is there some specific part of
the papers you cited which says that formations amyloid protein have a
tendency to form into a ribbon-like shape in the micrometer
scale?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1928612282696671237>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1928612282696671237</a>]
But he gave me the following non-answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we go again, you are not looking at the canonical amyloidogenic
form, merely based on the size of the aggregations .</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you this? That is why I as the
domain level expert uses the language as I see fit.</p>
<p>Especially when it reacts to all the diagnostic measurements used to
detect amyloids.</p>
<p>ThT Fluorescence, SEM structural characteristics, RT-QuIC reactivity,
Raman Spectra confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied: <span class="quote">"You suggested amyloid structures have
a <span class="quote">'scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar
architecture'</span> so they have a tendency to form into a ribbon-like
shape on the micro-scale, and you cited two papers from 2017. Which part
of the papers supports your point?"</span> But he didn't answer me.</p>
<p>A paper by Pretorius and Kell featured the images of microclots
below, which had a globular or blob-like shape, but they didn't look
anything like the fibers that McCairn finds under a microscope:
[<a href=https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4507472/v1>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>researchsquare.<wbr>com/<wbr>article/<wbr>rs-<wbr>4507472/<wbr>v1</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pretorius-kell-microclot.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>I asked Douglas Kell if his group had seen the kind of fiber-like
microclots that were shown in McCairn's Substack post, but he just
replied <span class="quote">"these experiments are quite different so
comparisons are not usefully made"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/dbkell/status/1928858289166561296>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>dbkell/<wbr>status/<wbr>1928858289166561296</a>]
Then I asked him: <span class="quote">"McCairn supposedly finds these
mystery ribbons on slides of blood he receives in the mail from his
followers. Have you also tried looking at samples of blood under a
microscope to see if they contain similar formations, or if they contain
amyloid microclots?"</span> But Douglas Kell told me: <span
class="quote">"We have only studied plasma"</span>.</p>
<p>Then McCairn wrote:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928898424038109639>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1928898424038109639</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the experiments conducted by <span class="citation"
data-cites="dbkell">@dbkell</span> and colleagues, the whole blood is
spun in a centrifuge, larger aggregates would be pulled to the bottom of
the tube.</p>
<p>Spinning and looking at the plasma phase would leave the smaller
amyloidogenic seeds in the plasma phase. This allows automated sorting
through techniques like flow cytometry. This is a better approach for
batch processing, you will miss the larger aggregations due to
centripetal forces being greater on larger amyloidogenic forms.</p>
<p>Slide analysis is much slower, requires someone with trained eyes, is
labor intensive, and requires the follow on tests of ThT staining,
SEM/EDX, Raman Spec, for categorization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However if vaccinated people are now suffering from a novel pathology
where their blood is full of clots that look like textile fibers, then
is there anyone except McCairn who has published an image of one of the
clots? I didn't find any similar images of clots published by Pretorius
and Kell. Similar images of fibers in blood have been presented by Ana
Mihalcea, Shimon Yanowitz, David Nixon, people at Burkhardt's pathology
conference, and Mr. Micronicle, even though to my knowledge none of
those people claimed that the fibers were clots made of fibrin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: I now asked McCairn again that when he cited the
two papers from 2017, what part of the papers supported his claim that
aggregates of amyloid protein tend to organize into a ribbon-like shape
on the micrometer scale.
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929356877130838498>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1929356877130838498</a>]
But he now quoted the following paragraphs from the other paper:
[<a href=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>https://<wbr>doi.<wbr>org/<wbr>10.<wbr>1146/<wbr>annurev-<wbr>biochem-<wbr>061516-<wbr>045115</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These β-structured oligomers are able to grow further by
self-association or through the addition of monomers, often with further
and sometimes dramatic structural reorganizations, to form well-defined
fibrils with cross-β structure and a high level of structural order
(Figure 1). Alternatively, the disordered aggregates or native-like
aggregates can grow without any major structural conversion and give
rise to large amorphous deposits or native-like assemblies,
respectively, retaining the structure characterizing the initial
oligomers (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Such large aggregates, including amyloid, amorphous, or native-like
assemblies, have links with human disease as they accumulate in
well-defined pathological states. Tables 1 and 2 list the proteins and
the disorders that have now been identified to be associated with the
formation of amyloid fibrils or other types of aggregates, respectively.
(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 also list, for each protein, references
reporting the identification of the protein in the aggregates and the
characteristics of the aggregate type.) We have arranged both tables in
terms of proteins rather than disorders to stress the fact that many of
these proteins have been found to be involved in a variety of
pathological conditions. Interestingly, immunoglobulins or their
subunits are found in all the different types of protein aggregates,
including amyloid (as in light-chain amyloidosis), amorphous (as in
light-chain deposition disease), and native-like (as in Berger disease)
structures, thus representing a remarkable manifestation of the
multiplicity of pathways existing in protein aggregation and of the
structures and morphologies that can be generated (24-26). Those
proteins that form intracellular inclusions of types that are still
debated, such as TDP-43 and p53, are included in Table 2 with a footnote
explaining this uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I pointed out that Figure 1 illustrated typical nano-scale
amyloid fibrils, and not micrometer-scale amyloid formations. And in
Supplemental Table 1, the shape of various types of amyloid structures
was characterized as <span class="quote">"intrinsically
disordered"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-intrinsically.webp width=660>
</div>
<p>Then McCairn replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're so retarded! This particular amyloid, is novel and not listed
because you're looking at science being done in real time.</p>
<p>The principles of misfolding though, are likely the mechanism leading
to the macroform and of course the species of protein undergoing change.
Fibrin is inherently primed to make macromolecular structures, hence the
amyloidogenic form is going to be larger.</p>
<p>Which is why I have gone to the effort of showing concordant
structure across scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I told him: <span class="quote">"Post-COVID clots are not relevant
to my question. You cited two pre-COVID papers to support a claim that
amyloid aggregates have <span class="quote">'scale-invariant
preservation of fibrillar architecture'</span> and they form <span
class="quote">'twisted ribbon-like or lamellar structures irrespective
of protein species'</span>."</span> And McCairn replied: <span
class="quote">"That's because there is no post-COVID manuscripts showing
the phenomenon, in the manner that I have, you're looking at it being
made right now, and disseminated to the public. It is usual in
scientific writing to point to key historical citations that demonstrate
concordance within hypothetical frameworks."</span> But he still didn't
answer my question, so I told him: <span class="quote">"We already know
you claim that baby calamari clots have a tendency to form into a
ribbon-like shape on the micrometer scale. The question was which part
of the sources you cited supports the claim that the same applies to
other types of amyloid formations."</span></p>
<p>But then McCairn said <span class="quote">"there is a coherency in
the epistemological grounding of the amyloid PRION formation"</span>, so
I told him that it sounded like great pseudo-profound bullshit, because
the pseudo-profound bullshitters are always talking about epistemology:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929507781163524103>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1929507781163524103</a>]</p>

<hr />
<p>DopplerEffect93 is a user on Twitter who has a PhD degree in
neuroscience, but he said that the string-like object in McCairn's
microscope image was too big to be an aggregate of amyloid protein, and
the object looked like dust or debris. McCairn cited a paper by
Pretorius and Kell which said that <span class="quote">"the fibrinaloid
microclots that we observe are typically in the range 1-200 µm on their
longest axis"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1930402739089223987>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1930402739089223987</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-kell-microclotsize-1.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>However the text he quoted referred to this figure, which showed that
the microclots described by Pretorius and Kell did not have a
string-like shape:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-kell-microclotsize-2.webp width=520>
</div>
<p>In another tweet DopplerEffect93 said: <span class="quote">"My
current project at my postdoc (I am working on a poster for it now) is
to investigate TMEM106B amyloid fibrils and use digital whole slide
analysis look at its level and localization in cell types based on
different levels of cerebrovascular disease."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/DopplerEffect93/status/1930680609212424271>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>DopplerEffect93/<wbr>status/<wbr>1930680609212424271</a>]
McCairn's analysis would similarly be ridiculed by other people with
actual domain expertise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: CHD posted a video where Suzanne Humphries said
that when she looked at the contents of a vaccine vial under a
microscope, she saw structures that looked like circles and squares, and
they transformed into structures that looked like circuit boards:
[<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1934672856232726843>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>ChildrensHD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1934672856232726843</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-humphries-4.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Under replies to the tweet, some random users posted about microscope
images that they apparently thought were related to the discovery by
Humphries. They included images of a chip-like structure shown by people
in Burkhardt's pathology conference, graphene disks found by Zandre
Botha, and the amyloid fibril that McCairn supposedly found in the blood
of the 3-year-old (but a common denominator between Burkhardt, Botha,
and McCairn is that they have all presented a laboratory analysis of the
calamari clots):</p>

</div>
<p>The tweet about McCairn's amyloid fibril was posted by a user called
PinkBeachGirl1, which looks like a bot. It has posted almost 200,000
tweets:

</div>
<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: McCairn now did a stream where he looked at the
contents of a Moderna vaccine vial under a microscope. He saw these
fiber-like structures that were autofluorescent under UV light, and he
said <span class="quote">"If I saw that in blood, I'd be like, uh, that
looks suspect"</span>:
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6vgvsh-precipitating-botox-brain-sasha-latypovas-nanobots.html?start=7209>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6vgvsh-<wbr>precipitating-<wbr>botox-<wbr>brain-<wbr>sasha-<wbr>latypovas-<wbr>nanobots.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=7209</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>He said he didn't know what the fluorescent fibers were, but he said:
<span class="quote">"And the problem with there being bacterial
contamination - I don't know how much those fibrous mats are like
bacterial hydrogels in this instance."</span> [2:05:23] He also showed
that his Moderna sample contained this fiber-like structure that was
fluorescent when stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-2.webp width=1100>
</div>
<p>And he showed this structure that he described as a filament, which
was also fluorescent when stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Therefore McCairn's finding of an <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibril"</span> in the blood of the 3-year-old may have also been a false
positive:
[<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1938825698237661541>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>mar15164/<wbr>status/<wbr>1938825698237661541</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-4.webp width=596>
</div>
<p>McCairn's new discovery reminded me of the mysterious fibers that
were supposedly discovered in a Moderna vaccine vial by Carrie Madej:
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>52/<wbr>288</a>]</p>

<hr />
<p>This Twitter user also pointed out that amyloid fibrils are
nano-scale structures:

<hr />
<p>In a video in 2022, McCairn showed the microscope image by David
Nixon below, and McCairn said: <span class="quote">"Everything that I
see here is cholesterol, and literal fibers that you pick up in dust in
the air. What I've seen these people do - they're not doing it in clean
rooms - and you've gotta be in exceptionally clean rooms to make sure

that these are graphene internet fiber optic cables."</span>

But if he saw the same image in 2025, he would probably declare that the
fiber is an amyloid fibril:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fiberoptic.webp width=600>
</div>
<hr />
<p>McCairn's Substack post was titled <span class="quote">"Amyloidogenic
Fibrils in a Post-Gestational Case of mRNA Vaccine Exposure: Structural,
Pathophysiological, and Biosecurity Perspectives"</span>. So the title
didn't employ the term <span class="quote">"amyloid fibril"</span>,
which is a standard scientific term that refers to nano-scale
structures, but the title rather employed the nonstandard term <span
class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibril"</span>, which might plausibly refer
to something other than the typical meaning of an <span
class="quote">"amyloid fibril"</span>. In the post McCairn also referred
to the so-called <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibril"</span> as an
<span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibril formation"</span>, a <span
class="quote">"fibrillar formation"</span>, a <span
class="quote">"fibrillar aggregate"</span>, and a <span
class="quote">"macro-fibrillar form"</span>.</p>
<p>However Nicolas Hulscher's tweet about the post said <span
class="quote">"BREAKING: Amyloid Fibrils Found in 3-Year-Old After
In-Utero mRNA Injection Exposure"</span>. A few days later when Hulscher
wrote a Substack post based on McCairn's post, he also employed the term
<span class="quote">"amyloid fibrils"</span> in the title: <span
class="quote">"BREAKING: Prion-Like Amyloid Fibrils Found in 3-Year-Old

And Hulscher's banner image for the post included text that said <span
class="quote">"detection of amyloid fibrils at age 3"</span>.</p>
<p>The great junk amplifiers SenseReceptor and toobaffled also said that
McCairn found <span class="quote">"amyloid fibrils"</span> in the sample

<hr />
<p>McCairn linked to a ChatGPT conversation where he uploaded his images
of the 3-year-old's fiber, and he asked if the fiber conformed to <span
class="quote">"known amyloidogenic fibrillar forms of fibrin"</span>.
[<a href=https://chatgpt.com/c/689ecab9-9ba0-8326-a605-6c1420ac3614>https://<wbr>chatgpt.<wbr>com/<wbr>c/<wbr>689ecab9-<wbr>9ba0-<wbr>8326-<wbr>a605-<wbr>6c1420ac3614</a>]
ChatGPT told him the structure was a <span
class="quote">"macro-fibril"</span>: <span class="quote">"Native fibrin
typically exhibits 50-200 nm filament bundles; here we see a
<em>macro-fibril</em> several microns wide, suggesting lateral fusion of
many protofibrils into a ribbon-like band - a known amyloid fibrin
phenotype."</span> ChatGPT also told McCairn: <span class="quote">"This
shifts the interpretation from <span class="quote">'probable'</span> to
<span class="quote">'confirmed presence'</span> of β-sheet-rich amyloid
fibrin macrofibrils."</span></p>
<p>The diameter of the 3-year-old's fiber is about 10-20 µm based on the
scale bar in the SEM image. When I asked ChatGPT what the diameter of
amyloid macrofibrils was, it said the diameter was typically 50-200
nm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amyloid <strong>macrofibrils</strong> are higher-order bundles of
smaller amyloid fibrils. Their diameter depends on both the protein type
and the aggregation environment, but in published measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single amyloid fibrils</strong>: ~6-12 nm diameter (core
β-sheet cross-section)</li>
<li><strong>Protofibrils</strong>: ~2-5 nm (precursors before mature
fibril)</li>
<li><strong>Macrofibrils</strong>: typically <strong>50-200 nm</strong>,
but sometimes up to <strong>500 nm</strong> in thick bundles seen in
plaques or clot-associated aggregates</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alzheimer's Aβ plaques: macrofibrils often 80-150 nm</li>
<li>Serum amyloid A (AA amyloidosis): bundles 50-200 nm</li>
<li>Amyloid-rich fibrin(ogen) clots: ribbon-like macrofibrils up to a
few hundred nm wide, occasionally merging into micron-scale sheets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In his Substack post, McCairn also wrote that the 3-year-old's fiber
was a <span class="quote">"macro-fibrillar form"</span>.

It reminded me of the structure that Youngmi Lee called a <span
class="quote">"macronanobot"</span> even though it was visible under an
optical microscope.

<hr />
<p>In McCairn's second Substack post he showed optical microscope images
of the 3-year-old's sample, and he indicated that he was next going to
run SEM, EDX, and Raman on the sample: <span class="quote">"Guardians
were explicitly briefed on the scope and purpose of data collection, the
nature of imaging techniques employed (including UV fluorescence
microscopy, Thioflavin T staining, preservation for SEM/EDX analysis,
and Raman Spectroscopy), and how the data would be analyzed and
disclosed."</span>
[<a href=https://substack.com/&#x40;kevinwmccairnphd282302/p-164383206>https://<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/@<wbr>k<wbr>e<wbr>v<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>w<wbr>m<wbr>c<wbr>c<wbr>a<wbr>i<wbr>r<wbr>n<wbr>p<wbr>h<wbr>d<wbr>2<wbr>8<wbr>2<wbr>3<wbr>0<wbr>2<wbr>/<wbr>p-<wbr>164383206</a>]
McCairn also wrote: <span class="quote">"A total of 31 micrographs were
generated from one glass slide sample. The majority were imaged using
autofluorescence under UV excitation only to avoid chemical interference
and preserve structural integrity for scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, and Raman
Spectroscopy."</span></p>
<p>However in his third Substack post, McCairn only posted SEM images of
the sample, but he didn't describe the results of EDX or Raman analysis.
When I asked him if he had been able to determine if the fiber was made
on fibrin, he didn't answer me, and when I asked if he had done the EDX
or Raman analysis, he only said the sample was on a glass slide so he
couldn't do Raman, but he might later attempt to transfer the sample to
a quartz slide to do Raman:

<p>A month earlier when I asked McCairn if he had been able to determine
if the 3-year-old's fiber was made of fibrin, he told me that he was
still working on the samples, but that <span class="quote">"For the
moment, they remain ThT and phenotypically positive"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-falsepositive.webp width=595>
</div>
<p>So I asked him if he had now run additional tests to determine if the
fiber was made of fibrin or not, but he indicated he hadn't done
additional testing and he hadn't confirmed that the fiber was fibrin:

<p>McCairn responded to my tweets by doing a stream where he said that
he had in fact done EDX on the 3-year-old's fiber, but I don't know why
he didn't answer me earlier on Twitter when I asked several times if he
had done EDX. He showed the image below, and he said: <span
class="quote">"What do we see when we look at Baby B with SEM/EDX? So -
high-level focusing - carbon and oxygen, silicon is the glass-slide.
Chlorine, whatever, I'd say that's salt from the saline in the blood and
the dye I've dropped on it. Here we can see the elemental
signatures."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-edx.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next he showed the image below, and he said: <span class="quote">"And
there's the Raman signature that we have for it. And, um, carbon,
chlorine - there's other ones not labeled here, but there's oxygen,
phosphorus, [unintelligible]. What I would expect to see. And it's
normal elemental signature"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-edx-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>I don't know why he said his plot showed a Raman signature, because
the plot was an EDX spectrum plot. Grok said: <span class="quote">"The
plot in the image appears to be an Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectrum, not a Raman spectrum, based on its axes (energy in keV on the
x-axis, which is characteristic of X-ray spectroscopy for elemental
analysis, rather than Raman shift in cm⁻¹)."</span> And Grok said a
reason why someone might confuse EDX with a Raman spectrum is that <span
class="quote">"Raman spectroscopy and EDX are both used in materials
characterization to produce <span class="quote">'spectral
signatures'</span> (unique peak patterns that act like fingerprints for
identification). Someone unfamiliar with the specifics might
interchangeably use <span class="quote">'Raman'</span> as a generic term
for any spectroscopic plot, especially if they've encountered Raman more
often in biological or chemical contexts (e.g., analyzing biomolecules
like proteins in clots). Raman is popular for non-destructive molecular
analysis, while EDX is for elemental composition, but the visual
similarity of peaked spectra could lead to this slip."</span></p>
<p>Next McCairn showed the SEM image below, where he said that the
3-year-old's fiber was <span class="quote">"connected to these
microclots at either end"</span>, even though the string doesn't even
look like it's connected to the blobs at the end, and I don't know how
McCairn was able to determine that the blobs were microclots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-connected-microclots.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next at time 2:22:15, McCairn said: <span class="quote">"One of these
exchanges you have - I've had to have - with henjin - is what I call
phenotypically similar or different. So does it have the features that I
would expect to see from canonical microclots - like, examples - let's
see if I find a quick example of microclots from someone else. So this
is a microclots from a Moderna-injured blood sample, taken in the
laboratory, and basically showing the same ribbon-like and twisting
features."</span> And he showed this image:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The fiber he showed is flat and it has a lengthwise fold running
along the middle, so it looks different from the other fibers McCairn
has claimed are fibrin clots, which have had a more cylindrical shape so
they looked like strings or twigs, and which didn't have the lengthwise
fold. If the scale bar in his image is accurate, then the flat fiber has
a diameter of about 15 µm, which is similar to the diameter of other
fibers that McCairn has claimed are fibrin clots. But McCairn hasn't
presented a sufficient explanation for why one of the fibers would have
the lengthwise fold but not others.</p>
<p>Next McCairn showed the image below, and he said: <span
class="quote">"To me - like, I wanna say, are they connected? Or are
they aggregating together around the same - the same structure."</span>
And he pointed to the blob at the top and said: <span class="quote">"And
then there's this clot up here, which isn't too visible until you do the
Thioflavin staining, and then you see this sort of cluster."</span> But
I think the blobs don't look connected at all to the string:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next he again showed the SEM image and said: <span class="quote">"You
can kind of see with the electron microscopy, there's like a shadow
between them. And are they connected, right, together? Are they a part
of the same structure? And where you have these tools, the light gray -
the background changes right here, right. This is where you need the
sensitivity signals."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-3.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Next as an example of what he meant by phenotypic similarity, he
showed the image below, and he said: <span class="quote">"Here, where
you see this twisting - which is what amyloids do - when you look at the
sort of computer modeling of them, there's a sort of limit to the width
that they can take. And they can braid to some extent, right, so they're
not like a molecule thick. So they're able to sort of aggregate together
and make a twisting braid."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-4.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Earlier McCairn said that in his SEM image with a 5,000-fold
magnification level, the reason why large <span class="quote">"main
branch"</span> in the structure looked twisted was because of protein
misfolding.
[<a href=#Scanning_electron_microscope_images_of_fibrin_clots>#<wbr>Scanning_<wbr>electron_<wbr>microscope_<wbr>images_<wbr>of_<wbr>fibrin_<wbr>clots</a>]
But the branch was about 3 µm wide, and individual fibrils of fibrin are
only about 0.1 µm wide, so even if the individual fibrils would have a
twisted shape, the aggregate structure with a 30 times bigger diameter
wouldn't necessarily also look twisted. But now McCairn seems to be
saying that a similar twisted shape is a characteristic of even larger
fibers with a diameter of about 15 µm.</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on Twitter if he had done Raman spectroscopy on
the 3-year-old's fiber, he said he couldn't do Raman on the sample
because the sample was on a glass slide, but he needed a quartz slide to
do Raman. So I asked him if he couldn't have asked for another sample of
blood on a quartz slide, but in his stream he now answered me: <span
class="quote">"His sample was very very precious, right. One, it's from
a 3-year-old child. You do not want to go doing interventions on a child
unnecessarily. Unfortunately for that child, he has had many
interventions medically because of the condition he's in."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6yarfu-schizoid-spiral-saturday-the-henjin-files.html?start=6876>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6yarfu-<wbr>schizoid-<wbr>spiral-<wbr>saturday-<wbr>the-<wbr>henjin-<wbr>files.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=6876</a>]
But that sounds like a fake excuse, and I don't think it would've been
too much of a major intervention to prick the boy's finger for a second
time. McCairn also said: <span class="quote">"What the guardians of Baby
B asked was that if I find something, make that something
public."</span> But if the boy is even real, wouldn't his parents have
wanted to make sure that McCairn didn't misidentify the fibers in the
blood? And would the parents have wanted Frank Bergman to issue a red
alert and claim that the fiber was a <span class="quote">"fibrous
clot"</span>, if it was actually a cellulose fiber from dust?</p>
<p>McCairn's evidence that his fibers are made of <span
class="quote">"amyloid fibrin"</span> seems to mainly consist of
fluorescence under UV light with ThT staining, autofluoresence under UV
light without any staining, and <span class="quote">"phenotypic
similarity"</span> (which includes a twisted shape, and being embedded
within the blood and not resting on top of the dried blood). So in other
words his evidence is extremely weak.</p>
<hr />
<p>ChatGPT told McCairn that the EDX results of the 3-year-old's fiber
were not consistent with cellulose or synthetic fibers:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyedx.webp width=650>
</div>
<p>McCairn also asked ChatGPT to analyze his confocal microscopy
results:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyedx-2.webp width=650>
</div>
<p>McCairn said that <span class="quote">"I do EDX as standard when
using the machine"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1962253654590918916>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1962253654590918916</a>]
The SEM and EDX results he showed in his video were combined into a
single PDF file of output, so I guess when he went to the lab to do SEM,
he did EDX at the same time. However it's still suspicious that earlier
when I asked McCairn at least 5 times if he had done EDX on the sample,
and if so then why he hadn't published the results, he never answered
me.

<p>I also asked him multiple times which tests he had done on the
sample, but he didn't say anything about having done confocal
microscopy. And I don't remember him having presented either the EDX or
confocal microscopy results earlier, even though I might have missed it
because I haven't seen all of his streams.</p>
<p>It's possible that his EDX results are real, and his fiber is made of
human protein, but even then the protein might not necessarily be
fibrin. I think McCairn has still not provided sufficient evidence that
the fibers he finds are actually made of fibrin.</p>
<p>I don't even know any other person besides McCairn who claims to have
found string-like fibers of fibrin in human blood. The microclots in the
images by Pretorius and Kell don't appear to have a string-like shape.
If string-like clots of fibrin are now ubiquituous in human blood
because of COVID vaccines, and if McCairn has found the clots in several
samples of blood from random people, then it shouldn't be too difficult
for other people to find the clots. So therefore I would like to see
McCairn's findings verified by some neutral person who is not part of
the anti-vaccine movement, and who is not the host of a conspiracy video
show. McCairn is especially suspect because of his connection to Greg
Harrison, who I have busted producing blatant disinformation about the
clots.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I asked McCairn if he had taken SEM images of the 3-year-old's
sample at a higher magnification, he posted this image at a 5,000-fold
magnification, which I believe he had not published anywhere earlier:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964615823949267279>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964615823949267279</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>I didn't find any region in the lower-magnification images that
looked similar to the new image at 5,000-fold magnification. McCairn
told me the new image was supposed to show a part of the 3-year-old's
fiber, but he refused to say which part it was:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964657152897024470>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964657152897024470</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x-2.webp width=593>
</div>
<p>McCairn wasn't even able to answer what part of the 5000x image
showed the fiber and what part showed the background:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964682263737802949>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964682263737802949</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x-3.webp width=595>
</div>
<hr />
<p>The cotton fiber in this image has the same type of torsion as the
3-year-old's fiber, which McCairn claimed was a characteristic of
microclots made of amyloid fibrin:
[<a href=https://tricliniclabs.com/reference-material/downloadable-documents/APPLICATION_NOTE-CONTAMINANT-IR-FIBROUS-ID-MAY-2023.pdf>https://<wbr>tricliniclabs.<wbr>com/<wbr>reference-<wbr>material/<wbr>downloadable-<wbr>documents/<wbr>APPLICATION_<wbr>NOTE-<wbr>CONTAMINANT-<wbr>IR-<wbr>FIBROUS-<wbr>ID-<wbr>MAY-<wbr>2023.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sem-fiber-materials.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In fact the 3-year-old's fiber is consistent with a cotton fiber in
terms of its diameter, flatness, and the torsion. Cotton fibers are also
flat, and their diameter is typically about 12-25 µm:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cotton-fiber-comparison.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT to list morphological characteristics of cotton
fibers, one of the features it listed were the torsion-axis twists that
are called <span class="quote">"convolutions"</span> in cotton:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape</strong>: Each fiber is a flattened, twisted, and
ribbon-like structure. The twists, called <em>convolutions</em>, are a
distinguishing feature of cotton.</li>
<li><strong>Length</strong>: Fibers are relatively long compared to
other natural cellulosic fibers. Depending on species and variety, they
range from about <strong>10 mm to 60 mm</strong>, with commercial cotton
typically between <strong>20-40 mm</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Diameter</strong>: The width of a fiber is usually
<strong>12-25 micrometers</strong>, tapering towards the tip.</li>
<li><strong>Surface</strong>: The outer wall is smooth but shows
irregular twists along its length.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-section</strong>: The fiber cross-section is generally
kidney-shaped or oval with a hollow center (<em>lumen</em>). The lumen
collapses as the fiber matures, contributing to its twisted form.</li>
<li><strong>Fineness</strong>: Cotton fibers are relatively fine, which
contributes to softness and comfort in textiles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's another image that shows how a distinguishing feature of
cotton fibers are the lengthwise twists that are called <span
class="quote">"convolutions"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fiber-types.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>McCairn might also do a similar side-by-side comparison, where he
would show microscope images of different types of fibers next to his
supposed microclots.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn posted these microscope images of cotton fibers:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964863856054051121>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1964863856054051121</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairn-cotton.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>In the second tweet above, the two images on the top row show the
3-year-old's fiber and the two images on the bottom row show cotton
fibers.</p>
<p>I pointed out to McCairn that his images of the 3-year-old's fiber
were taken at such low magnification that it's not easy to tell if the
fiber had lengthwise striations. You can't even see it from the 200x SEM
image, and the 5000x SEM image doesn't show any part of the fiber as far
as I can tell.</p>
<p>For example this cotton fiber looks fairly smooth, and the striations
are so subtle that they would not necessarily be visible at a 10-fold
magnification with an optical microscope (even though there's another
more prominent line running through the surface on the fiber to the
bottom right of the lines I highlighted, so I don't know if McCairn
meant that type of lines by <span
class="quote">"striations"</span>):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cotton-striation.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The difference in appearance between the fibers might partially be
explained by a difference in dying, ThT staining, or other properties.
For example typically white clothes are more strongly fluorescent under
UV light than black clothes. ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural, undyed cotton is not strongly fluorescent under ultraviolet
(UV) light, although it can exhibit a faint blue-white fluorescence due
to trace impurities such as residual waxes or processing agents. Raw or
unbleached cotton typically shows a dull yellowish or weak blue
fluorescence caused by natural pigments like pectin and
xanthophylls.</p>
<p>Bleached white cotton, on the other hand, often fluoresces brightly
with a blue-white glow because optical brightening agents (OBAs) are
commonly added during the bleaching process. These agents absorb UV
radiation and re-emit it in the blue region of the visible spectrum,
enhancing the perceived whiteness of the fabric.</p>
<p>Dyed cotton exhibits highly variable fluorescence depending on the
dye used. Many dyes suppress or quench fluorescence, while certain
fluorescent dyes, such as those based on rhodamine or fluorescein, can
produce vivid colors under UV illumination.</p>
<p>Cotton treated with optical brighteners through laundry detergents
also displays a strong bluish-white fluorescence, similar to that seen
in commercially bleached fabrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, a white cotton fiber typically appears strongly fluorescent
under a UV microscope, but the intensity depends on how the fiber was
processed.</p>
<p>In most modern white cotton fabrics, optical brightening agents
(OBAs) are applied during bleaching or finishing. These compounds absorb
ultraviolet radiation (usually in the 340-380 nm range) and re-emit blue
light (around 420-450 nm). Under a UV microscope, such fibers appear
with a bright blue-white fluorescence, often much more intense than that
of untreated natural fibers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image below shows a fiber that McCairn supposedly found in the
3-year-old's blood. The fiber is fluorescent under UV light even without
ThT staining, so I don't know if the fiber might for example be a fiber
of cotton that was dyed white:

<hr />
<p>When McCairn asks his followers to send samples of blood to him on a
slide in the mail, he supposedly finds fibrin clots with a diameter of
about 10-30 µm in a large fraction of the samples. So if the density of
clots per ml in his samples is representative of the overall density of
the clots per ml in the bloodstream, then are there thousands of clots
circulating in the bloodstream indefinitely, so that once the clots
reach the arterial capillaries, they pass through the capillary bed to
the veins, go back to the heart, and go back to arteries again? And if
the clots are somehow induced by vaccination, then how do they remain in
circulation even years after vaccination?</p>
<p>ChatGPT said that a clot with a diameter of 20 µm wouldn't pass
through the capillaries, which have a diameter of only about 5-10 µm:
[<a href=https://chatgpt.com/share/68bec722-9864-8000-a1c8-d1a5206f4923>https://<wbr>chatgpt.<wbr>com/<wbr>share/<wbr>68bec722-<wbr>9864-<wbr>8000-<wbr>a1c8-<wbr>d1a5206f4923</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No - a fibrin clot of the size you described (<strong>20 µm in
diameter × 1 mm in length</strong>) could not <span
class="quote">"loop"</span> repeatedly through the circulation. Here's
why:</p>
<p><strong>1. Size relative to vessels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capillaries</strong>: ~5-10 µm in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Your clot</strong>: 20 µm in diameter, twice as wide as the
largest capillaries.</li>
<li>Red blood cells deform to pass; fibrin clots cannot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, such a structure <strong>cannot traverse
capillaries</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Artery-to-vein transfer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For blood to move from the arterial side to the venous side, it must
pass through the <strong>capillary bed</strong>.</li>
<li>Since the clot is wider than capillaries, it would become
<strong>trapped at the first capillary network it
encounters</strong>.</li>
<li>It would not emerge on the venous side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Circulatory "loops"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only cells and small deformable particles (RBCs, WBCs, platelets)
can continuously recirculate.</li>
<li>Solid emboli (clots, cholesterol crystals, etc.) either:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lodge in a vessel</strong> (causing occlusion), or</li>
<li><strong>Fragment into smaller pieces</strong> until they are small
enough to pass further downstream.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The capillaries at the tip of a finger have a diameter of about 5-10
µm, so I was wondering if they wouldn't be too narrow for McCairn's
fibers to pass through in order for the fibers to end up in a finger
prick sample:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1965068669672997217>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1965068669672997217</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>McCairn instructs his followers to do the finger prick samples using
a small instrument that is known as a lancet, which creates a puncture
in the fingertip. However actually the lancet might reach deep enough to
penetrate the arterioles and not only the capillaries, because ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capillaries in the fingertip are far smaller than a 20 µm clot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical capillary lumen diameter:</strong> ~5-10 µm, often
just wide enough for a single red blood cell (≈7-8 µm) to deform and
pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Precapillary arterioles / postcapillary venules:</strong>
somewhat larger (≈10-30 µm), but true capillaries in the papillary
dermis are in the 5-8 µm range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>20 µm fibrin clot would not be able to traverse
capillaries</strong>; it is roughly 3-4× larger than the lumen.</li>
<li>However, if such a microclot were already present in a
<strong>postcapillary venule or small arteriole</strong> in the dermal
plexus (where diameters can be &gt;20 µm), it could potentially be
carried into the superficial circulation and then extravasated through a
lancet puncture.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said that the arterioles start at a depth of about 0.3-0.6 mm
beneath the surface of the fingertips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fingertip, the vascular network is stratified. Based on
microanatomical and histological studies of digital pulp and nail-bed
skin:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capillary loops</strong>: extend into dermal papillae
immediately beneath the epidermis, beginning at <strong>~50-150 µm below
the skin surface</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Superficial dermal plexus</strong>: composed of arterioles
and venules, located in the upper dermis at a depth of roughly
<strong>0.3-0.6 mm</strong> beneath the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper dermal/subpapillary arterioles</strong> (arising from
the deep plexus): usually found at <strong>~1-2 mm depth</strong> at the
dermal-subcutaneous junction.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>arterioles that feed the capillary loops near the
fingertip start around 0.3-0.6 mm beneath the epidermis</strong>, while
larger supply arterioles run deeper, closer to 1-2 mm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a standard finger prick lancet typically reaches a depth of about
1.5-2.0 mm. So I guess feasibly a blood clot might get stuck in
arterioles because it can't pass through the arterial capillaries, and
then it might get released if you do a finger prick that reaches the
arterioles. So it wouldn't necessarily be anomalous if a clot is too big
to pass through the capillaries, if in fact the clot was not circulating
freely in blood, but it was stuck before the arterial capillaries in the
fingertip.</p>
<p>But regardless, I consider it unlikely that the fibers McCairn finds
in blood samples are blood clots, and so far McCairn has not even been
able to show that his fibers are made of fibrin.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn now also posted the image below, and he wrote: <span
class="quote">"I've found a more clear image of the linear clot, but
it's at a lower 4000X, the 5000x are all noisy. The reason for looking
at high mag is to dispel the notion that it's cotton which shows
pronounced linear striations. It's clear in this sample that the surface
is dimpled, non-striated, and has nodules consistent with other
amyloidogenic clots."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>The 4000x image shows a part near the end of the fiber towards the
right side of the image (which was demonstrated by a second image in
McCairn's tweet, but I didn't manage to save the second image before his
post was marked as age-restricted content, and I don't have a phone so
I'm not able to verify my age).</p>
<p>The new image shows a part close to the end that is about 9 µm wide,
but the earlier 200x image showed a part closer to the middle that was
about 13 µm wide.</p>
<p>ChatGPT said: <span class="quote">"Cotton fibers from Gossypium
appear flattened and twisted along their length because the central
lumen collapses as the fiber matures and dries, giving the middle
portion a ribbon-like, C-shaped cross-section. However, at the fiber
ends, the lumen is less collapsed and the structure remains more
rounded, so the ends typically appear smoother and more cylindrical
under the microscope."</span></p>
<p>The earlier 200x image clearly showed a more flat and twisted shape:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-3year-200x.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>I told McCairn that the image above was so blurry that subtle
striations might be hard to see. But then McCairn pointed out that the
fiber also had <span class="quote">"protruding nodule/nucleation
sites"</span>, which I think meant the small ball-like specks that were
attached to the fiber:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x-2.jpg width=595>
</div>
<p>Then I posted a microscope image of fibers in dust with specks
attached to them, and I asked McCairn if his <span
class="quote">"nodules"</span> or <span class="quote">"nulecation
sites"</span> were just specks of dust. But he said it was unlikely
because his fiber had been soaked in buffer and dye:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x-3.jpg width=595>
</div>
<p>I pointed out it would be easy to do an experiment where you took a
sample of dust that contained fibers with specks attached, you soaked
the sample in buffer and ThT, and checked if the specks remained adhered
to the fibers. And I posted this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, dust specks could remain adhered to a microscopic fiber even if
the fiber has been soaked in buffer and ThT, but the likelihood depends
on several factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Nature of the Fiber Surface</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the fiber is hydrophilic (e.g., cellulose or proteinaceous
material), buffer and ThT will wet it well, which can loosen loosely
attached dust particles.</li>
<li>If it is hydrophobic (e.g., certain synthetic polymers), surface
tension effects may cause dust specks to stay trapped.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dust Particle Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dust is heterogeneous: it can include inorganic particles, organic
matter, fibers, salts, and lipids. Some of these bind electrostatically
or hydrophobically to surfaces and are not easily washed off.</li>
<li>Small particles (&lt;1 µm) may adhere strongly through van der Waals
forces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Buffer and ThT Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aqueous buffer itself usually does not solubilize dust (unless the
dust contains salts).</li>
<li>Thioflavin T (ThT) is a small, charged, aromatic dye. At the
concentrations typically used, it does not act as a detergent, so it
won't remove particles strongly bound to the fiber.</li>
<li>ThT may even interact with hydrophobic dust or fibrous debris,
leading to retention rather than removal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanical Handling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Passive soaking is often insufficient to dislodge strongly adhered
dust.</li>
<li>Agitation, sonication, or filtration would be more effective.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn told me I should get my own lab equipment to do the
experiment. And in fact I have thought of buying some basic equipment so
I could do experiments like this myself. But McCairn should be
interested in performing the experiment himself, in case he relies on
the specks attached to his fiber as evidence that the fiber is not made
of cotton.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn did a 3-minute video where he instructed his followers on how
to take a sample of blood from their finger on a glass slide. At the end
of the video, he smears the droplets of blood so that they're spread out
over the glass, but the blood is left exposed to open air, and he says:
<span class="quote">"Let these dry overnight in a dust-free
environment."</span>
[<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://<wbr>synapteklabs.<wbr>com/<wbr>protocol-<wbr>on-<wbr>sending-<wbr>blood-<wbr>samples-<wbr>2/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairndry.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>How many of his followers actually had a perfectly dust-free
environment at their home? He didn't instruct his followers to put any
cover over the slides so dust wouldn't fall on the slides. And he didn't
instruct his followers to check afterwards that zero fibers of dust had
landed on the droplet of blood while it was drying.</p>

<p>In May 2025 the Died Suddenly crew announced that they were raising

<p>One of the people featured in the film was Maria Zeee, but a few
weeks earlier, McCairn went on Maria Zeee's show together with Richard
Hirschman, who was the main star of the original Died Suddenly film:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-zeeemccairn.webp width=333>
</div>
<p>Several other people in the Nano Sapiens film are also connected to
the story about the clots:
[<a href=https://ds2nano.com>https://<wbr>ds2nano.<wbr>com</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ana Maria Mihalcea:</strong> When she looked at
Hirschman's coffee ground clots under a microscope, and she presented a
video of blinking lights as evidence that the clots contained quantum
dot micro robots, Hirschman told her: <span class="quote">"You got some
pretty daggum solid proof behind you when you're showing the actual
images, you're showing the blinking lights"</span>.

When she said she saw Morgellons filaments in Hirschman's clots,
Hirschman told her: <span class="quote">"I had a live blood analysis of
my own blood, and my blood had some of those filaments in it
too."</span> She also did a video where she showed microscope images of
embalmed blood she received from Hirschman, which she said contained
Morgellons filaments, self-creating spheres, and blinking lights that
constructed ribbons out of hydrogel. But I haven't seen Hirschman
disavow Mihalcea's claims anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>La Quinta Columna:</strong> I have found no reference to
a new type of white fibrous clots before January 2022 when Jane Ruby
first broke the news about the clots. But Jane Ruby also says that she
broke La Quinta Columna's story about graphene oxide.
[<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>RealDrJaneRuby/<wbr>status/<wbr>1619624953036558338</a>]
In 2021 before the story about the new type of white clots had been
rolled out, La Quinta Columna were saying that vaccinated women had
black period blood with black clots (even though for some reason the
story about the black clots was later forgotten, but the story about the
white clots became a big hit).

<li><p><strong>Youngmi Lee and Daniel Broudy:</strong> Their paper about
nanotechnology in COVID vaccines was published by the journal IJVTPR.
IJVTPR has also published the only scientific paper about calamari clots
I have found, which was coauthored by Daniel Santiago and John Oller,
who are both members of the editorial board of IJVTPR.

Santiago wrote a Substack post about the clots where he promoted
McCairn's research.

In 2024, IJVTPR published a paper which said there was nanotechnology in
COVID vaccines because the vaccines contained a high level of
lanthanides, and later a response to criticism of the paper was
published by six editors of IJVTPR, who included Santiago, Oller, and
Daniel Broudy. They wrote that the likelihood that lanthanides <span
class="quote">"are not involved in self-assembling entities in the
fluids and in the unnatural clots in many recipients is zero"</span>.

In 2024 Daniel Broudy's nanotechnology paper was discussed by Matt
Shelton and Philip McMillan, who both presented the paper in a favorable
light. Shelton said that he knows Broudy, and that Broudy is <span
class="quote">"a goldmine on the way that language is used to

Matt Shelton and Gerry Brady were both credited in An Unholy Triad, but
they were also members of the IIRT group, whose Brighteon channel
consists of interviews of the group's members by Daniel Broudy. Philip
McMillan did a video where he discussed Greg's fake ORFs in relation to
Daniel Santiago's <span class="quote">"quantum codon energetics"</span>
theory, but McMillan has also done multiple videos about McCairn's
research of the clots, and McCairn and Rixey were speakers in McMillan's
online conference.</p></li>

NZDSOS also published photos of calamari clots that were supposedly
removed from a living person, and NZDSOS published a testimony by an
anonymous mortician who claimed to have seen calamari clots.

fighting against the clots, one of the people on his list was David
Nixon, who provided an audio file to Santiago that was attached to the
post.

<li><p><strong>Steven Quay:</strong> Greg Harrison did a video where he
claimed that Quay's paper explained why the spike protein induced the
formation of calamari clots.

By looking at the supplementary data in another paper, Quay found three
20 aa segments that overlapped with Pradhan's first three so-called HIV
inserts, and that had a high fibrinogen binding affinity. But Quay
presented the results in a misleading way, and he failed to show that
more than half of the NTD was covered by 20 aa segments that had the
same or higher fibrinogen binding affinity as the three segments he
highlighted, which were all in the NTD.

And Pradhan's matches to the so-called inserts have extremely high
E-values, which means that they are almost certainly due to chance, and
there's similarly close matches to HIV throughout the genome of
SARS-CoV-2, and not only at the spots that resemble inserts in Pradhan's
alignment.</p></li>

<p>Accounts related to TWC seem to be artificially amplified by bots on

A tweet from 2021 said: <span class="quote">"I was suffering with an

A case study from 2011 described the case of a man who had earlier
thought he was poisoned by the Japanese mafia, but then he learned about
Morgellons disease from the internet, so he started to think he had
Morgellons instead, and he bought ivermectin in bulk from an online
veterinary supplier, so he ended up developing ivermectin toxicity.

<p>In 2024 Hulscher and McCullough coauthored a paper with Raphael
Stricker, who is possibly the main person responsible for popularizing
the Morgellons disease hoax. Stricker also coauthored a paper in 2021
with McCullough and Harvey Risch, who are both members of the <span

<p>The term Morgellons disease was coined by Mary Leitao. The earliest
paper about Morgellons disease that is structured like a scholarly paper
is probably a paper published in 2006 that was coauthored by Virginia
Savely, Mary Leitao, and Raphael Stricker.
[<a href=https://www.morgellons-disease.org/reading/AJCD%202006%20Savely.pdf>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>morgellons-<wbr>disease.<wbr>org/<wbr>reading/<wbr>AJCD%<wbr>202006%<wbr>20Savely.<wbr>pdf</a>]
Leitao's website featured these photos of Morgellons filaments that she
supposedly found in the blood of her 3-year-old son, which are
reminiscent of the mysterious fiber that McCairn found in the blood of
the 3-year-old boy:

<p>In 2019 the California Medical Board issued a complaint against
Stricker because he prescribed ivermectin as a treatment for Morgellons
disease without obtaining informed consent.
[<a href=https://lymescience.org/rogues/Raphael-Stricker/Raphael-Stricker-accusation-2019.pdf>https://<wbr>lymescience.<wbr>org/<wbr>rogues/<wbr>Raphael-<wbr>Stricker/<wbr>Raphael-<wbr>Stricker-<wbr>accusation-<wbr>2019.<wbr>pdf</a>]
Stricker was kicked out of academia in 1990 because he falsified data in
an AIDS study, and afterwards he worked as an associate director of a
penis enlargement clinic.

<p>In a video that Ana Mihalcea did with Hirschman, she said that
calamari clots are <span class="quote">"made from these filaments that
Clifford Carnicom calls cross-domain bacteria or Morgellons
filaments"</span>, and she showed these images of Morgellons filaments
that she found in Hirschman's clots:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-mihalceafilaments.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Then Hirschman told Mihalcea <span class="quote">"I had a live blood
analysis of my own blood and my blood had some of those filaments in it
too"</span> (even though it's not clear if by the filaments he meant
Morgellons filaments or some other type of filaments). [55:26] As
evidence that Hirschman's clots contained quantum dot microrobots,
Mihalcea showed a microscope video of blinking lights, but Hirschman
told her <span class="quote">"you got some pretty daggum solid proof
behind you, when you're showing the actual images, you're showing the
blinking lights"</span>. [1:00:57]</p>
<p>The only scientific paper about calamari clots I have found was
published in the journal IJVTPR (if I employ a very loose definition of
a scientific paper that includes pseudo-scientific papers masquerading
as scientific papers). One of the people on the editorial board of the
journal is Shimon Yanowitz.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>about/<wbr>editorialTeam</a>]
Yanowitz said that the photo below showed a ribbon that he found in his
blood. He said the ribbon may have come from either chemtrails or from
shedding by vaccinated people. He said that the ribbon was possibly a
Morgellons filament, and that it looked very mean and it made red blood
cells nervous. Shimon's ribbon was about 2 to 3 red blood cells wide,
which is similar to the diameter of the fibers that McCairn says are
fibrin microclots, and the fibers that Mihalcea says are hydrogel
filaments:

<p>The term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was first
introduced in September 2021 in Arne Burkhardt's pathology conference.
[<a href=turbo.html>turbo.<wbr>html</a>] People in the conference said that
vaccines contained mini robots, graphene oxide, objects that looked like
SIM cards, and a parasite called <em>Treponasoma cruzi</em>. One person
in the conference showed this microscope image of vaccinated blood,
which she said showed synthetic fibers that may have consisted of
graphene, but another person suggested the fibers were Morgellons
filaments:

<p>In reality the fibers in the image above have several characteristics
of cotton, because they are about 2 to 3 blood cells wide, they have a
flat body with a cupped C-like shape, and they have the kind of
lengthwise twists that are called convolutions in fibers of cotton.</p>
<p>One of the people in McCairn's circle is Johanna Deinert, who worked
together with Arne Burkhardt, and I believe she even helped run his
website, which is rather suspicious considering how Burkhardt appears to
have been a Quinta Columna type plant in alt media.</p>

<p>In 2021 Finnegan wrote an article about Morgellons disease, where he
claimed that he had witnessed Morgellons disease in his extended family
members, he characterized the Carnicom Institute as a credible source,
and he suggested that the presence of microplastics in rain might mean
that Morgellons is spread through chemtrails. He wrote that Morgellons
disease was the result of <span class="quote">"adverse events in
nanotechnological failure"</span>, and he compared Morgellons filaments
to nanowires produced by genetically modified viruses (even though the
fibers that are said to be Morgellons filaments are visible with an
optical microscope, but nanowires are not).

<p>Finnegan is a regular guest on the channel of the son of a high-level
FBI agent, who also recorded an audio narration of Finnegan's book, and
who appears to be Finnegan's biggest advocate in alt media. The son of
the FBI agent launched his YouTube channel together with a Jew who said
that he had homies at French Mossad, and that he worked with Dutch
intelligence in New York:

<p>Before Finnegan emerged on the scene, the primary proponent of his
theory that Lyme disease was created by Erich Traub was John Loftus, who
wrote the foreword for Finnegan's book, and who provided Project
Paperclip files to Finnegan that were used as source material in the
book. Finnegan wrote that Loftus <span class="quote">"was the first to
expose the Lyme disease connection to biological warfare, in
1982"</span>.

<p>Loftus is a former military intelligence officer, Nazi hunter, and
president of the Florida Holocaust Museum.

He appeared as a regular commentator on Fox News, and the CBS show 60
Minutes won an Emmy Award for an episode where Loftus presented his
story about secret Belarusian Nazis. Loftus claims that he is an Irish
Catholic, but he even wrote a column called <span
class="quote">"Spyview"</span> for a Haredi Jewish magazine called Ami,
so I don't know if he is a crypto-Jew or just a particularly hardcore
shabbos goy. An old bio of Loftus said: <span class="quote">"As a young
U.S. Army officer, John Loftus helped train Israelis on a covert
operation that turned the tide of battle in the 1973 Yom Kippur
War."</span>

Vital Zayka, a fellow of the Center for Jewish History in New York City,
accused Loftus of
falsification.[<a href=http://nn.by/?c=ar&i=26162>7</a>] The Israeli
historian and Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff described the book as
controversial and referred to Charles R. Allen Jr.'s review in Jewish
Currents, in which Allen joined the active criticism of Loftus and named
him a fraud and a liar.[8]"</span>

<p>Loftus said that the publisher of his book <span class="quote">"The
Belarus Secret"</span> was a former high-level CIA agent who had a Q
clearance, and who taught him about the history of biowarfare.
[<a href=https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ly6eXrVXG3ORiKtN2mHjY>https://<wbr>open.<wbr>spotify.<wbr>com/<wbr>episode/<wbr>1<wbr>l<wbr>y<wbr>6<wbr>e<wbr>X<wbr>r<wbr>V<wbr>X<wbr>G<wbr>3<wbr>O<wbr>R<wbr>i<wbr>K<wbr>t<wbr>N<wbr>2<wbr>m<wbr>H<wbr>j<wbr>Y<wbr></a>,
2:40] So if you trace back the mentorship chain, Finnegan was taught
about the history of biowarfare by a former military intelligence agent,
who says he was taught about the history of biowarfare by a former CIA
agent.</p>
<p>Loftus coauthored two of his three best-known books with the Jew Mark
Aarons, whose father was the head of the Communist Party of Australia
and a grandson of two founding members of the party. Aarons worked at
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which aired two documentaries
about Nazis he did with Loftus. For some reason, the copyright holder of
the book <span class="quote">"The Secret War Against the Jews"</span> is
listed as Aarons and not Loftus. The book was supposedly an <span
class="quote">"oral history"</span> of anti-Jewish operations conducted
by intelligence agencies, which was based on interviews that Loftus and
Aarons conducted with over 500 former intelligence officers. Loftus and
Aarons wrote: <span class="quote">"Most of the hundreds of intelligence
officers we interviewed over the last decade were trained to regard
Jews, and hence Israel, as hostile targets."</span> One of the anonymous
spies is supposed to have said: <span class="quote">"In public, Israel
is our ally. What the public doesn't know is that all Western nations
have covert policies to side with the Arabs. It keeps the intelligence
community busy. Screwing Jews is what I did for a living."</span></p>
<p>Loftus used to organize an annual conference in DC called The
Intelligence Summit, whose advisory council included two former heads of
the CIA and senior officials of the Mossad.

Aquino's commanding officer at the 7th PSYOP Group, and who coauthored
the article <span class="quote">"From PSYOP to Mindwar"</span> with
Aquino:

<p>A financial sponsor of the conference was the Israeli gangster
Michael Cherney, who organized a similar conference in Israel called the
Jerusalem Summit. Cherney has been denied a visa to the United States
since 1999 because of his involvement with the Russian Jewish mafia. In
1999 the Intepol issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney
for money laundering and organized crime.

Cherney's protege Oleg Deripaska was at one point the called the richest
man in Russia.</p>
<p>Joel van der Reijden wrote this about Finnegan's mentor: <span
class="quote">"Other very obvious neocons - hardcore Zionists, in fact -
that have appeared on Coast to Coast AM are Robert Spencer and John
Loftus. Spencer runs the anti-Islamic outfit Jihad Watch and sits on the
advisory board of the Intelligence Summit. [...] Loftus is tied to the
highest levels of Israeli and Zionist political and intelligence
circles. Former CIA directors James Woolsey and John Deutch sat on the
board of his Intelligence Summit until 2006, when very obvious Russian
mafia ties to the Summit's long-term financier, Russian Zionist oligarch
Michael Cherney, were made public. Woolsey and Deutch should have known
about these ties, because since the late 1990s Cherney has been
repeatedly and convincingly linked to the powerful Russian-Zionist
Solntsevskaya mafia and its allies. These allies also include the
primary Rothschild partner in Russia, Oleg Deripaska, as well as the
Israeli state, which prevented a KGB/FSB-ran assassination against
Cherney in 1995. In 2003 Cherney also founded the Jerusalem Summit,
which sponsored at least two small meetings between Israeli officials
and American neocons. At the first meeting in 2003 Richard Perle and
Coast to Coast's Frank Gaffney were present, along with Ehud Olmert and
Benyamin Netanyahu. That's two visitors of Coast to Coast AM with clear
ties to Michael Cherney: John Loftus and Frank Gaffney. Basically,
inviting either of these two men is the same as giving voice to
propaganda of the CIA, MI6, Mossad, Russian-Zionist oligarchs and the
Russian-Zionist Solntsevskaya mafia all at once."</span>

<p>In the book <span class="quote">"The Secret War Against the
Jews"</span>, Loftus and Aarons included a chapter about Robert Maxwell,
where they praised Maxwell's various exploits and admired his clever
<span class="quote">"con artistry"</span>. They wrote that Maxwell saved
Israel from defeat in 1948 because he supplied Israel with arms from
Czechoslovakia, and that <span class="quote">"this one act alone made
Robert Maxwell a great man, one whose memory will be forever revered as
one of Israel's founding heroes."</span>

In 2010 Trine Day republished Loftus's book <span class="quote">"The

didn't have anything critical to say about Loftus's story even though it
was obviously fake. In 2025 Trine Day published an autobiography of
Loftus titled <span class="quote">"My Clients were Spies"</span>.

Bruce de Torres worked as a marketing director at Trine Day, and he had
a radio show on TNT Radio. Daniel Estulin claims to be a former KGB
agent, and he received a doctorate degree in <span
class="quote">"conceptual intelligence"</span> from Venezuela. Estulin
says that the world is run by the Venetian black nobility or <span

Naftali Estulin is a rabbi who runs a synagogue and a Chabad House in
Hollywood, and who manages the Chabad Russian Immigrant Program in
Hollywood.

In 2023 TNT Radio launched a news site called The Intelligencer, which
is still in operation. The editorial board of The Intelligencer includes
Lee Stranahan, who was a protege of Andrew Breitbart and Steve Bannon,
who introduced George Webb to Jason Goodman, and who said that he
introduced Guccifer 2.0 to Roger Stone. Another member of the board is
Roger Stone's lawyer Tyler Nixon. And another member ran an organization
called Serbs for Trump, and another member is an advisor to the head of

<p>John Loftus was a frequent guest on the radio show of Dave Emory, who
is a leftist conspiracy theorist who finds Nazis hiding under every
rock.
[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aspitfirelist.com+loftus>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=site%<wbr>3Aspitfirelist.<wbr>com+<wbr>loftus</a>]
In one of his radio shows, Dave Emory said that the reason why all the
crooks appear to be Jews is because they're actually Nazis with fake
papers: <span class="quote">"But the main reason according to John
Loftus that the German government dragged its feet so dutifully in
releasing documents about the Third Reich - there was a large
documentation center in Berlin controlled by the German government, it
was the single largest repository of information about the Third Reich,
they only released it to journalists and historians a couple of years
ago, more than 60 years after the end World War II - and the main reason
for that according to John Loftus is that - as the Third Reich
operatives were preparing for their post-war underground careers, a
massive forging program was underway within the concentration camps
using forgers - who were basically a captive workforce - to create very
elaborate paper trails documenting many of these post-war Third Reich
operatives as Jews. So that in addition to Bormann Jews <em>per se</em>,
there is also a substantive body of underground Reich slash Bormann
capital network operatives, who are basically nominally Jews, but are in
fact good loyal Nazis who have been given Jewish documentation. Again,
what a perfect cover for an underground operative of any kind, then - to
make oneself out to be the opposite of what one really is. So in
addition to the concept of Bormann Jews <em>per se</em>, bear in mind
that there was according to John Loftus a massive program to create a
Jewish cover for post-war operatives, and then rather like the financial
crisis, it can be blamed on - your negative things can be blamed on,
quote, <span class="quote">'the Jews'</span>."</span>

16:53] Emory's bible on post-war Nazis was a book about Martin Bormann
by Paul Manning, who worked as a war correspondent for CBS before he
became a conspiracy author. But Loftus has also worked as a consultant
for CBS, and he has appeared as a regular commentator on Fox News, and
his coauthor worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>Dave Emory called himself a <span class="quote">"Brussel
sprout"</span>, because he was a disciple of the leftist conspiracy
theorist Mae Brussell. Brussel's father was Rabbi Edgar Magnin, who was
a spiritual leader of Hollywood Jews, who referred to himself as a <span
class="quote">"Jewmanist"</span>, and who delivered the prayer at
Nixon's inauguration. In 1936 he was calling for an <span

Emory also did a radio show where he speculated that HIV was a Nazi
bioweapon, and that Aryans had a genetic mutation that made them immune
to AIDS.

<p>One of the main topics Dave Emory discussed on his radio show was how
HIV was a bioweapon, and he also promoted the work of Len Horowitz and
Alan Cantwell, who both said that HIV was a bioweapon created by the
Americans.

Alan Cantwell's protege Saint Nick is part of McCairn's circle, and Nick
has archived old videos by Horowitz and Cantwell on McCairn's PeerTube
site.
[<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/c/hiv_lab_origin/videos>https://<wbr>t.<wbr>wtyl.<wbr>live/<wbr>c/<wbr>hiv_<wbr>lab_<wbr>origin/<wbr>videos</a>]
Nick frequently also promotes Adam Finnegan, and he hosted a video panel
that featured Finnegan and McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey.</p>
<p>Nick claims that HIV is a recombinant virus that includes components
of the visna virus. Variations of his visna recombination theory had
earlier been presented by John Seale, Robert Strecker, Jakob Segal, and
Alan Cantwell. Nick has been unable to answer me which parts of the
genome of HIV come from visna, and I have shown him plots which
demonstrate that no part of the genome of HIV is closer to visna than to
SIV.

Nick uses the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> to refer to
genomic recombination of viruses, so as evidence for his recombination
hypothesis, he keeps presenting a paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, even though the paper is about visna-induced syncytium
formation of host cells, where the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> refers to host cells merging together into
a cell with multiple nuclei, and not to recombination of two different
species of viruses.

After I had called him out many times for presenting the paper as
evidence for his hypothesis, but he still kept referring to the paper, I
said that he seems to be deliberately producing disinformation, because
at that point he should've known himself that the paper had nothing to
do with his hypothesis, but he blocked me in response. One time Nick
said that the area of <span class="quote">"recombinant DNA"</span> that
created HIV is <span class="quote">"referred to as fusogenics, or fusion
products"</span>, even though both terms refer to the fusion of the HIV
envelope protein with the host cell, which has nothing to do with the
genomic recombination of two species of viruses.

<p>The Russian branch of the Knights of Malta was transplanted into the
United States in the late 1800s. One of the knights was the UFO
disinformationist Colonel Philip J. Corso, another knight was the Chief
of Research and Analysis at the CIA, and another knight served as the
Imperial Director of the Klan Bureau of Investigation, which was the
counterintelligence unit of the KKK.

<p>Horowitz claimed that HIV was created by Robert Gallo's group at the
National Cancer Institute, but that the NCI took over Fort Detrick. His
theory is reminiscent of the KGB's disinformation campaign about how HIV
was created at Fort Detrick. [<a href=hiv.html>hiv.<wbr>html</a>] The
campaign was kicked off in 1985 by an article published in the Soviet
journal Literaturnaya Gazeta. The author of the article later worked as
a foreign correspondent for Literaturnaya Gazeta, and he described his
role as a foreign correspondent as something between a diplomat and an
intelligence officer.
[<a href=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич>https://<wbr>ru.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Запевалов%<wbr>2c_<wbr>Валентин_<wbr>Васильевич</a>]
He said that about 90% of the staff of the journal were Jews.

The former Soviet counterintelligence agent Oleg Kalugin said that
Literaturnaya Gazeta was <span class="quote">"our prime conduit in the
Soviet press for propaganda and disinformation"</span>.

The Soviet story about HIV was promoted by the DC-based magazine
CovertAction Information Bulletin, whose figurehead was the former CIA
agent Philip Agee, who communicated with the KGB through the London
correspondent of Literaturnaya Gazeta, and who according to Vasilyy
Mitrokhin worked as a KGB agent under the codename PONT.

Out of 8 people who were listed as founders of CAIB, 3 were former CIA
agents, at least 4 of the remaining 5 people were Jews, and the 5th
person I'm not sure of was married to one of the Jews.

<p>In 1992, the former Stasi disinformation officer Günter Bohnsack
admitted that the story that HIV was created at Fort Detrick was an
active measure initiated by Moscow, but the three people he credited for
popularizing the story were Jakob Segal, Stephan Heym, and Johannes
Mario Simmel, who were all Jews. The main star of the campaign was the
communist Jew Jakob Segal, who had previously supplied the Stasi with
intelligence on western nuclear research, and who once suggested his
supervising officer at the Stasi to stage a car accident to kill a
scientist. Segal claimed that HIV was a genomic recombinant of the
STLV-I and visna viruses, even though he was a hardcore Lysenkoist who
had earlier continued to support Lysenko's view that genes did not exist
even after Lysenko himself had abandoned it. Segal's books were
published by the publishing house of the Marxist-Leninist Party of
Germany. The director of the publishing house coauthored a book with
Segal, and he went on a speaking tour in Africa promoting Segal's theory
together with the Communist Party of South Africa. Segal was interviewed
in the West German press by the Jewish journalist Stefan Heym, who was a
close friend of Segal. Heym was earlier the editor-in-chief of the
German-language newspaper of Communist Party USA. He served in the US
Army's psychological warfare unit called the Ritchie Boys, which was led
by the Jew Hans Habe, who established numerous newspapers in Germany
after the war after the German press was dismantled. Heym was an editor
of one of the newspapers, which was largely staffed by Jews who had
served in the psychological warfare division of the US Army. Heym wrote
the script for a propaganda radio play which included the earliest
reference of any kind I have found of Josef Mengele being an evil doctor
at Auschwitz. The Stasi disinformation officer Bohnsack also said that
the Stasi supplied material about HIV to the Jewish fiction writer
Johannes Mario Simmel, who wrote a popular novel about the theory that
HIV was created at Fort Detrick. [<a href=hiv.html>hiv.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>Jakob Segal's theory that HIV was created at Fort Detrick is
reminiscent of the theory that SARS-CoV-2 was created at Fort Detrick,
whose main proponent was George Webb. In February 2020, the CBS aired a
report about Webb's theory on the program 60 Minutes, but similarly in
1987, the CBS aired a report about Segal's theory by the 60 Minutes host
Dan Rather. Segal said that HIV was a hybrid of the HTLV-1 and visna
viruses, but Webb also said that SARS-CoV-2 was a hybrid of three
viruses. Segal was registered as a Stasi informant, but according to
Trish the Dish who used to do videos with Webb, Webb had acquired a
level 3 certification at the Department of Homeland Security (and DHS
hired Markus Wolf who was the head of the HV A department of Stasi which
oversaw Segal's operation, and the name of DHS is reminiscent of Stasi
which is short for <span class="quote">"state security"</span> in
German). [<a href=yt.html#George_Webb>yt.<wbr>html#<wbr>George_<wbr>Webb</a>]</p>
<p>The theory that SARS-CoV-2 was created in Fort Detrick was also
promoted by Mark Kulacz, who did his alt media debut on a channel that
was launched by the son of a high-level FBI agent together with George
Webb.
[<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicLive/<wbr>status/<wbr>1742404612819210380</a>]
After Kulacz launched his own YouTube channel, the first guest on the
channel was the son of the FBI agent.

Lyme disease was one of the main topics Kulacz discussed on his YouTube
channel before COVID.</p>
<p>George Webb started promoting Finnegan's book soon after the book was
published.

Webb said he was part of a network associated with Russia Today where he
transfered information on thumb drives across countries.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDAZ3pF9jIw>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=CDAZ3pF9jIw</a>]
George Webb and Jason Goodman both speak fluent Russian according to
Steve Outtrim, and Webb was introduced to Goodman by Lee Stranahan who
is registered as a Russian foreign agent.

<hr />
<p>Added later: I should probably write a dedicated article about Loftus
and Finnegan, but in the book <span class="quote">"The Secret War
Against the Jews"</span>, John Loftus and Mark Aarons wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rachel Vernon has been collecting declassified records of Soviet
research on Nazi toxins. She has compiled a frightening and formidable
amount of documentation. Although the evidence is still incomplete,
there is reason to believe that the Soviet military discovered that
ticks, fleas, and lice could be systematically infected and then
secretly dispersed throughout an enemy population. There are some
indications that the Soviets used the <span class="quote">"insect
vector"</span> on their own dissident Moslem populations.</p>
<p>According to our sources, they tried it on an American population as
well. Vernon has found some intriguing circumstantial evidence to
support this claim. In the late 1940s, the Soviet ship Elberus delivered
a load of furs and skins to the port of New York. Shortly afterward an
epidemic of an unknown disease similar to rickettsial pox broke out in
New York City. It was traced to a form of insect rarely seen in the
United States but common in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>According to our sources, the U.S. government threw a top-secret
classification over the entire episode and immediately began to study
the Soviet insect vectors on Plum Island off the coast of Connecticut.
That, the old spies say, is how Lyme disease began to spread. The
government quietly commissioned a study of the New England population,
using the unwitting Muscular Sclerosis Society as a cover. When no
indications of epidemic infections in humans or animals were found, the
whole study was quietly scrapped.</p>
<p>What the government did not know was that Lyme disease can be dormant
for several years and later may have reacted with common vaccines in a
most unfortunate manner. While the Lyme disease story cannot be
corroborated, Vernon has confirmed that a top-secret U.S. study labeled
<span class="quote">"Clandestine Attacks on Crops and Animals"</span>
once existed, but all copies have been destroyed. One of the
participants in the study, Leo Alexander, has been identified as a U.S.
intelligence expert on Nazi medical experiments on human beings. To this
day, the Department of Agriculture Research Station on Plum Island is
closed to human visitors. Still, it may all be a coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's convenient how the sources cited are <span class="quote">"old
spies say"</span> or <span class="quote">"according to our
sources"</span> or <span class="quote">"a study that once existed but
all copies have been destroyed"</span>.</p>
<p>In the book <span class="quote">"The Belarus Secret"</span>, Loftus
wrote about Lyme disease right after a paragraph where he suggested that
Israel's Arab neighbors were manufacturing Nazi nerve gas, and that
Mengele tested poison gas on Auschwitz inmates and <span
class="quote">"traded the test records to British intelligence in return
for his freedom"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an irony that one of Israel's Arab neighbors is reported to be
manufacturing Nazi nerve gas. Sarin is cheaper than atomic bombs and
almost as deadly. Wonder where the Arabs got the Nazi nerve gas formula?
A British document mentions a post-war interview with a man named <span
class="quote">"Mengele"</span> as a Nazi adjutant in charge of research
on poison gas weapons. It is almost certain that Dr. Joseph Mengele
experimented with Sarin on Auschwitz inmates and then traded the test
records to British intelligence in return for his freedom. The actual
inventor of Nazi nerve gas emigrated to the United States and died
recently in Florida.</p>
<p>Even more disturbing are the records of the Nazi germ warfare
scientists who came to America. They experimented with poison ticks
dropped from planes to spread rare diseases. I received some information
suggesting that the US tested some of these poison ticks on the Plum
Island artillery range off the coast of Connecticut during the early

the source of the Lyme disease spirochete, and that migrating waterfowl
were the vectors that carried the ticks from Plum Island all up and down
the Eastern Seaboard. Most of the germ warfare records have been
shredded, but there is a top secret US document confirming that <span

place at this time. The Lyme disease outbreak in America was monitored
secretly under the cover of a New England health study.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the book <span class="quote">"The Belarus Secret"</span> which was
later republished by Trine Day under the title <span
class="quote">"America's Nazi Secret"</span>, Loftus claimed that about
50,000 Jews were killed in a secret Belarusian Holocaust. Loftus wrote
that after he was hired by the Office of Special Investigations, which
was the DoJ's Nazi hunting division, his <span class="quote">"security
clearances were upgraded above Top Secret (Q, SI, COSMIC)"</span>, and
he wrote that at the OSI, <span class="quote">"security clearances were
raised - my own was three access levels above Top Secret - to permit
inspection of the secret records of the various intelligence
services"</span>. Loftus claimed that <span class="quote">"I was the
first person in forty years to review the classified archives of U.S.
intelligence"</span>, and that he spent almost two years browsing files
in twenty vaults buried underground, where he found the memoirs of a Jew
named Sol Schiadow, who described a secret Holocaust of Jews in
Belarus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spent weeks in underground vaults, learning the intricacies of
long-forgotten intelligence operations, and then systematically
retrieving the records from their dusty containers. It took years to
reassemble all the documents, many of which had never even been
translated. But there was one document that I could not forget: the
memoir of Solomon Schiadow, who had survived the Byelorussian holocaust.
Whenever I felt frustrated by a dead end or an uncooperative agency, I
would remember what he had written, and feel renewed determination to
keep on, sifting through the files for traces of the men who had
committed the atrocities he recorded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sol's story was described in more detail in the book <span
class="quote">"The Secret War Against the Jews"</span>, where his last
name was written as <span class="quote">"Schnadow"</span> and not <span
class="quote">"Schiadow"</span>. In the book, Loftus and Aarons wrote
that even though Sol's exploits were not recorded by history books, he
was the only survivor of a Polish horseback invasion into Nazi Germany,
and probably the first Jewish soldier to invade Nazi Germany. During his
invasion, Sol supposedly went partially bald because his hair stuck to
dried blood in his helmet (which does not seem physically plausible):
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/secretwaragainst0000loft>https://<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>details/<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>c<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>t<wbr>w<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>a<wbr>g<wbr>a<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>s<wbr>t<wbr>0<wbr>0<wbr>0<wbr>0<wbr>l<wbr>o<wbr>f<wbr>t<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three days after Germany attacked Poland with tanks and airplanes,
Shnadow's unit counterattacked on horseback. The unit actually fought
its way across the frontier and penetrated the Third Reich. Shnadow was
probably the first Jewish soldier to invade Nazi Germany. The incident
did not make it into the history books, however, because he was the only
survivor. The German army caught the little band of Polish cavalrymen in
an artillery ambush, followed by a machine gun attack. Shnadow's horse
was blown to the ground, pinning him beneath it. In seconds the battle
was over. The brave Polish cavalry surrendered. Then the German infantry
moved in to take its revenge.</p>
<p>First, the Germans shot the prisoners of war and then the Polish
wounded. Shnadow could hear the footsteps as the executioners
approached. He could only lie there helplessly and close his eyes as the
shots came closer. A German soldier looked down at him, covered from
head to toe with the blood of his horse. <span class="quote">"This one's
dead,"</span> the soldier muttered, and moved on. For seven hours
Shnadow lay still amid the corpses, waiting for the Germans to finish
their killing and leave. When darkness came, he struggled from beneath
the horse and threw off his helmet. To his amazement, all the hair on
the top of his head was stuck to the dried blood in the helmet. He was
alive, but partially bald.</p>
<p>Shnadow changed his uniform for some clothes he had stolen and snuck
back across the border into Poland, the only survivor of the first raid
on the Third Reich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Sol's hair never grew back, because a few pages later when
Loftus and Aarons described events that took place several years later
in 1945, they wrote that Sol managed to avoid capture by the Soviets
because of his baldness: <span class="quote">"The soldiers ran right
past. The Soviets were looking for a young soldier with hair, not a
balding refugee. Making him lose his hair was the only favor the Nazis
had done for him."</span></p>
<p>According to Loftus and Aarons, the main person responsible for the
Belarusian Holocaust was Stanislaw Stankievich, who developed a novel
<span class="quote">"sardine method"</span> which economically enabled
killing a double layer of Jews with one bullet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SS had asked whether Stankievich could massacre every one of the
eight thousand Jews in Borisov in a single day, without any German help.
Stankievich thought it over and said that it could be done. He threw a
wild party for his police force, to get them properly drunk for the work
that was to come.</p>
<p>The raid began at 3:00 A.M. on October 20. It was all very
systematic. The Jews were shuttled out one hundred at a time to a road
near the airport where long ditches had been dug. There they were forced
to undress and made to lie on top of each other, head to toe.
Stankievich's idea was to shoot through a double row of bodies to save
ammunition. It was his own unique contribution to the horrors of the
Holocaust. Of course, if the Jew on top was shot through the heart, the
one on the bottom was only wounded. The police were told to cover the
wounded with a thin layer of dirt and then suffocate them beneath
another double layer of bodies. It went on all day: a layer of dirt, a
double layer of bodies, another layer of dirt, and so on. Stankievich
was very proud of his system. He called it the <span
class="quote">"sardine method."</span></p>
<p>After the war the worst part of the atrocities was discovered: The
bodies of the smallest children had no wounds. Apparently, to save the
price of a bullet, Stankievich buried the babies alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Holocaust literature is full of stories of crafty Jews who
managed to escape from a gas chamber, so in similar fashion, Loftus told
that some of the Belarusian Jews managed to cleverly dig themselves out
of mass graves: <span class="quote">"The mass graves were overfilled,
and some of the victims, who had only been wounded, dug themselves
out."</span> However the clumsiness of the <span class="quote">"sardine
method"</span> appears to have inspired the invention of gas chambers:
<span class="quote">"The massacres nauseated the Germans because the
methods were considered clumsy. There were complaints back to Berlin
about wounded Jews crawling out of graves alive. [...] Eichmann's diary
noted that he was revolted by the brutal method of killing in the
Belarus region and ordered experiments with poison gas as a more <span
class="quote">'humane'</span> alternative."</span> Loftus didn't cite
any source for Eichmann's diary, because no such diary entry exists.
Loftus and Aarons also wrote: <span class="quote">"Because the gas vans
and the liquidation squad simply could not keep up with the huge numbers
of Jews to be killed, Eichmann conceived of poison gas as an
alternative. Partly in revulsion against the cruel methods of
Stankievich and his colleagues, and partly as an efficiency measure, he
brought the gas chamber into use."</span></p>
<p>Out of about 4,000 Jews in his town, Sol is supposed to have been the
only survivor, who was spared because he falsely said he was a
bricklayer, and the Nazis needed bricklayers to work at a concentration
camp. When Sol was at the concentration camp, <span class="quote">"the
young White Russian trainees tried to outdo each other in
cruelty"</span>, so that <span class="quote">"A baby was thrown in the
air and caught with a pitchfork. A young man was tied to a horse,
drenched with kerosene, and then he and the animal were burned alive.
One guard took a butcher knife and carved out human organs while the
victim was still alive."</span></p>
<p>According to Loftus and Aarons, Sol then led the escape of 125 Jews
from the concentration camp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shnadow and four others decided to plan a breakout. It was madness,
but there was no other choice. Shnadow said that if even one of them
lived to be a witness, to tell what the Nazis had done, it would be
worth it. The last 125 Jews were marked for death anyway. Under the
noses of the SS, they dug a tunnel out of the stable leading to the
fence. The blacksmith's shop made a pair of wire cutters. Time was
running out. Soon the fence would be electrified.</p>
<p>That night Shnadow led the breakout. His job was to kill the closest
guard and cut the wires. But the guard already was dead drunk, and the
heavy snowfall muffled their escape. In one of the worst blizzards of
the season, the last Jews in the camp made their escape into the night.
It was dawn before the guards realized what had happened. The Germans
thought it a poor reflection on White Russian efficiency that Jews could
escape from a school for camp guards. Stankievich ordered a massive
manhunt and captured one of the inmates. Before he was tortured to
death, he revealed who had planned the breakout. Stankievich put a price
of 10,000 marks on Shnadow's head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span class="quote">"The Belarus Secret"</span>, Loftus wrote that
Sol himself dug the tunnel: <span class="quote">"This little Jewish
barber dug a tunnel under a Nazi concentration camp and led the last
hundred Jews in a breakout. The Nazis put out a reward of 10,000 marks
on Sol's head."</span></p>
<p>Loftus and Aarons wrote that afterwards when Sol had moved to the
United States, he happened to give a copy of his memoirs to the FBI, but
the memoirs remained buried in the FBI's archives until Loftus
discovered the memoirs in 1979:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years passed, and then one day the FBI visited Shadow and showed him
a photograph of an alleged White Russian war criminal. Shadow gave the
FBI agents a copy of his memoirs, but told them he was quite sure that
the man in the photo had never been in Koldychevo. It was all rather
puzzling. Shnadow went back to work at his barbershop and thought no
more about the visit.</p>
<p>Shnadow's story was hidden for many years, until one of the authors
found a copy of his memoirs in a classified FBI file. In 1979, John
Loftus was one the first attorneys assigned to the Justice Department's
Nazi hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations. By luck of the
draw, he had been assigned to review the White Russian cases, the crimes
of men from Belarus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loftus claimed that the Belarusian Nazi collaborators were part of a
secret <span class="quote">"Belarus network"</span>. The existence of
the network was supposedly revealed by Friedrich Buchardt, who Loftus
said was an SS officer who was recruited by US military intelligence in
return for the information he provided on the network. Loftus is
supposed to have found Buchardt's manuscript about the network in the
same underground vaults where he found Sol's memoirs. But Buchardt may
have been an imaginary person, because Loftus wrote that <span
class="quote">"Army intelligence protected Buchardt so effectively that
no further trace of him has been found."</span></p>

<p>In May 2025, Kevin McCairn published a Substack post about how he
supposedly found an amyloid fibril in the blood of a 3-year-old boy. His

the story. Hulscher's post was then copied by Frank Bergman, who is the

<p>(The first image was actually a video clip, but I included a

the cells were white blood cells, even though they're actually red blood

<p>In a reply to Jesus4AllAlways, McCairn suggested that one or more of
the structures in the images were <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibrin"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1937732108119847100>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1937732108119847100</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-jesusheals.webp width=539>
</div>
<p>The structures in the first two images are about 3-4 times wider than
the red blood cells, but red blood cells have a diameter of about 6-8
µm, so the width of the structures is roughly consistent with the fibers
McCairn has found in blood samples, which have had a diameter of about
10-30 µm.</p>
<p>One of McCairn's fibers was flat like the structures in the first two
images, but his other fibers haven't looked similarly flat. But even
McCairn's flat fiber had a lengthwise fold running along the middle,
which was missing from the structures in the images by Jesus4AllAlways.
And the fibers in McCairn's microscope images haven't looked as
translucent as the structures in the first two images. And McCairn's
fibers haven't had the kind of folds of about 90 degrees as in the first
two images, where you can see different parts of the folded structure
overlapping each other.</p>
<p>So then why was McCairn ready to declare that the structures in the
images were <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin"</span>?</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2022 when Shimon Yanowitz was on Maria Zeee's show, he showed an
image of the structure below, which has similar folds as the ribbons in
the blood of Jesus4AllAlways. Yanowitz said the structure was a killer

crystalline-like edges. The object in question is highly consistent with

<strong>polyester</strong>, <strong>nylon</strong>, or another
<strong>textile-derived filament</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-supporting-this">Characteristics Supporting

<li><strong>No internal biological structure</strong> (e.g., no nuclei,
organelles, or cellular components).</li>
<li>The irregular folding and twisting are typical of how synthetic
fibers behave when dried or compressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ana Mihalcea said that similar translucent ribbons with folds were
<span class="quote">"hydrogel filaments"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hydrogelfilament.webp width=480>

<p>ChatGPT said that Mihalcea's hydrogel filaments were likely to be
synthetic fibers:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="left-image">Left Image:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The background consists of what look like <strong>red blood cells
(RBCs)</strong> - biconcave discs, tightly packed.</li>
<li>The ribbon runs diagonally and has a <strong>smooth,

properties</strong>, suggesting it is not biological tissue.</li>
<li>The ribbon's uniform thickness and reflective surface suggest it
could be a <strong>polymer fiber</strong>, perhaps from clothing or lab
materials (e.g., polyester or nylon).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="right-image">Right Image:</h3>

<li>The presence of RBCs again near the ribbon supports that this is a
<strong>foreign object in a biological sample</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The ribbon in both images is most likely a <strong>synthetic
fiber</strong> accidentally introduced into the sample - possibly from
clothing, gloves, wipes, or sample coverslips. It is <strong>not a
biological structure</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly when I asked what the ribbon in the video by
Jesus4AllAlways was, ChatGPT answered: <span class="quote">"The
structure has sharp folds and flat surfaces, consistent with plastic
sheeting or synthetic ribbon fibers, not biological tissue."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Added later: I asked McCairn if he still stuck to his claim that the
images by Jesus4AllAlways showed <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibrin"</span>, and if by <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibrin"</span> he referred to the flat ribbons with folds. He indicated
that he did refer to the flat ribbons with folds, and he said: <span
class="quote">"I would say from that image of that the ribbon like
structure is consistent with the morphology of amyloid fibrillar forms
seen in long covid and vax injured."</span>

<p>However I again uploaded Mihalcea's images of hydrogel filaments to
ChatGPT, and I asked if the folds and flat shape were consistent with a
fibrin clot. But ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No - sharp folds like the ones in your image (especially the ~90°
bend in the right-hand picture) are <strong>not characteristic of
natural fibrin clots</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrin mechanics</strong>: Natural fibrin fibers are
semi-flexible biopolymers. When bent, they curve smoothly because the
protofibril bundles resist sharp angles - you get arcs, not crisp
corners.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrin</strong>: Even when fibrin is converted into
amyloid-like β-sheet-rich forms, it becomes stiffer and more brittle,
but it still tends to fracture or kink irregularly rather than form a
neat, flat, ribbon-like corner.</li>
<li><strong>Your sample</strong>: The flat cross-section, uniform
thickness, and clean angular bend are far more consistent with synthetic
fibers (e.g., textile microfibers), which can hold a crease from
manufacturing or folding.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <strong>a true natural fibrin clot won't spontaneously
develop a paper-fold-style corner</strong> under physiological
conditions or during slide prep - unless it's being mechanically crushed
between coverslip and slide, in which case it fractures rather than
bends smoothly at 90°.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In July 2021 Philippe van Welbergen presented the microscope images
of vaccinated blood below, and he suggested that the translucent ribbon
with folds was made of graphene oxide. The ribbon is about 3-4 red blood
cells wide, so it has a similar diameter as the ribbons shown by
Jesus4AllAlways and Mihalcea:

<p>Just like McCairn, van Welbergen also suggested that the presence of
ribbons was somehow a characteristic of unhealthy vaccinated blood:</p>

<a href=#Are_fibrin_clots_human_tissue id=Are_fibrin_clots_human_tissue>Are

</h2>
<p>Kevin McCairn told me that the calamari clots are <span
class="quote">"very clearly blood vessel occlusions, composed of
amyloidogenic protein, that have the same properties as amyloidogenic
micro clots, that have been proven human tissue through genomic
testing"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1963634374760698021>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>KevinMcCairnPhD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1963634374760698021</a>]</p>
<p>However I told him: <span class="quote">"A clump of fibrin is not
tissue. If you dipped some rubber in blood and tested it genetically,
you would find human DNA from the blood, but that doesn't mean the
rubber would be human tissue. It's possible the clots have a human
origin, but I think it has not yet been proven."</span> And I showed him
this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling such clots <span class="quote">"human tissue"</span> would be
misleading. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood clot composition:</strong> A fibrin-rich clot with
little entrapped blood cells is still just a coagulum of protein
(fibrin) rather than a structured tissue. It lacks organized cells,
extracellular matrix, vasculature, or architecture typical of
tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of tissue (in biology/medicine):</strong> Tissue
is a collection of cells (of one or more types) and their extracellular
products, organized to perform a function. Examples: epithelial tissue,
muscle tissue, connective tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Clot vs. tissue:</strong> A clot is an <strong>acellular
polymer network</strong> (fibrin mesh) that sometimes traps platelets,
leukocytes, and red blood cells. While it originates from blood (a fluid
connective tissue), a fibrin clot by itself is not equivalent to <span
class="quote">"human tissue."</span></li>
<li><strong>Terminology in practice:</strong> Pathologists or
hematologists would usually describe this as <span class="quote">"fibrin
clot,"</span> <span class="quote">"fibrinous exudate,"</span> or <span
class="quote">"thrombus"</span> (if formed in vivo), but not <span
class="quote">"tissue."</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn posted an AI response which said that the clots are not human
tissue, but the clots can be still viewed as a <span
class="quote">"quasi-tissue scaffold"</span>, or the clots can be
considered to <span class="quote">"function as novel pathological
pseudo-tissue"</span>:

<p>But I told him that those were bad copes, and that he is a
quasi-scientist and he functions as a pseudo-scientist. He cannot even
tell protein apart from tissue, or a peptide apart from a protein, or a
micrometer apart from a micromolar, or a textile fiber apart from an
amyloid fibril.</p>

<p>I told McCairn I hadn't found evidence that string-like fibrin clots
with a diameter of about 10-30 µm would be circulating freely in human
blood. He responded by showing the images below from a paper where the
senior author was Resia Pretorius, and he wrote: <span

100 micrometers, as it fills the whole micrograph, from whole blood, and
stained with ThT."</span>

<p>I pointed out that the string-like segments on row B had a diameter
of only about 1 µm. They also seem to be part of a web-like structure
and not lone isolated fibers.</p>
<p>Then I asked ChatGPT to list the diameters of different types of
fibers that appear as contaminants on microscope slides. Most types of
fibers it listed have a diameter around the range of 10-50 µm, which
matches the diameter of the fibers that McCairn has found in blood
samples:</p>

<p>For example these cotton fibers are about 20 µm wide at the widest
point:

<p>The next photo supposedly shows hydrogel filaments that Mihalcea
found in the blood of a corpse embalmed by Hirschman. The filaments are
about 2-3 red blood cells wide, which is about 15-20 µm, because red
blood cells typically have a diameter of about 6-8 µm:

<p>These fibers in the blood of the son of Jesus4AllAlways are also
about 2-3 red blood cells wide:

<p>McCairn said that the fiber below was a <span
class="quote">"fibrillar form clot"</span> that he found in his own
blood. The fiber is about 3-4 red blood cells wide at the widest point.
McCairn said the scale bar was wrong and it was supposed to be 50 µm
wide, but based on the size of the red blood cells, the scale bar might
be closer to about 100 µm wide:

to Clifford Carnicom's photos of Morgellons filaments</a>
</h2>
<p>Clifford Carnicom's website has an archive of articles going back to
1999. His early articles focused on topics like chemtrails and HAARP,
but his first article about Morgellons disease is from 2006.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101224551/http:/www.carnicominstitute.org/html/articles_by_date.html>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20140101224551/<wbr>http:/<wbr>www.<wbr>carnicominstitute.<wbr>org/<wbr>html/<wbr>articles_<wbr>by_<wbr>date.<wbr>html</a>,

In the article he wrote that he had received a sample of skin from a
Morgellons patient in the mail. He showed this photo of a fiber in the
sample, which he said was not a human hair because the diameter of the
fiber was about 10-12 µm which was narrower than a human hair, and
because the fiber had an irregular twisted form:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-2.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>However Carnicom failed to mention that both the diameter and the
twisted shape were characteristic of a fiber of cotton. He also posted
these images of fibers in the sample, which look like cotton because
they have a flat cupped shape, and they have the kind of twists that are
called <span class="quote">"convolutions"</span> in cotton:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-3.webp width=400><img src=i/clot-carnicom-4.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>In Carnicom's second post about Morgellons disease, he wrote about a
sample he is supposed to have received from another Morgellons patient.
He posted this close-up photo of one of the fibers in the sample, where
you can now see the flat cupped shape even more clearly:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704024133/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/morgobs2.htm>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20120704024133/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>carnicominstitute.<wbr>org/<wbr>articles/<wbr>morgobs2.<wbr>htm</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-1.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>Carnicom wrote that the diameter of the fiber was approximately 40
µm, which would be about 3-4 times wider than his earlier fiber that he
said was about 10-12 µm wide. Fibers of cotton typically have a diameter
of about 10-40 µm, or sometimes a narrower range of variation is given
as 12-25 µm. However Carnicom's estimates of the diameter might have a
fairly wide margin of error, because in another post he estimated that a
structure in his image had a diameter between 3 and 10 µm, so his
maximum estimate was more than 3 times higher than his minimum estimate.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602093219/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio11.htm>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20120602093219/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>carnicominstitute.<wbr>org/<wbr>articles/<wbr>bio11.<wbr>htm</a>]
He should've included scale bars in his microscope images.</p>
<p>Carnicom said that his Morgellons filaments were composed of multiple
<span class="quote">"sub-micron filaments"</span> which were packed
together within a <span class="quote">"bounding filament"</span>. By the
<span class="quote">"sub-micron filaments"</span>, he might have
referred to segments of the fiber that were separated by the lengthwise
striations which are characteristic of cotton. In one post he wrote:
<span class="quote">"The diameter of the bounding filament generally
ranges from 20-40 microns in thickness."</span>
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828061439/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/agents1.htm>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20120828061439/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>carnicominstitute.<wbr>org/<wbr>articles/<wbr>agents1.<wbr>htm</a>]
But in a later post, he wrote that the typical diameter of the <span
class="quote">"bounding filament"</span> was 12-20 µm and not 20-40 µm.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705215050/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/culture1.htm>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20120705215050/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>carnicominstitute.<wbr>org/<wbr>articles/<wbr>culture1.<wbr>htm</a>]
But anyway, both 20-40 µm and 12-20 µm fit within the expected range of
diameter for fibers of cotton.</p>
