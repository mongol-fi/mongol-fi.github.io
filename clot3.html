McCairn's connection to Cottrell, Couey, Kulacz, and Webb</a>
</h2>
<p>I wrote about the topics covered in this section in more detail here:
<a href=yt.html>yt.html</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a section for links to websites that are
related to his stream, which used to have links to the websites of J.J.
Couey, Mark Kulacz, Charles Rixey, and a guy on McCairn's Discord who
often goes on his streams, even though at one point McCairn removed the
link to Couey's website.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230329103032/https://www.mccairndojo.com/>http://web.archive.org/web/20230329103032/https://www.mccairndojo.com/</a>]
McCairn, Couey, and Kulacz were all part of a circle of early YouTubers
who were focused on conspiracy content about COVID.</p>
<p>I first found out about Kevin McCairn in March 2020 because he was a
guest on Paul Cottrell's YouTube channel.
[<a href=https://stream.gigaohm.bio/w/pQuDyDr6ayo7n9xZ464Uk5>https://stream.gigaohm.bio/w/pQuDyDr6ayo7n9xZ464Uk5</a>]
It was one of the first videos McCairn did in alt media.</p>
<p>McCairn was later also featured in the first episode of Paul
Cottrell's Coronavirus War Room together with George Webb, and McCairn
and Cottrell participated in a series of video panels hosted by Addy
Adds.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/xsNuoRDvyLIN>https://www.bitchute.com/video/xsNuoRDvyLIN</a>,
<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fxb5SNEnK5vf>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fxb5SNEnK5vf</a>]
The 8 oldest videos at AltCensored that matched Kevin McCairn's name
were all videos posted by Addy Adds:
[<a href=https://altcensored.com/search/new/page/2?q=kevin%20mccairn>https://altcensored.com/search/new/page/2?q=kevin%20mccairn</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnaddy.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>Addy Adds functioned as a mini-me of George Webb, he coauthored
multiple books with George Webb, he did many videos in person with Webb,
and he was Webb's wingman on January 6th. He calls himself a citizen
journalist, like George Webb, Jason Goodman, and Mark Kulacz. Addy even
said that he was knighted by George Webb, but I don't know if it meant
that Webb initiated Addy to become a member of some secret order, like
The Most Excellent and Accepted Rite of Citizen Journalists, or if his
knighting had a more mundane meaning.
[<a href=https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1721435465931174322>https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1721435465931174322</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb also did many videos with Paul Cottrell, who was Webb's
go-to guy on COVID science and Webb's biology teacher. Webb actually
managed to learn an impressive amount of details about COVID biology
from Cottrell.</p>
<p>George Webb has said that he shared an apartment in New York with a
spy lady who worked as a caterer at Epstein's parties and who secretly
videotaped the parties.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I&start=1m39s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I&amp;start=1m39s</a>,

Webb has also said that he has homies at French Mossad.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ</a>]
In one video he listed his intelligence connections, and he said <span
class="quote">"when you start way smarter than your IQ, there's a good
chance there's an intelligence person behind you making you
smarter"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=16m41s>https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=16m41s</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb has also said that he worked with Dutch intelligence in
New York.
[<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s>https://www.pscp.tv/webb4bernie/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s</a>]
He wrote a book about Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, which is
where J.J. Couey used to work, and George Webb was also the main person
in alt media who covered a mass shooting at the Erasmus Medical Center.
George Webb used to be the sidekick of Jason Goodman, whose current
sidekick John Cullen speaks Dutch.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Even crazier when you realize
that my first ever live streams of any kind were invites to join Paul
Cottrell of Operation George Webb, Addy Ads of Operation George Webb,
and McCairn...five weekends in a row. McCairn had a solo stream with
Ads-Webb one week before. All in on it."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1827727108979724547>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1827727108979724547</a>]
But Couey leaves out how his BFF Mark Kulacz was also part of the same
circle surrounding George Webb.</p>
<p>In early 2020 both Kulacz and Webb were speculating that SARS-CoV-2
was created in Fort Detrick by Sina Bavari's team, even though I don't
know which one of them came up with the theory first. In 2019 before
Kulacz had started his own YouTube channel, he did his alt media debut
on a channel that was launched by George Webb together with John
O'Loughlin, who is the son of a high-level FBI agent.
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384>https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404>https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380</a>]
Webb did many videos together with O'Loughlin in person, because they
both lived in the DC area, which perhaps not coincidentally is where the
headquarters of various intelligence agencies are located. O'Loughlin is
a retired lawyer who was a member of the DC Bar Association.</p>
<p>Mark Kulacz worked as a <span class="quote">"competitive intelligence
director"</span> at a company called Datto, which was in the news in
2015 after the FBI seized a backup server of Hillary's emails that was
managed by Datto. In 2019 Mark Kulacz came out as a whistleblower about
Datto's role in the email scandal, even though most of what he said was
already public information.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf&#x2d;&#x5f;jI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf-_jI</a>]
At first I thought his big revelation was that the email server was
personally seized by Peter Strzok from the FBI, but Kulacz seems to have
copied the claim about Strzok from an anonymous user on Twitter, who
presented poor evidence for the claim.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520>http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520</a>]
But regardless, Kulacz's past as a whistleblower is interesting, because
Hillary's emails were one of the main topics that George Webb was
focused on before COVID, and Webb had a unique theory that part of the
emails were leaked by Eric Braverman who was the CEO of the Clinton
Foundation.</p>
<p>After Kulacz started his YouTube channel in 2019, the first guest on
his channel was a lawyer from DC whose father was a high-level FBI
agent, and the second guest was Patrick Bergy who worked as a
cyberwarfare expert for the military contractor Dynology.

soon after that he filed his <span class="quote">'qui tam'</span>

However the third person in alt media I found who interviewed Patrick
Bergy was Mark Kulacz, who also calls himself a citizen journalist like
Webb and Goodman.</p>
<p>Bergy is also one of the few people in alt media who has done an
interview with the Cicada 3301 member Thomas Schoenberger, and Bergy has
even used Schoenberger's music as background music in his livestreams.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v29akrm-the-american-awakening-special-edition-thomas-schoenberger-interview-on-mat.html>https://rumble.com/v29akrm-the-american-awakening-special-edition-thomas-schoenberger-interview-on-mat.html</a>]</p>
<p>In April 2020 George Webb's brother reported that Jason Goodman had
declared a cyber war against Cottrell because Cottrell appeared on
Michael Decon's radio show together with Schoenberger.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200419220724/https://sdny.news/2020/04/03/conspiracy-theorist-jason-goodman-launches-into-fake-quack-doctor-paul-cottrell-in-epic-social-media-stereo-rant-after-thomas-schoenberger-video-surfaces/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200419220724/https://sdny.news/2020/04/03/conspiracy-theorist-jason-goodman-launches-into-fake-quack-doctor-paul-cottrell-in-epic-social-media-stereo-rant-after-thomas-schoenberger-video-surfaces/</a>]
During the show Schoenberger said that he had been following Cottrell's
channel since mid-January, and Cottrell was a blessing and he was making
a huge difference.
[<a href=https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-michael-decon-program-217641/episodes/dr-paul-cottrell-thomas-schoen-54538334>https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-michael-decon-program-217641/episodes/dr-paul-cottrell-thomas-schoen-54538334</a>,
time 36:10] Both Schoenberger and Cottrell call themselves polymaths,
but the Cicada 3301 member Marcia Stockton also calls herself a
polymath.
[<a href=https://x.com/AlphaUnseen/>https://x.com/AlphaUnseen/</a>]</p>
<p>Thomas Schoenberger made a video about the origins of Q, where he
said that in 2017 before the first Q drop had been released, he created
a Q puzzle which was part of a Cicada puzzle called Sevens.Exposed.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CBZbzgbwI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CBZbzgbwI</a>]
The website of Cicada 3301 has a list of their alumni which consists of
three people, who are Bruce Clarke who was the director of the Office of
Strategic Research at the CIA, Iona Miller who is a researcher of the
Count of St. Germaine, and Ian Murdock who created Debian Linux.
[<a href=https://www.cicada3301official.com/pages/alumni.html>https://www.cicada3301official.com/pages/alumni.html</a>]
Bruce Clarke was Schoenberger's mentor, and Schoenberger has called
himself a reincarnation of the Count of St. Germain.</p>
<p>Iona Miller's husband Richard Alan Miller has been featured as a
guest of the Leak Project and Oppenheimer Ranch Project channels on
YouTube, which were the first two channels I found where Paul Cottrell
ever appeared as a guest, and in fact Cottrell and Richard Alan Miller
appeared as guests on consecutive episodes of Oppenheimer Ranch Project
in February 2020.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHy6u5Yrwd5lVj0KJnz-i6ubTAPg6CcV>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHy6u5Yrwd5lVj0KJnz-i6ubTAPg6CcV</a>]</p>
<p>Paul Cottrell has a backup channel on YouTube called Abraham Lincoln.
It includes only a single video, which is a video uploaded in 2015 that
consists of a still image of the logo of Cicada 3301, and if you
download the video and create a spectrogram image of the audio channel,
there's a hidden message signed <span class="quote">"3301"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g</a>]
In the comments of the video there's a hint on how to proceed in solving
the puzzle further, but I didn't figure out what the hint meant.</p>
<p>Paul Cottrell also posted a video on his main channel where he
recorded his screen while he played the Abraham Lincoln video. In the
comments someone asked <span class="quote">"What is this?"</span>, but
Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"forward operations"</span>, and
when someone else said it was a puzzle, Cottrell replied <span
class="quote">"much more than a puzzle my friend"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s</a>,
<a href=i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg>i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg</a>]
When I searched for the term <span class="quote">"forward
operations"</span> in double quotes on Google, most results were about
something called <span class="quote">"defend forward operations"</span>
or <span class="quote">"hunt forward operations"</span>, which are terms
that are used in the context of cyber warfare and which refer to
defensive cyber operations.</p>
<p>In addition to the Cicada 3301 video, Cottrell also posted a second
cryptic video that only consisted of text that says <span
class="quote">"STONEHENGE 4-10-4"</span> and no audio.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0</a>]
Someone posted this comment to the video: <span class="quote">"Hello.
Just to say coincidentally there is a skeleton at Stonehenge that was
tagged as no. 4-10-4. He was decapitated and it was rumoured that it may
have been king Arthur."</span> It sounds like something from a Cicada
puzzle, because they often involve historical artifacts or themes like
the Grail legend.</p>
<p>In February 2020 Paul Cottrell posted a short video where he showed a
tweet by Voice of Guo Media, which said that at a critical moment on
June 4th, Miles Guo's people would go against the top level of the CCP.
Then Cottrell said: <span class="quote">"This is code. This is a CIA
code for an operation. And what's happening is you take six for June
4th, 2020, okay. Cause that's the date that he's mentioning. Take the
six for June divided by two, you get three. You take the four for the
date divided by two, you get two. You take 2020, which is two plus zero
plus two plus zero is four. Divide it by two, it's two. When you take
those answers from those ratios, it adds to three, it makes three, two,
two. That is the sign. That's the code that the CIA operation is
happening. There is a takedown of the CCP and this was the launch
code."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6eic01-feb-4-2020-paul-cottrell-voice-of-guo-media-coronavirus-cia-steve-bannon-em.html>https://rumble.com/v6eic01-feb-4-2020-paul-cottrell-voice-of-guo-media-coronavirus-cia-steve-bannon-em.html</a>]
I don't know how he was able to tell that 322 was code specifically for
CIA. But anyway, the video was so ridiculous that there's no way
Cottrell believed it himself, so it seemed like deliberate
disinformation.</p>
<p>In February 2020 Paul Cottrell became known as <span
class="quote">"the American whistleblower"</span> in China after one of
his YouTube videos went viral in China.
[<a href=https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2>https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&amp;gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2</a>]
In the video Cottrell said that a follower of his YouTube channel had
contacted him on Facebook and sent him screenshots of text messages he
received from someone at the CDC, who said that the CDC was hiding the
true number of COVID cases in the United States.
[<a href=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/>https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/</a>]
The screenshots looked fake because they showed the name of the sender
as <span class="quote">"Nancy Messonnier (CDC)"</span>, even though they
were screenshots of the Messages application on iOS which only displays
the first name of the sender.

The same screenshots had been published a few days earlier by the radio
show host Hal Turner, who said that the text messages were not leaked by
the person who received the text messages, but by his 18-year-old son
who took the screenshots on his father's phone.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed>http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed</a>]
When someone on a Chinese website asked if Paul Cottrell's video was
legit, another user linked to Hal Turner's website and indicated that it
supported Cottrell's story.
[<a href=https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679>https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679</a>]
I guess the user on the Chinese website didn't notice that Cottrell and
Turner had a conflicting story about the origin of the text
messages.</p>
<p>Hal Turner worked as an FBI informant according to testimony in court
by his lawyer and himself.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS>http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS</a>,
<a href=https://archive.ph/soTD7#selection-505.0-512%2e0>https://archive.ph/soTD7#selection-505.0-512%2e0</a>]
He even organized a Nazi rally for the FBI in New York.
[<a href=https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181>https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181</a>]
In 2008 Hal Turner was plotting a feigned sequel to the Oklahoma City
bombing together with a patsy he was working with.
[<a href=https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/>https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/</a>]</p>
<p>In 2010 Hal Turner told the New York Times that he <span
class="quote">"answered the call of the federal government to infiltrate
the white supremacist movement"</span>, and he said that his racist
persona was fake, and he told people to <span class="quote">"be
confident that the person you hear on radio is not real life"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html</a>]
Paul Cottrell and Kevin McCairn are both livestreamers, which is
basically the modern-day equivalent of shock jocks on talk radio like
Hal Turner. McCairn makes fun of Stew Peters, but McCairn occupies a
similar niche as Stew, because they are both shock jocks who have
combined coverage of COVID with antisemitic content. Stew Peters serves
a purpose of making antisemites look ridiculous, but McCairn also makes
antisemites look like some kind of juvenile memetic warriors, and his
knowledge about the Jewish question is very superficial.</p>
<p>Kevin McCairn is in his fifties, but he has positioned himself as a
memetic warrior on the internet, and he and his followers make memes
that include characters like Pepe the Frog and Wojak. Mike Benz used to
have a fake white nationalist channel on YouTube called Frame Game
Radio, which he said was part of a project by Jews to infiltrate the
white nationalist movement.
[<a href=https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1710479185028726943>https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1710479185028726943</a>]
The Twitter account of his fake persona reminded me of McCairn, because
Benz's profile picture was a Wojak wearing a Pepe hoodie, and his bio
said that he was a veteran of memetic wars and that he <span
class="quote">"melded metals into memetic ammo"</span>.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825221401/https://twitter.com/FrameGames>https://web.archive.org/web/20170825221401/https://twitter.com/FrameGames</a>]
But both Benz and McCairn seem too old to be posting 4chan memes.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Kevin McCairn has coauthored two scientific papers
about COVID. One of them was a paper he wrote with Richard Fleming,
where they described a stunt where they filmed blood under a microscope
while they applied drops of a COVID vaccine on the blood.
[<a href=https://medwinpublishers.com/article-description.php?artId=9730>https://medwinpublishers.com/article-description.php?artId=9730</a>]
And the other paper was a paper about COVID origins by several members
of DRASTIC, who included Dan Sirotkin and J.J. Couey.
[<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0</a>]</p>
<p>I first found out about J.J. Couey because his YouTube channel was
linked at the top of a blog post by Dan Sirotkin.
[<a href=https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/>https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/</a>]
Couey discussed the blog post in his first two YouTube videos about
COVID. Dan Sirotkin describes himself as a <span class="quote">"former
NSA counterterrorism analyst"</span>, and he went to college on an NSA
scholarship, but as of 2024 he still lived in the DC area where the
headquarters of various intelligence agencies are located. He is also a
Jew like George Webb and Paul Cottrell.
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097</a>]
Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Before DRASTIC existed, there was an
original duo...Dan and his dad. And then I found them, and we became
three. DRASTIC was after this."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320</a>]
So Couey was basically the third member of proto-DRASTIC after Dan and
Karl Sirotkin. I believe McCairn has never been an official member of
DRASTIC, but for example the intro and outro videos for his streams have
been done by FunctionGain, which is possibly an alter ego of Billy
Bostickson who founded DRASTIC.

<p>Christie Laura Grace is another one of the many suspicious people
McCairn is connected to. In May 2025 she and McCairn went on the
Discernable podcast to talk about the calamari clots.
[<a href=https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/>https://discernable.io/confirmed-evidence-of-biological-engineering-and-novel-clotting-with-dr-kevin-mccairn/</a>]
Her pet topic is LNPs, so she predictably says that the calamari clots
are caused by LNPs (in the same way that Geoffrey Norman Pain says that
the clots are caused by endotoxin, and Bryan Ardis says that the clots
are caused by snake venom). McCairn wrote <span class="quote">"I have
covered the LNP's and their propensity for abnormal clots with Christie
Grace on stream multiple times."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1801412652650103294>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1801412652650103294</a>]
In 2023 McCairn, Rixey, and Grace were featured in a video panel hosted
by Philip McMillan, who seems like a disinformation agent because of his
involvement in Greg Harrison's ORF hoax.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYCjFViwBWw>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYCjFViwBWw</a>]
Christie Grace has said that she <span class="quote">"recorded
experimentation on people"</span> using equipment she received from
Project Veritas, because she was going to be a whistleblower for Project
Veritas.
[<a href=i/christie-laura-grace-project-veritas.jpg>i/christie-laura-grace-project-veritas.jpg</a>]
Her story was never released, but nevertheless Project Veritas is
transparently a controlled opposition outlet, so it's suspicious how
Grace was going to be one of their whistleblowers. The DEFUSE proposal
documents were originally released by McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey,
who supposedly got the documents from Major Joseph Murphy, but a few
months later the DEFUSE documents were released again by Project Veritas
with additional commentary by Major Murphy.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I did further research into Addy Adds, I found that in 2021 he
ghostwrote a book for Cirsten Weldon, which is supposed to have sold
about 200,000 USD worth of copies.
[<a href=https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1395768089581608963>https://x.com/OneAddyAdds/status/1395768089581608963</a>,
<a href=https://www.instagram.com/caracirsten/p/CVamlVOLuLz/>https://www.instagram.com/caracirsten/p/CVamlVOLuLz/</a>]
Cirsten Weldon was part of Charlie Ward's trio of Qtard ladies called
Charlie's Angels, which also included Mel K and Ann Vandersteel. George
Webb and Addy Adds did multiple videos with the Qtard ladies and Charlie
Ward. On January 6th Ann Vandersteel handed media passes outside the
Capitol Building to Webb and Addy, who were shown in photos next to
Vandersteel on January 6th.
[<a href=https://x.com/RealGeorgeWebb1/status/1927406385089675489>https://x.com/RealGeorgeWebb1/status/1927406385089675489</a>]
Ann Vandersteel later became the host of Zelenko Report, but in April
2020 an early telehealth site which sold prescriptions for the Zelenko
protocol was launched by Jerome Corsi, who at one point offered a
monthly salary of 9,000 USD to George Webb and Jason Goodman.

Cirsten Weldon is a former Playboy playmate and Mel K is a former porn
actress, but they have both also had minor roles in Hollywood films or
TV. Cirsten Weldon said that her manager also did the shows of the Qtard
channels X22 Report, David Nino Rodriguez, and And We Know.

<h2>
<a href=#Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Solution_of_Scientists id=Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Solution_of_Scientists>Kevin
McCairn's connection to Solution of Scientists</a>
</h2>
<p>In March 2025 McCairn injected pieces of Hirschman's clot into the
heart of a hamster, which died right after the injection. He didn't do a
public stream about the experiment, but he only livestreamed it on his
Discord.</p>
<p>Wayne Crouch made an infographic about how McCairn killed a hamster
after injecting it with <span class="quote">"our amyloid jab clot
samples"</span>. He said that Kevin McCairn was linked to Solution of
Scientists, which is the group that Wayne Crouch and Greg Harrison are
part of. Crouch is supposed to be a journalist, but in his infographic
he somehow managed to misspell the words <span
class="quote">"scientist's"</span>, <span
class="quote">"hampsters"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"acess"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1904696389176803605>https://x.com/WayneC50256258/status/1904696389176803605</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-hampster.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Wayne Crouch also wrote a Facebook post where he referred to the
people who conducted McCairn's experiment as <span
class="quote">"we"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/PureMediaAustralia/posts/pfbid02eEx7h76h64g7Bj1EkBzDkxHGnJ5VrXAubJsnM6eojjGenytdbVhCn6ySdNLWanLHl>https://www.facebook.com/PureMediaAustralia/posts/pfbid02eEx7h76h64g7Bj1EkBzDkxHGnJ5VrXAubJsnM6eojjGenytdbVhCn6ySdNLWanLHl</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-crouch-facebook.jpg width=514>
</div>
<p>Crouch claimed that McCairn's experiment was proof that <span
class="quote">"we will see the rapid death to the shot
recipients"</span>. But if the hamster died within seconds from the
injection, then why haven't vaccinated people died rapidly yet, even
though years have already passed from vaccination? And injecting protein
into the heart is hardly comparable to injecting LNPs filled with RNA
into a muscle.</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 Tom Haviland published a Substack post where he
described McCairn's analysis of the clots.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-the</a>]
Haviland wrote that Greg Harrison was the <span class="quote">"lead
scientist"</span> of a team that was analyzing the clots, and that
Harrison asked Hirschman to send the clots to McCairn, and that Harrison
asked McCairn to check the samples for the presence of prions:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-greg-asked.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Haviland's Substack post included a document called
<code>Kevin_Mccairn_Findings.pdf</code> which described the results of
McCairn's analysis of the clots. The authors of the document were
anonymous, and the document was signed by <span class="quote">"The
Researchers"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-signed.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>McCairn told me he was not involved in writing the document. However
one of the authors was probably Greg Harrison, because the document was
formatted in a similar way as Greg's AI-generated documents. In 2024
Laura Kasner posted another similar PDF about the clots, where the cover
of the PDF said that the <span class="quote">"authors remain anonymous
for safety reasons"</span> even though Kasner wrote that Harrison was
one of the authors.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed</a>]</p>
<p>The document about McCairn's findings said that <span
class="quote">"ORF-19 and ORF-11 are now functionally implicated in the
induction of prionic seeding"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnorf.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The names of ORFs were written with a hyphen in the PDF. The names of
ORFs are normally written without a hyphen, but Greg Harrison and Wayne
Crouch have both written the names of ORFs with a hyphen.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22orf-19%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22orf-19%22&amp;f=live</a>,

<p>McCairn told me on his Discord: <span class="quote">"You seem
incapable of understanding that I am working independently and the only
link is that is that Greg claims to have done some investigation on the
clots. What he has done has nothing to do with my lab analysis."</span>
But I linked to the <code>Kevin_Mccairn_Findings.pdf</code> document and
asked him: <span class="quote">"If you're so independent from Greg et
al. then why did they write this report about your findings?"</span> And
McCairn replied: <span class="quote">"I have no idea, and I did not give
them permission to write that report or associate it with me any
way."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Kevin McCairn's website has a section called <span
class="quote">"Prion Research Investigation Project"</span>. It includes
a stock photo of people in a lab that I thought looked similar to the
stock footage in An Unholy Triad:
[<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/prion-research-investigation-project/>https://synapteklabs.com/prion-research-investigation-project/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>But then I found that McCairn's stock photo came from the same
collection of stock footage that was used in An Unholy Triad:
[<a href=https://elements.envato.com/microbiologist-doctor-taking-a-blood-sample-tube-f-6RYNWUU>https://elements.envato.com/microbiologist-doctor-taking-a-blood-sample-tube-f-6RYNWUU</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-stock-2.jpg width=500><img src=i/clot-stock-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I thought that the stock photo on McCairn's website might be a clue
that the same people who made An Unholy Triad were also involved in
making McCairn's website. McCairn told me that the page on his website
was made by Chris France, who has also made other parts of his website.
But when I asked Chris France how he picked the stock image, he didn't
answer me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Greg's AI seems to have prophesied the results of McCairn's Rt-QuIC
analysis, because in December 2024 Greg wrote: <span class="quote">"Thx
Kevin, will send you emails with word docs attached in which AI is now
telling us we have identified a new blood-born Amyloid-prion disease.
All is conjecture but AI seems highly convinced we shall soon identify

plus a few more techniques to properly nail it. Interesting times
ahead..thx Gregh"</span>

Next in December 2024 Greg said that McCairn was soon going to receive
samples of the clots which Greg called <span class="quote">"our"</span>
samples: <span class="quote">"Thank you Kevin, our embalmer white clot
samples shall soon follow, preserved under Argon/dipped briefly in 70%
ethanol, properly sealed - for both NMR &amp; RT-QuIC amyloid-prion

Later after McCairn had presented the initial results of his analysis,
Greg now said that his AI had confirmed the presence of amyloid prions
with a 95% confidence level: <span class="quote">"Yes - confirmed
amyloid-prion presence with 95% confidence level according to our 3 AI
engines in concert with each other...don't ask me which engines, these are

In March 2025 Greg posted this reply to a tweet about An Unholy Triad:
<span class="quote">"Thank you Wayne &amp; Lisa, Episode 4 will expand
in detail re relative pathogenicity of EACH ORF discovered so far. The
12 embalmers white clots samples provided yesterday to Dr Kevin McCairn

<p>Greg Harrison, Wayne Crouch, and Lisa Johnston are all promoting a
McCairn-style narrative about a coming prion apocalypse. Lisa Johnston
tweeted that <span class="quote">"Planet earth is under attack by
prionic amaloidosis created by man"</span>:

<img src=i/clot-johnston.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Wayne Crouch is the director of a series of AI-generated videos
called An Unholy Triad. The final video in the series presented a
scenario of a prion apocalypse. First vaccinated people started
developing calamari clots, and then prions from the clots ended up in
wastewater, and wastewater carried the prions into the sea. So it led to
the formation of deadly prion rain when the seawater evaporated, and
also fish became full of prions which spread to humans when humans ate
the fish, and in the end all of humanity died:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-unholy-prion.webp width=600>
</div>
<hr />
<p>In February 2025 Kevin McCairn appeared in a panel about the clots
hosted by Steve Kirsch, which also featured Kevin McKernan, Richard
Hirschman, Tom Haviland, and Greg Harrison:
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6k0oav-vsrf-live-164-white-clot-roundtable.html>https://rumble.com/v6k0oav-vsrf-live-164-white-clot-roundtable.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-vsrf-roundtable.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Kirsch is connected to the story about the white clots in multiple
ways, because he was one of the very first big names in alt media who
started talking about the clots, and I think he was the second person
after Jane Ruby who interviewed Richard Hirschman. And Kirsch was the
first person who interviewed Anna Foster and Cary Watkins, who I think
were the next two people after Hirschman who said they had seen the
clots. The Died Suddenly movie also included more footage of Kirsch than
any other person apart from Hirschman. And the results of Haviland's
first survey were published by Kirsch, and Haviland supposedly got the
idea to do the survey after he was connected to Laura Kasner in Kirsch's
Substack comments. Kirsch has also hosted two video roundtables about
the clots, one of which featured two embalmers who I haven't seen appear
anywhere else in alt media. And Kirsch posted two tweets that promoted
An Unholy Triad.</p>
<p>So I thought that McCairn might have somehow become involved with the
clots through Kirsch, because J.J. Couey said: <span
class="quote">"Steve Kirsch wanted me to evaluate Kevin McCairn's grant
proposal in 2022, and we had a nice little text exchange on my phone
about that. And so there again, he even offered to send me to Tokyo to
help him work, and help him do those experiments."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpTQNgFCKZw&t=1h30m25s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpTQNgFCKZw&amp;t=1h30m25s</a>]
So I asked McCairn on his Discord if he was getting paid by Kirsch, but
he told me: <span class="quote">"No money from Kirsch, I did send him a
grant proposal though, he took my grant and proposed a US institute
carry out the work, I didn't see anything beyond that."</span></p>
<p>But perhaps it was a coincidence that McCairn happened to send the
grant proposal to Kirsch, because McCairn doesn't seem to otherwise be
too closely connected to Kirsch.</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 I compiled comprehensive evidence on McCairn's Discord
that Greg's ORFs were a hoax, so McCairn also recognized the ORFs to be
fake. In April 2025 Greg Harrison tweeted: <span class="quote">"And at
this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span
class="quote">'rantings'</span> due to our lack of credible evidence
that any of our ORF stuff actually exists"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892>https://x.com/Greg21143362/status/1908007680406589892</a>]
At first I wasn't sure if Greg was joking or if he actually dropped the
ORF hoax, but McCairn told me on his Discord: <span class="quote">"He
has dropped it because I've reamed him out for it and how fucking stupid
it is to be amplifying LLM hallucinations."</span> And he said: <span
class="quote">"And now I'm aware of the LLM nonsense, I have told them
there will be the strictest scientific standards applied, and I will not
have nonsense like that as an attack vector"</span>. So it seems to have
been McCairn who got Greg to drop the ORF hoax, which might serve as
evidence against a hypothesis that McCairn was somehow complicit in
Greg's disinformation operation. But on the other hand the story about
the ORFs was so clearly fake that it not only discredited Greg but also
people associated with him, which would've motivated people associated
with him to tell him to drop the story.</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on his Discord how he first got connected to
Greg Harrison, he replied: <span class="quote">"Here <span
class="citation" data-cites="Henjin">@Henjin</span> is a screenshot of
first emails, with time stamps with respect to Greg and Richard. Why
don't we start here so you can order your thinking a little better. As
memory serves I was involved in a Skype call, it was a group of
researchers who had been looking at histological sections of blood from
patients that showed microclotting where they presented their
histological findings and I initially advised them on how to proceed to
stain their tissue for presence of amyloid."</span> And later McCairn
also explained: <span class="quote">"As I recall it was meeting with
clinicians who have worked with Richard to begin to measure and quantify
what the clots were. They were trying to do thioflavin staining, but
lacked the equipment necessary for precise histology. He was a part of
that call, I didn't know him but he [Greg] was obviously co-ordinating
with Richard and the clinician group in Alabhama who are treating
amyloidogenic microclots. As they were making procedural errors in
trying to type the tissue, and I had the facilities available, i offered
to process the tissue properly so that histological staining for
amyloids was done correctly. I have received no money from them to do
this or for the subsequent anlayses I have done using RT-QuIC, SEM/EDX
and Raman spectroscopy. All of those methods have confirmed an
amyloidogenic signature. Does that make sense?"</span></p>
<p>So as of now it's more or less clear that Greg's crew is deliberately
producing disinformation, but it's not yet clear if McCairn is complicit
in their operation, or if McCairn is an independent analyst who got
inadvertently involved with Greg's crew because he volunteered to help
with the histological staining analysis, or because he was looking for
samples of the clots to analyze.</p>
<p>But in the case that the clots are fake and Harrison and Hirschman
know themselves the clots are fake, would they trust someone to analyze
the clots who was not in on the scam? People who had presented an
analysis of the clots before McCairn include Mike Adams, Ryan Cole, Ana
Maria Mihalcea, Clifford Carnicom, Diana Wojtkowiak, Zandre Botha, Arne
Burkhardt, and Greg Harrison. But I believe all of them are controlled
opposition. (I explained why I think Burkhardt and Cole are controlled
opposition on my page about turbo cancer, because Burkhard and Cole were
among the earliest people who started promoting the hoax about turbo
cancer: <a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>In March 2025 Philip McMillan did one video about Kevin McCairn's
analysis of calamari clots, one video where he talked about Greg's ORFs
and how McCairn had found the clots were autofluorescent, and another
video about an AI-generated document which had mystery ORFs going up to
ORF100:</p>

<hr />
<p>When I asked Grok to list people who have presented a laboratory
analysis of the calamari clots, the first two people it listed were Mike
Adams and Greg Harrison. Grok said that McCairn's Raman and RT-QuIC
analysis was done by <span class="quote">"Harrison's team"</span>,
because Grok cited a Substack post by Nicolas Hulscher who gave the
impression that McCairn's analysis was done by Harrison's team:

<p>In early 2025 when Greg Harrison and his co-conspirators were
promoting the hoax about the fake ORFs, their biggest cheerleaders on
Twitter were users called CoyoteSanctuary and RexesRule/CatsRule2023.
Both of them also joined Kevin McCairn's Discord around December 2024,
which was after McCairn had started doing videos with Hirschman and
Harrison. Even after I had posted exhaustive evidence on the Discord
that the ORFs were fake, RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary kept defending
Greg's ORFs, and they just told me that I was crazy or that I was a
counterintelligence agent. So I thought they might have been in on the
scam, since otherwise their behavior of defending Greg's hoax did not
seem reasonable.</p>
<p>When I looked into the Twitter profile of RexesRule, I noticed that
her banner image had a seal that said <span
class="quote">"NAVSECGRUDIV"</span> and <span

<p>Wikipedia says:
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Security_Group>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Security_Group</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Naval Security Group (NAVSECGRU) was an organization within the
United States Navy, tasked with intelligence gathering and denial of
intelligence to adversaries. A large part of this is signals
intelligence gathering, cryptology and information assurance. The
NAVSECGRU organization was active from March 1935 to September 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to being part of the Navy, NAVSECGRU was also part of the
National Security Agency's Central Security Service.</p>
<p>The NAVSECGRU organization was transferred to the Naval Network
Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) where its former assets made up the
Information Operations Directorate.</p>

<p><span class="quote">"NAVCAMS EASTPAC"</span> is short for <span

<p>I found a thread where RexesRule wrote: <span class="quote">"My
NAVSECGRU team was the best."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166>https://x.com/CatsRule2023/status/1863653354909389166</a>,

<p>An announcement from 2005 said: <span class="quote">"What was
formerly NAVSECGRU has now become NETWARCOM's Information Operations
Directorate."</span>
[<a href=https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html>https://coldwar-c4i.net/NSG/NNS051005-04.html</a>]
The announcement also said: <span class="quote">"The IO warfare area is
composed of five core integrated capabilities: Electronic Warfare,
Computer Network Operations, Psychological Operations, Military
Deception and Operational Security."</span> So I asked RexesRule if she
worked for the deception capability or psyop capability of NAVSECGRU,
but she didn't answer me.</p>
<p>Later after I got Kevin McCairn to agree with me that Greg's ORFs
were fake, Greg Harrison posted a tweet where he wrote <span
class="quote">"And at this point in time, wish to retract my ORF <span

After that RexesRule and CoyoteSanctuary also seem to have conceded that
the ORFs were fake. However that doesn't mean that they couldn't have
been complicit in Greg's operation, because it wouldn't have made sense
for them to keep supporting Greg's ORF hoax after Greg himself had
dropped it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand it's possible that RexesRule is just a useful
idiot, because the oldest tweet that matched the query
<code>@RexesRule @Greg21143362</code> was only posted in February 2025,
which decreases the likelihood that she would be part of a team that
produces disinformation together with Greg Harrison. And similarly the
oldest tweet that matched <code>@CoyoteSanctuary @Greg21143362</code>
was only posted in December 2024. But before that both RexesRule and
CoyoteSanctuary had frequently interacted with Kevin McCairn.</p>
<p>RexesRule has made many meme-style images where she promotes Kevin
McCairn, and she frequently posts tweets where she asks people to donate
money to McCairn:</p>

<p>Richard Hirschman tweeted an image that was supposed to show a
scanning electron microscope photo of a calamari clot taken by Kevin
McCairn. Hirschman said the image showed amyloid fibrin, but in the
replies Ian Musgrave said it was not correct:
[<a href=https://x.com/ianfmusgrave/status/1915194687507620135>https://x.com/ianfmusgrave/status/1915194687507620135</a>]</p>

<p>This is how McCairn described the image shown by Hirschman: <span

it's only because unfamiliar with looking at these structures, that this

so my cursor is here, right, like this will stick out. And if we look at
this primary branch here, what you see is - fibrin should be a long
smooth rope-like peptide that essentially just overlays itself to form
the network around which platelets and other tissues that form a clot -
can aggregate, okay. Here what you're looking at is a - and so, you're
looking at very abnormal structural properties that are standout to
someone who's familiar with looking at peptides in and of themselves,
okay. And those are these nodular forms, and also - what I would point
out to people is that - pay attention to this thicker filament, right,
and um, in biology, often what you see - and that's not the best example
that I can give for people to think about - is often when you look at a
tree, a tree, as you look at the trunk has a sort of twisting effect to
it, right. It sort of starts at the roots, and it sort of has a rotation
to it, as it goes up to form the branch area of the tree. But the trunk
often, if you pay attention to it, you'll see it has a rotation to it.
And generally in biology, I would say it's a right-hand rotation, it's
the right hand rule of thumb, and you can get into all sorts of
metaphysics around electrodynamics and what that - how that relates to
the body. But in this instance, what you're seeing is that you're seeing
a faster twist - so rotations per unit of distance - than you would
expect to see in normal healthy tissue."</span>

(He kept saying that fibrin was a peptide. But fibrin is not even a
peptide but a protein. Peptides are short chains of about 50 or fewer
amino acids.)</p>
<p>When McCairn showed an SEM image of the same sample at a 250-fold
magnification level, he said: <span class="quote">"Now we're going down
to 250 times, and we're going past what a light microscope can reliably
do."</span> [time 1:43:21] Optical microscopes go up to about 1000x to
1500x magnification level due to the diffraction limit of light, so at
first I was confused by his statement. But ChatGPT said that an SEM at
250x magnification can show more details than an optical microscope at
1500x magnification, which does makes sense. (Even though McCairn's
image at a 5000x magnification level still has a very low level of
detail for an SEM image.)</p>
<p>In the video by McCairn I linked, he also showed images of the same
sample at 250x and 1000x magnification. (Edited later: I replaced the
screenshots from the video with higher-quality images from here:

The area shown in both images is about 25 µm wide (because the text
<span class="quote">"10.0µm"</span> in McCairn's image means that the
entire scale bar is 10 µm wide, and not that the scale bar consist of 10
segments of 10 µm each). In McCairn's image the strands have a diameter
of about 0.2 to 3 µm, but in the other image even the widest strands
have a diameter of only about 0.3 µm:</p>

<p>When I tried to find SEM images of fibrin clots that had a similarly
irregular structure as the branches in McCairn's image, I found the
image below. Image A shows regular spaghetti-like strands of fibrin that
have a fairly uniform diameter of about 0.1 µm. But in image B where
fibrin was clotted in the presence of the lipid DPPC, the fibrin formed
wide irregularly shaped structures, so branches of the structure have a
diameter on the micrometer level like in McCairn's image. Image B was
described like this: <span class="quote">"In contrast, in the DPPC MLV
suspension the heterogeneous large-pore gels are formed with thin
branched fibers and lipid particles incorporated into the gel structure
(Figure 1, B). The images reveal many free fiber terminations. Fibers
appeared to be highly adhesive forming dense mats and tight
bundles."</span> DPPC is a lipid, and MLV means multilamellar vesicle
which is a type of liposome, so the balls circled in image B are balls
of lipid:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-lipid.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>I also found a paper where fibrin clots were created in the presence
of a fibrinolytic compound, which resulted in the formation of wide
fibers with a diameter of about 0.5 to 3 µm:
[<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/20/8/495>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/20/8/495</a>]</p>

<p>The branches in McCairn's image had a diameter of about 0.2 to 3 µm.
ChatGPT said that fibrin structures with a diameter on the micrometer
level are unlikely to consist of individual fibrin polymers, but rather
bundles of multiple fibrin polymers glued together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, fibrin fibers (the building
blocks of a blood clot) have diameters typically in the range of 50 to
200 nanometers (nm), sometimes up to 500 nm. So 0.05-0.5 µm is
usual.</p>
<p>However, under abnormal or pathological conditions, fibrin fibers can
become thicker, but usually not to the extent of 1 µm, and very rarely
close to 10 µm as single fibers.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Bundles of fibers can easily be 1-10 µm in diameter - but those are
<em>multiple fibers glued together</em>, not single fibrin polymers.</p>
<p>Single fibrin fibers, even under weird conditions, very rarely cross
the 1 µm diameter threshold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However later ChatGPT said that even fibers of fibrin with a diameter
over 1 µm might not necessarily consist of multiple narrower fibers
glued together, but wide fibers might also be formed due to a greater
degree of lateral aggregation in the stage where the protofibrils form
into fibrils:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thick fibrin fibers with diameters over 1 micrometer generally form
through a <strong>similar basic polymerization process</strong> as
regular thin fibers (around 0.1 micrometer), but there are important
differences in how they become thick.</p>
<p>Both thick and thin fibrin fibers start with the <strong>same initial
steps</strong>: thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to create fibrin monomers,
which then align end-to-end to form <strong>protofibrils</strong>, and
protofibrils laterally aggregate to form <strong>fibrils</strong>. In
thinner fibers, this lateral aggregation is moderate - a few
protofibrils come together to form a fibril, and those fibrils form
relatively fine fibers.</p>
<p>For <strong>thicker fibers</strong>, the key difference is that
<strong>more extensive lateral association</strong> occurs. Multiple
protofibrils aggregate side-by-side <strong>more completely</strong>,
and sometimes <strong>additional bundling</strong> happens between
already-formed fibrils. There is evidence that under certain conditions
- such as low fibrinogen concentration, low ionic strength, or altered
thrombin activity - <strong>multiple narrow fibers can clump
together</strong> after initial formation, effectively fusing into
<strong>wider fibers</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, thick fibers (&gt;1 µm diameter) can result from <strong>both
mechanisms</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>More extensive lateral aggregation during initial
assembly</strong>, leading to inherently thicker fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Post-assembly bundling or merging</strong> of multiple
narrower fibers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If indeed McCairn's image does even show fibrin structures, then I
don't know if the thickest branches in his image are bundles of multiple
strands of fibrin joined together, or if they are just single wide
strands of fibrin. McCairn said that his image showed misfolded fibrin
because the branches had an irregular and twisted shape, and the
branches didn't look like smooth spaghetti like regular fibrin. But it
may have been because he was looking at structures that were made up of
bundles of fibrin and not individual strands of fibrin. (And the
clumping of the strands may have been if for example the fibrin
structure formed in the presence of a lipid or a fibrinolytic compound,
and not necessarily because the fibrin was misfolded.)</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn why his SEM image had such a poor level of
detail, he said: <span class="quote">"The difference in detail comes
from using a graphene base vs glass slide, and other factors,
backscatter acquisition from surface or combined."</span> When I asked
why he couldn't use a graphene base, he said: <span class="quote">"I use
glass to be able run Raman on the same sample."</span></p>
<p>He also posted another similarly blurry SEM image at a 5000-fold
magnification level (but it does seem to be a real SEM image judging
from the EXIF metadata, which even includes the serial number of the
Hitachi TM4000 instrument):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-blurry.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>One reason why I questioned if McCairn's images were actually taken
with an SEM was that I had the impression McCairn said he had bought his
own SEM, but it would've seemed like an unnecessarily expensive
purchase, and I hadn't seen an SEM in his lab in his videos. For example
in a video where he showed his SEM images, he showed a photo of the
Hitachi TM4000 SEM and he said <span class="quote">"It costs serious
money to go and get this type of data, ok. The machine you're looking at
there is hundreds of thousands of dollars."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6s3wjv-prion-clusters-excess-neuro-burden-in-the-young-promising-therapeutic-lab-d.html?start=6374>https://rumble.com/v6s3wjv-prion-clusters-excess-neuro-burden-in-the-young-promising-therapeutic-lab-d.html?start=6374</a>]
And in a tweet he posted before he had done the SEM and Raman analysis
of the clots, he said that the SEM and Raman analysis would cost him
about 150,000 USD, which made me think he was going to buy his own SEM
instrument.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1871484694598238475>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1871484694598238475</a>]
But McCairn told me on his Discord that he didn't end up buying his own
SEM instrument, but he visited a lab in Japan to do the SEM and Raman
analysis, and he linked to an old video where he visited the same lab
and used the Hitachi TM4000 microscope.
[<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/w/gwHJwtgbTVGZkYNqA1rxe2>https://t.wtyl.live/w/gwHJwtgbTVGZkYNqA1rxe2</a>]

all costs included"</span>:</p>

<p>Richard Hirschman also said: <span class="quote">"We've got now Kevin

that he uses costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not like you
can just walk up somewhere and have this work done."</span>

1:16:59] But he was wrong because McCairn just visited some random lab
to do the SEM and Raman analysis, and it didn't cost him hundreds of
thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One of McCairn's followers went around asking billionaires to donate
money to McCairn because he said McCairn <span class="quote">"LITERALLY

<p>I replied to him: <span class="quote">"Can you share the full chat?
Those responses seem too good to be true, or like they conform too
closely to what you're saying about the clots. Did you previously tell
ChatGPT about your views? It even addressed you as <span
class="quote">'Dr. McCairn'</span>."</span> And I showed him the
screenshot below and said that when I gave the same prompt to ChatGPT on
a fresh account, it didn't say anything about fibrin clots, but it said
that <span class="quote">"The fibrous network resembles that of
electrospun fibers, biodegradable scaffold materials, or collagen
matrices, commonly used in tissue engineering"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-semgpt-5.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>This was McCairn's explanation: <span class="quote">"That's because I
use the LLM properly, constraining it with a domain specialty based off
my previous published works, and that it's role is to act as a colleague
working in the same domain, with a number of academic based plugins,
e.g., Consensus. As you have no published works in a formal scientific
domain, you are not going to be able to use it in the same manner. And
that was pretty much the extent of the exchange."</span> But he didn't
share the full chat. And Greg Harrison has also trained his AI to
believe in mystery ORFs, so does that mean that mystery ORFs are
real?</p>
<p>Then McCairn told me he wasn't able to share the full chat because
ChatGPT said <span class="quote">"Sharing conversations with user
uploaded images is not yet supported"</span>, which does seem to be a
real limitation of ChatGPT, but which was also convenient for him.

And it's not even possible to save the full chat history by printing to
PDF or by taking a screenshot of the body node in devtools.</p>
<p>When I showed the same image to ChatGPT and asked <span
class="quote">"what would cause fibrin to have this shape"</span>, it
gave me a list of 7 possible reasons, but they didn't even include the
fibrin being misfolded:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibrinshape.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>Added later: When I asked McCairn why the strands in his image have a
diameter of about 3-30 µm even though strands of fibrin normally have a
diameter of about 0.1 µm, he replied: <span class="quote">"That would be
because they are highly amyloidogenic and diseased as is obvious through
the structural abnormalities, which is supported by the positive signals
with thioflavin, Raman spec, and reactivity under RT-QuIC
protocols."</span>

But I don't know how he can be so sure about it, if he hasn't even
looked at regular fibrin clots under an SEM. I had a hard time even
finding images of what <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic"</span> fibrin
clots are supposed to look like.</p>
<p>When I tried searching for more images of unusually thick amyloid
clots, I found the image below where image A is a normal control, and
images B to D were abnormal clots from patients with rheumatoid
arthritis. Image C has some some strands that have a diameter of about
0.3 µm, but it mostly just looks like several narrower strands of fibrin
joined together:
[<a href=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.577523/full>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.577523/full</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-thick-pretorius-kell.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>But in general the structures in McCairn's image look like they are
outside the range of variation of what SEM images of fibrin clots look
like, even if the clots are abnormal. The strands in the clots don't
have such variable width as McCairn's strands, or if they do then the
wider segments look like they consis of multiple strands joined
together, and not a single solid wide strand.</p>
<p>McCairn posted this tweet:

<p>But I told him that the average fiber diameter in the group treated
with LPS is still about 100 nm. And in all images there's a much higher
number of strands visible than in his image, even though the area shown
in the images is about 8 µm wide, but the area in his image is about 25
µm wide.</p>
<p>And I posted this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h3>
<p><strong>Image 1 (Cryostat Sliced Sample at 5000X):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 10 µm</li>
<li><strong>Magnification:</strong> 5000X</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The fibrin or fibrous structures
appear <strong>thicker, less organized</strong>, and more sponge-like or
amorphous. There is an absence of the distinct linear fiber morphology
typical of fibrin networks.</li>
<li><strong>Possible interpretation:</strong> This might not be a
classical fibrin network; it could be a cross-linked, dehydrated, or
otherwise altered biological matrix, possibly involving extracellular
matrix or degraded clot components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image 2 (Fibrin with and without LPS, 1 µm
scale):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 1 µm</li>
<li><strong>Panels (a), (b), (c):</strong> Clearly show <strong>classic
fibrin fibers</strong> - long, thin, thread-like structures.</li>
<li><strong>Panel (d):</strong> Quantifies fiber diameters: control
fibers have a median around 103-133 nm, while LPS-exposed fibers are
thicker (~165-347 nm), but still distinctly fibrous.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scale-comparison">Scale Comparison</h3>
<ul>
<li>Image 1 has a 10 µm scale bar, while Image 2 has a 1 µm scale
bar.</li>
<li>Even adjusting for this, Image 1 shows <strong>much thicker and less
defined structures</strong>, not matching the characteristic ~100-300 nm
fibrin fibers seen in Image 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>The structures in Image 1 are not consistent with classic
fibrin fibers</strong> as seen in Image 2, either due to differences in
sample preparation (e.g., cryostat slicing), degradation, or they
represent a different biological material altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also told him that his image has a lot of variability in diameter
within different parts of the same strand, and I told him ChatGPT
offered the following as possible explanations for the variability in
diameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="cryostat-slicing-artifacts">1. Cryostat Slicing Artifacts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cryostat sectioning at <strong>5 µm</strong> can compress or shear
soft tissues and networks.</li>
<li>Uneven mechanical forces during slicing can deform fibrin strands,
leading to <strong>local thinning or broadening</strong> along the same
strand.</li>
<li>Ice crystal formation and sublimation during freezing can create
voids or distortions, especially in hydrated networks like fibrin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sem-imaging-of-hydrated-or-non-coated-samples">2. SEM Imaging of
Hydrated or Non-Coated Samples</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the sample was not <strong>properly fixed, dehydrated, and
sputter-coated</strong>, charging effects or dehydration shrinkage can
cause parts of the strand to collapse or appear thicker/thinner.</li>
<li><strong>Beam interaction</strong> in SEM (15 kV in this case) can
exaggerate differences in apparent thickness depending on density and
topography.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biological-heterogeneity-in-fibrin-structure">3. Biological
Heterogeneity in Fibrin Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin fibers are <strong>not perfectly uniform</strong>; they can
merge, branch, or bundle. This causes <strong>natural variation in
diameter</strong>, especially in cross-linked or aged clots.</li>
<li>Regions of <strong>dense cross-linking</strong> or association with
other clot components (e.g., platelets, RBC ghosts, ECM proteins) may
appear thicker or more amorphous.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone should try to run SEM on a fresh calamari clot that has just
been extracted for comparison, if such a thing even existed.</p>
<p>McCairn told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don't you in your input for your weak LLM rebuttals the following
additional data.</p>
<p>1. The material has extensive autofluorescence.<br> 2. The tissue
stains positive with thioflavin<br> 3. The sample test positive for
Raman peak at 1720cm<br> 4. The clot causes a positive amyloidogenic
cascade in the RT-QuIC protocol.</p>
<p>Then put the response, here for all to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I posted the response below and wrote: <span class="quote">"Well
it did say your points explain the structure of your image, even though
I don't know if it's a case of the bias where LLMs tend to agree with
the user."</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the listed observations strongly support that the structure in
<strong>Image 1</strong> is <strong>amyloidogenic</strong>, which
explains the atypical, <strong>irregular, matted, and dense
morphology</strong> seen in the SEM image.</p>
<p>Here's how each point aligns:</p>
<h3 id="extensive-autofluorescence">1. Extensive Autofluorescence</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils are known to exhibit autofluorescence due to their
<strong>cross-β-sheet structure</strong> and <strong>dense protein
packing</strong>, which alter their optical properties. This supports
the presence of <strong>protein aggregates</strong> rather than normal
fibrin fibers.</p>
<h3 id="positive-thioflavin-staining">2. Positive Thioflavin
Staining</h3>
<p>Thioflavin (T or S) binds specifically to <strong>β-sheet-rich
amyloid structures</strong>. A positive result confirms that the fibrin
in the clot has undergone a pathological conformational change to form
<strong>amyloid-like aggregates</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="raman-peak-at-1720-cm¹">3. Raman Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹</h3>
<p>A peak near 1720 cm⁻¹ is typically associated with <strong>carbonyl
vibrations (C=O)</strong> and <strong>altered protein secondary
structure</strong>, commonly found in <strong>amyloid fibrils</strong>
or oxidatively modified proteins. This suggests structural changes
consistent with amyloidosis.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rt-quic-amyloid-cascade">4. Positive RT-QuIC Amyloid
Cascade</h3>
<p>RT-QuIC detects the <strong>seeding activity</strong> of misfolded
proteins. A positive result indicates the sample can <strong>propagate
amyloid-like fibril formation</strong>, confirming prion-like behavior,
which is incompatible with normal fibrin function.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These findings indicate that the material in Image 1 is not standard
fibrin but is <strong>misfolded, amyloidogenic fibrin(ogen)</strong>.
This explains the abnormal morphology: <strong>thick, irregular, matted
strands</strong> lacking the well-ordered, thread-like appearance of
healthy fibrin networks (as seen in Image 2). This pathology is often
observed in <strong>chronic inflammation, sepsis, or systemic
amyloidosis-like clotting disorders.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I further asked <span class="quote">"do amyloid properties
explain why image 1 has only a few strands visible, wide strands, and
high variability in diameter within strands"</span>, I got the following
answer from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="few-visible-strands">1. Few Visible Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloidogenic fibrin tends to <strong>aggregate into dense, fused
masses</strong> rather than forming discrete, well-separated fibers.
Misfolded fibrin(ogen) often loses the ability to form normal polymeric
networks, instead creating <strong>amorphous or sheet-like
clumps</strong>. This results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer discernible individual fibers</li>
<li>More extensive background material or merged structures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wide-strands">2. Wide Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils in blood clots form through <strong>cross-β-sheet
stacking</strong>, which encourages <strong>lateral association</strong>
of protofibrils. This can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the <strong>apparent diameter</strong> of strands</li>
<li>Create <strong>flattened, ribbon-like structures</strong></li>
<li>Produce fibers much thicker than physiological fibrin (~100-300 nm),
consistent with what's seen in Image 1 (often several microns wide)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-variability-in-diameter-within-strands">3. High Variability
in Diameter Within Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid formation is a <strong>heterogeneous and non-uniform
process</strong>, influenced by local:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeding concentrations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oxidative stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interactions with other biomolecules</strong> (e.g. lipids,
LPS, iron)</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregular lateral growth</li>
<li>Incomplete or uneven fibril merging</li>
<li><strong>Segmental variation in strand width</strong> (i.e., bulges,
tapering, or constricted areas)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Yes - <strong>amyloidogenesis fundamentally alters the structure and
assembly of fibrin</strong>, and this explains the <strong>low fiber
count, wide fused strands, and diameter variability</strong> in Image 1.
These features are consistent with a <strong>pathological, amyloid-rich
clot</strong>, not a normal fibrin network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his presentations McCairn should've offered a similar explanation
for why amyloid properties might explain the anomalous features. I don't
recall McCairn having said anything about the unusual diameter of the
strands until I brought it up on his Discord, let alone offer an
explanation for why the wide diameter might be explained by amyloid
properties. And he similarly hasn't brought attention to how his image
shows only a small number of individual strands compared to other SEM
images of fibrin clots that display a comparable area, let alone offer
an explanation for why that would be the case.</p>
<p>And in order to evaluate whether the properties he observed were due
to the preservation or preparation of the sample, McCairn could've also
taken an SEM image of a freshly extracted calamari clot for comparison,
or an image of a regular non-calamari fibrin clot that had been
preserved and prepared the same way as his sample.</p>

<p>A user on Kevin McCairn's Discord called Mr. Micronicle has been

<p>Mr. Micronicle also said that he took microscope photos of his blood
stained with Thioflavin T, and he showed an image of a fiber-like object
with a diameter of about 10-20 µm. Then Kevin McCairn said <span

</div>
<p>I posted this reply to McCairn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be an aggregate structure that consists of multiple
fibrils? A single fibril would be much narrower based on what ChatGPT
said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amyloid fibrils are very thin protein aggregates.</li>
<li>Their diameter typically ranges from 7 to 13 nanometers (nm),
regardless of where they form (blood, organs, brain, etc.).</li>
<li>In blood-related diseases like AA amyloidosis or AL amyloidosis,
amyloid fibrils circulate or deposit, and their size remains in that
typical range.</li>
<li>Cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) and atomic force microscopy
studies have shown that some fibrils can be as thin as 6 nm or up to
about 15 nm, depending on the specific protein involved and conditions
of formation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn responded: <span class="quote">"All peptides are aggregate
structures. Depends on the method of aggregation though and their
resistance to proteases as to how we classify them as
pathogenic."</span> But I showed that ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In scientific terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibril</strong> is understood to be a <strong>very
thin</strong>, <strong>elongated</strong> structure, usually <strong>in
the nanometer scale</strong> for diameter (approximately <strong>7-13
nanometers</strong> for amyloid fibrils).</li>
<li>Structures that are <strong>micrometers wide</strong> (especially
<strong>10 micrometers</strong>, which is about <strong>1,000 times
thicker</strong> than a typical fibril) would more accurately be called:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundles of fibrils</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aggregates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fibers</strong> or <strong>fiber-like structures</strong>
(sometimes used when many fibrils associate)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a <strong>10 micrometer</strong>-wide formation would be
considered a <strong>fiber</strong> or an <strong>aggregate of
fibrils</strong>, rather than a single fibril itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"It is a fibril, singular, of
oligomerized amyloidogenic fibrin. That description is correct."</span>
But I showed him that ChatGPT responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In principle, <strong>no</strong> - if you are using a
<strong>standard light microscope</strong>, it would not be possible to
image <strong>a single fibril</strong> of <strong>oligomerized
amyloidogenic fibrin</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>single fibril</strong> (even one formed by fibrin adopting
amyloid-like structure) would have a <strong>diameter of around 6-15
nanometers</strong>, sometimes slightly thicker depending on
conditions.</li>
<li>The <strong>diffraction limit</strong> of optical microscopy
(~200-250 nm) means anything thinner than that cannot be resolved as a
distinct object.</li>
<li>Therefore, under a standard light microscope, what you would see
would be <strong>aggregates</strong>, <strong>bundles</strong>, or
<strong>dense regions</strong> of multiple fibrils - not an isolated,
singular fibril.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"Fibrils (from Latin
<em>fibra</em>[1]) are structural biological materials found in nearly
all living organisms. Not to be confused with fibers or filaments,
fibrils tend to have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nanometers
(whereas fibers are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have
diameters approximately 10-50 nanometers in size)."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril</a>]</p>
<p>McCairn's defense was that the calamari clots were a novel phenomenon
that required a novel vernacular, so it was acceptable for him to use
the word <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> in an unconventional sense.
He told me: <span class="quote">"Trying to use old vernacular to a new
blood prion disorder will lead the spergs like you to blow a fuse, but
you'll just have to put up with it."</span></p>
<p>Then McCairn said this about the clots: <span class="quote">"Nothing
<span class="citation" data-cites="henjin">@henjin</span> is sore that
there have been multiple replications of the same phenomena and that
they satisfy the metrics required to call them amyloidogenic
peptides."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"You mean the
fibrin or other proteins in the clots contain segments that act as
amyloidogenic peptides? It wouldn't make sense to say that the clots
themselves are amyloidogenic peptides."</span> And I pointed out that
ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, <strong>no</strong>, it is <strong>not
accurate</strong> to say that <strong>fibrin clots themselves</strong>
are <strong>amyloidogenic peptides</strong>. Here is the proper
interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>peptide</strong> refers to a <strong>small chain of amino
acids</strong>, typically much shorter than full proteins.</li>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is a <strong>full-length, large polymeric
protein</strong> (~340 kDa before cleavage), not a small peptide.</li>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is a <strong>macroscopic
network</strong> formed by <strong>polymerized fibrin monomers</strong>,
often extending hundreds of micrometers across - not a single molecular
entity or a simple peptide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>fibrin clot</strong> is <strong>not</strong> itself a
<strong>peptide</strong>. It is a <strong>supramolecular
structure</strong> made of many fibrin molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloidogenic peptides</strong> are <strong>smaller
fragments</strong> or <strong>sequences</strong> capable of forming
amyloid fibrils on their own.</li>
<li>In pathological conditions, <strong>portions of the fibrin
molecule</strong> <strong>become amyloidogenic</strong> - <strong>but
the entire clot</strong> should be referred to as an
<strong>amyloid-rich structure</strong> or <strong>amyloid-like fibrin
network</strong>, <strong>not</strong> as a <span
class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accurate phrasing would be</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="quote">"Fibrin clots can adopt <strong>amyloid-like
structures</strong>."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Amyloid fibrin contains <strong>amyloidogenic
regions</strong> within the fibrin protein."</span></li>
<li><span class="quote">"Pathological fibrin clots exhibit
<strong>amyloid features</strong>."</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then McCairn just said that <span class="quote">"we are dealing with
a novel phenomenon, and as such the current repertoire of nomenclature
does not fit well"</span>. But he wasn't willing to admit that he used
the wrong terminology.</p>
<p>Earlier I had also called him out for saying that fibrin was a
peptide, even though a peptide is a short chain of 50 or fewer amino
acids, but fibrin is a polymerized protein product of fibrinogen, and
each fibrinogen unit in turn is made up of 6 proteins that each have a
length of about 400-600 amino acids. McCairn's response was that <span
class="quote">"You should also be reminded that the vernacular peptide
and protein are interchangeable."</span> But I pointed out that ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it would <strong>not</strong> really be correct - even in casual
speech - to call <strong>fibrin</strong> a <strong>peptide</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrin</strong> is <strong>very large</strong> - it's made
by polymerizing fibrinogen, which itself is almost <strong>3000 amino
acids</strong> long.</li>
<li>Even a <strong>single fibrin monomer</strong> (before
polymerization) is <strong>way too big</strong> to be called a <span
class="quote">"peptide."</span></li>
<li><strong>Peptides</strong> usually refer to <strong>short
chains</strong> - dozens, or maybe a few hundred amino acids at
most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling fibrin a <strong>peptide</strong> would sound wrong to most
people familiar with biology, even casually. It's much better (and more
natural) to call fibrin a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Polymerized protein</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Fibrillar protein</strong>, depending on context.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If Kevin McCairn sees a fiber-like structure under a microscope, he
says it's an amyloid fibril, in the same way that Ana Maria Mihalcea
would say the same fiber is a Morgellons fiber or a carbon nanotube, and
Mike Adams would say it's a nanowire interface structure.</p>
<p>McCairn gets mad at me when I compare him to the nanobot guys, but
when I asked Grok to list people who have analyzed the calamari clots in
a lab, it told me: <span class="quote">"The individuals listed primarily
rely on anecdotal observations, microscopy, or preliminary laboratory
tests (e.g., RT-QuIC, spectroscopy) without peer-reviewed publication or
independent replication. Their claims often involve nanotechnology,
synthetic biology, or prion-like structures, which are not supported by
mainstream medical research."</span></p>

<p>I think he is using the term <span class="quote">"fibril"</span>
wrong, because ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <strong>"fibril"</strong> is typically used in biology and
materials science to refer to <strong>very fine fibers</strong>, often
in the <strong>nanometer to low micrometer scale</strong> (usually less
than 1 µm in diameter). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrils</strong> are generally <strong>5-15
nanometers</strong> in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Collagen fibrils</strong> are typically <strong>50-500

<p>The same image was featured on a section of McCairn's website where

<p>ChatGPT said that the black structure was not an amyloid fibril based
on its size, but it said it might have a synthetic fiber or a fungal
hypha. It said this about the fine white network pattern that surrounded
the dark structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resembles a <strong>diffraction or interference pattern</strong>
and could arise from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase contrast or DIC microscopy artifacts</strong>,
especially when imaging something highly refractive or birefringent like
crystallized proteins or aggregated biomolecules.</li>
<li>A <strong>precipitation halo</strong> from protein or salt
crystallization.</li>
<li><strong>Denatured protein boundaries</strong>, especially if the
sample was dried or subjected to UV exposure, forming boundary rings due
to concentration gradients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: If this is a dried biological or
chemical sample, the white halo could represent
<strong>diffusion-limited growth</strong>, <strong>protein aggregation
boundaries</strong>, or <strong>optical artifacts</strong> around a
dense core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn said that the pattern that looked like cracked glass <span
class="quote">"comes from the dried solute after adding ThT"</span>, and
he said that Chris France writes his website ChatGPT but he just OKs it
for publication.</p>
<p>The next image shows the same fiber as the previous image but under a
UV light. McCairn said about the fiber: <span class="quote">"That whole
structure is fluorescing green. That tells me it's highly likely that
we're looking at an amyloid structure."</span>

But I didn't see him showing if the fiber was already autofluorescent
before he did the ThT staining. On his website McCairn described the
fiber as a <span class="quote">"fibril"</span>, even though in one of
his presentation where he showed a version of the image with a scale
bar, the structure in the image was shown to be about 15 µm wide:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-3.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>The structure in the image above has a fold that runs along the
middle lengthwise. When I asked McCairn on his Discord what the fold
was, he said <span class="quote">"And the fold running length wise is
indicative of it being a coherent structure, that is one of the reasons
why fibril is a fair description of the phenomenon. Again this is you
running into the axiom of those that can and those that can't. This is a
highly unusual amyloidogenic form."</span> And when I said the structure
was too big to be called a fibril, he said: <span class="quote">"And one
could say fibrillar forms, but fibrils is good enough at this stage,
again because of the extremely large size differential between normal
amyloids and these unusual fibrin amyloids."</span> Then I asked someone
else: <span class="quote">"How do you even know that the structures
shown by McCairn and Micronicle are fibrin clots? I think fibrin clots
wouldn't have the kind of lengthwise fold in the middle as McCairn's
green mystery fibril."</span> But McCairn replied: <span
class="quote">"This objection to raw data comes from your years of
extensive lab experience working with amyloids, I presume?"</span> He
also seemed to suggest that the mystery fiber he showed on his website
were the same type of structure as the mystery fiber in Mr. Micronicle's
microscope image.</p>
<p>But are there even baby calamari clots that float freely in human
blood, and that have a diameter of about 10 micrometers and a length of
hundreds of micrometers?</p>
<p>The purpose of fibers of fibrin is to form a mesh that gets entangled
with red blood cells, so the tangled mess forms a clot that blocks a
punctured blood vessel:
[<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1472>https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1472</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-web.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>The reason why large clots have elongated shape is because they
conform to the shape of a blood vessel, like if some entangled sticky
mess was poured through a tube and the tube got clogged.</p>
<p>But if there's a micrometer-scale fibrin clot that floats freely in
the blood, why would it also have an elongated shape? Did it form inside
a small blood vessel and then get dislodged?</p>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="fibrin-clot-structure-in-situ">1. Fibrin Clot Structure In
Situ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin forms a <strong>mesh or network</strong> of thin fibers
during clot formation, creating a <strong>gel-like matrix</strong> that
stabilizes platelets and red blood cells.</li>
<li>This structure is <strong>highly entangled and irregular</strong>,
not a single, uniform fiber.</li>

<li>When parts of a fibrin-rich thrombus <strong>dislodge and enter

</ul>
<h3 id="fiber-like-structures">3. Fiber-like Structures?</h3>

<li>You will <strong>not see individual fibers</strong> moving freely in
the bloodstream in vivo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked McCairn that if his green structure formed inside a small
blood vessel and then got dislodged, then why is it flat, and why does
it have the lengthwise fold in the middle. He answered: <span
class="quote">"Good question why does this diseased protein have the
form it does, it should be noted it's not the only form there are
irregular &amp; spheroid forms. I think it comes down to location of
formation, nature of the underlying nano-scale fibril geometry, the
species of protein, fibrinogen which makes long linear forms. Again we
are in a process of discovery and relying on orthodox frameworks you
constrain yourself to being able to competently describe it. But it's a
common form, even described in the published literature."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>When I asked why the fiber has the lengthwise fold, ChatGPT said that
the fold might be if the fiber is a natural fiber like cotton, where the
hollow lumen in the middle of the fiber has collapsed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lengthwise fold or groove is not characteristic of fibrin or
amyloid aggregates. Instead, it is a <strong>well-known feature of
certain textile or environmental fibers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cotton fibers</strong>: Typically ribbon-like, twisted, and
often show central folds or convolutions due to the collapse of the
hollow lumen inside the natural fiber.</li>
<li><strong>Cellulose fibers (like paper fibers or lint)</strong>: Also
tend to flatten and develop longitudinal folds.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic fibers</strong>: Usually round or oval in
cross-section, smooth, and don't typically have the central fold unless
manufactured with a special cross-section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the ribbon shape, width (tens of micrometers), and the
<strong>longitudinal fold</strong>, this looks much more consistent with
a <strong>collapsed plant-derived cellulose fiber (e.g., cotton
lint)</strong> rather than any protein fibril or clot material.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>McCairn showed on his stream the the green fluorescent ribbon and the
image with a cracked background are part of the same sample.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v5zq84w-operation-blue-drone-and-lessons-in-fluorescent-microscopy-amyloid-signals-.html?start=11565>https://rumble.com/v5zq84w-operation-blue-drone-and-lessons-in-fluorescent-microscopy-amyloid-signals-.html?start=11565</a>]
He claims it was a sample of blood of someone who was injured by a
Moderna vaccine. From the stream you can also see the end of the ribbon
which was cropped out in the photo on his website. It has a torn
appearance that I think is not characteristic of a fibrin clot:</p>

<p>McCairn's post has the air of cheap propaganda due to the emphasis on
harm done to babies. A trope among alt media morticians is that they
have a dramatic story to tell about dead babies, like how Wesley the
funeral director said that there were about 10 times more babies dying
than normally, so the fridges were packed full of dead babies.
[<a href=https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/>https://dailytelegraph.co.nz/news/uk-funeral-director-there-are-10-times-more-dead-babies/</a>]
And Nicky Rupright King said that after the vaccine rollout, she saw new
types of deformities in dead babies she had never seen before, and that
<span class="quote">"the deformities that these children had were
astronomical"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/3Ev4bzcLuj4e/</a>,
24:45] And the anonymous embalmer whose testimony was published by Laura
Kasner wrote that they saw <span class="quote">"an exponential increase
in the number of fetal and infant deaths in 2021"</span>, and she saw
babies that died of SIDS a few days after their breastfeeding mother
received a COVID vaccine, and that <span class="quote">"100% of the
fetal and infant deaths that occurred in 2021 were born to vaccinated
mothers"</span>.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony>https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/embalmer-testimony</a>]</p>
<p>The emphasis of McCairn's post was on scary microscope images, which
is reminiscent of content by the Quinta Columna and Stew Peters crowd.
ChatGPT said this about McCairn's post: <span class="quote">"This
document strongly resembles pseudoscientific or hoax material,
exploiting scientific-sounding language and visual data without meeting
the necessary standards of scientific proof."</span></p>
<p>McCairn showed these images of a mystery fiber he found in the
3-year-old's blood:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnsub-2.webp width=570>
</div>
<p>He also showed images of a second similar fiber, and he described the
fibers he showed as <span class="quote">"autofluorescent fibrillar
structures"</span> and <span class="quote">"UV-reactive fibrillar
microclots"</span> and <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin
microclots"</span>.</p>
<p>Individual strands of fibrin have a string-like shape, because
because their purpose is to form a criss-crossing mesh that traps red
blood cells and that covers a punctured blood vessel. Some large blood
clots have a string-like shape because they conform to the shape of a
blood vessel. But that doesn't mean mini clots that are randomly
floating around in the blood would also have a string-like shape, unless
for example they formed inside a small blood vessel and then got
dislodged.</p>
<p>Strands of fibrin typically have a diameter of about 0.1 µm, which is
about 50 times smaller than the <span class="quote">"fibrillar
structures"</span> shown in McCairn's images.</p>
<p>When Ana Maria Mihalcea sees a fiber-like object under a microscope,
she declares it to be a Morgellons filament or a carbon nanotube. If
McCairn sees the same object, he says it's a baby calamari clot, an
amyloid fibril, or an amyloidogenic peptide. He previously claimed that
this structure with a diameter of about 10-20 µm was an amyloid fibril,
even though in reality amyloid fibrils have a diameter of about 5-20
nm:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-microniclefibril.jpg width=660>
</div>
<p>McCairn also described this structure as a <span
class="quote">"fibril"</span> (which he is supposed to have found in the
blood of a person injured by a Moderna vaccine):
[<a href=https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/>https://synapteklabs.com/protocol-on-sending-blood-samples-2/</a>;

<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairnsub-4.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>The structure in the image above is shown to be about 15 µm wide. But
the word <span class="quote">"fibril"</span> usually refers to
structures with a diameter in the nanometer scale, like amyloid beta
fibrils which are typically 7-13 nm in diameter, or collagen fibrils
which are typically 50-500 nm in diameter. The object in McCairn's image
also has two features that are not consistent with a clot that has an
elongated shape because it formed inside a blood vessel and got
dislodged from the vessel, because the object is flat and wide, and it
has a fold that runs along the middle lengthwise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kevin McCairn left in Markdown bold formatting in one part of his
Substack post. I thought it looked like text copied from some AI
utility, because Substack doesn't even support Markdown. One of Greg
Harrison's AI-generated documents had similar Markdown bold formatting
left in.</p>
<p>When I brought it up to McCairn, he said his post was an AI-generated
summary and he left <span class="quote">"the markdown in for
transparency"</span>. But I don't buy his excuse, because the Markdown
formatting was not even a clear sign that his post was generated by AI,
and it would've been more transparent to explicitly write that his post
was AI-generated.</p>
<p>The Markdown formatting appeared in the heading of a list titled
<span class="quote">"Clinical Case Summary"</span>, so at first I
thought that only the list was generated by AI based on the rest of the
post, and therefore I was wondering why the list mentioned details that
were missing from the rest of the post. But McCairn clarified that the
entire post was an AI summary based on a longer original post:

<p>McCairn supposedly does his blood analysis using slides of blood
mailed by his followers that contain only a small amount of blood, even
though it's not clear if that's how he received the sample of blood of
the 3-year-old. I pointed out that if he keeps finding baby calamari
clots in random samples of blood with a small volume, there should be
vast fleets of baby calamari clots swimming around in the bloodstream of
people. But he refused to even answer me what volume of blood he
analyzed:

<p>The Twitter user Markus pointed out McCairn said one of his
microscope images was taken at a 4-fold magnification, but the scale bar
seemed to indicate it was taken at a much higher magnification level:
[<a href=https://x.com/mar15164/status/1927071726300451325>https://x.com/mar15164/status/1927071726300451325</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said that typically <span class="quote">"the field of view
(FOV) for a 4x objective on a standard microscope with a 10x eyepiece is
around 4-5 mm (4000-5000 µm)"</span>, but McCairn's image showed a width
of only about 550 µm, which is only about 12% of the typical FOV:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibril-markus-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>But McCairn said he didn't even use an eyepiece, so the FOV at 4x
magnification should be about 40-50 mm, which means that the visible
width of his image is only about 1.2% of a typical FOV.</p>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT if an eyepiece can go up to 100x, it said 100x
eyepieces are extremely rare and not practical for most applications,
and typically eyepieces only go up to about 15x or 20x magnification.
When I asked what could explain McCairn's narrow FOV if the image was
taken without an eyepiece, ChatGPT wasn't able to give any reasonable
explanation. But it did say it was possible that the scale bar was wrong
or the magnification level was reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>McCairn replied to me: <span class="quote">"The field of view is not
0.5mm you cretin, the scale bar shows the pixels derived from the camera
using a calibration slide placed on the slide holder. you are looking at
an amyloidogenic fibril that is 100's of micrometers in length and the
scale bar in red shows 50 micrometers not 0.5mm you moron"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928562639476764916>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928562639476764916</a>]
But I replied: <span class="quote">"The scale bar is about 9% of the
width of the image, and 50/.09 is about 550 µm. The field of view means
the width visible in the image."</span> And McCairn said: <span
class="quote">"Again you're wrong about calibrating the scope. And
thread sliding trying to get away from the amyloidogenic clot
data."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"How am I wrong? Is the
field of view not about 0.55 mm? If you didn't even use an eyepiece,
then how do you explain that your FOV is only about a hundredth of a
typical FOV at 4x magnification without an eyepiece?"</span> Then
McCairn said: <span class="quote">"No it isn't go back to your
calculations and think how a stained amyloid structure which by the
scale bar is close to 1mm in length fits in that FOV."</span> But I
replied: <span class="quote">"The scale bar is 94 pixels wide, the image
is 1047 pixels wide, and 94/1047 is about 0.090. The area of the fiber
is about 765 by 260 pixels, and (765^2+260^2)^.5/94*50 is about 430 µm
(but the fiber is not perfectly straight, so you can round the length up
to 500 µm)."</span> But after that he just replied <span
class="quote">"Science is moving on henjin"</span> and linked to his new
Substack post. But I told him: <span class="quote">"You still haven't
explained why the FOV is only about 550 µm if the image is taken at
4-fold magnification."</span> But he said: <span class="quote">"lmfao
how is the fov 0.5mm, tell you henjin, get a scope, get a calibration
reticle and see what you come up with. And the amyloid data is pouring
in, suck on my big, fat, juicy <span class="quote">'fibril'</span>. Feel
its scale invariance pounding your tiny sperg hole!"</span> And I asked:
<span class="quote">"Well what is the FOV then, and how are you supposed
to calculate it? Is my calculation of 1047/94*50 wrong?"</span> Then
another user replied: <span class="quote">"have you ever heard of
something called cropping?"</span> And McCairn answered: <span
class="quote">"These things would be beyond henjin, in his dos, html
world."</span> But I replied: <span class="quote">"So your explanation
for why the FOV is about 1% of a typical FOV at 4x magnification is that
the image was cropped? Did the original image display a 100 times wider
area but you cropped about 1% of the width of the image?"</span> He
didn't answer, but when I later asked the same question again, McCairn
said: <span class="quote">"Irrelevant sperg detail, when you have the
image across 2 different methods and concordance. Simple fact is you
have a large amyloid fibril detected, in the blood, that would fill
clinical criteria for a clot. From nano to macro, the presentation is
parsimonious."</span>

<p>He referred to an SEM image of the same fiber-like object he had now
posted on Substack.
[<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000>https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000</a>]
His SEM image was taken at 40-fold magnification, but the object in the
image now took up about 50% of the FOV:
[<a href=https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000>https://substack.com/home/post/p-164833000</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sem-3yearold.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>So why did the same object take up about 75% of the FOV in the other
image that was supposedly taken at 4-fold magnification?</p>
<p>The object in the new SEM image is about 731 pixels wide, and the 1
mm scale bar is about 460 pixels wide, so the width of the area covered
by the object is about 1.59 mm. But in the earlier optical microscope
image, the width of the area covered by the object was only about 0.38
mm based on the scale bar.</p>
<p>Jikkyleaks asked: <span class="quote">"Kevin are your scales correct
on the SEM pic? In the first picture it looks like that fibril is about
500micrometres long, but the SEM scale is marked in millimetres."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928634205245690299>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1928634205245690299</a>]
But McCairn answered: <span class="quote">"Yes they are dead on
accurate, you are looking at the difference between trying to calibrate
off a glass slide reticle that comes from some Chinese sweat shop
vs. the precision delivered by top off the line SEM. The scales are
within the margin of error between the techniques deployed."</span></p>
<p>I don't know what the ring with the segmented pattern in the SEM
image is, but the segments might be due to dessication. Before McCairn
took the SEM images of the supposed microclot from the 3-year old, he is
supposed to have done ThT staining for the sample. Earlier when I asked
what the pattern that looked like cracked glass was in the image below,
McCairn said it came <span class="quote">"from the dried solute after
adding ThT"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-mysteryfibril.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>But anyway, I still didn't have an answer to why the old microscope
image had a FOV of only about 0.55 mm even though it was supposedly
taken at 4-fold magnification. So I asked McCairn: <span
class="quote">"So was your 4x image cropped or not? If so then what
percentage of the width of the original image did the cropped image
show? It's probably not nearly enough to explain why the FOV was only
about 0.55 mm even though a typical FOV at 4x magnification would be
about 40-50 mm."</span>

He posted a reply where he didn't answer my question, so I asked him
again: <span class="quote">"Was the image cropped or not? It should be a
simple question to answer. Or did you use something like a tube lens or
digital zoom?"</span> I referred to this tweet by Markus:

<p>McCairn seems to routinely screw up the scale bars in his microscope
images. In this image the scale bar is shown to be 10 µm wide, even
though it's about 12-15 red blood cells wide, and red blood cells have a
diameter of about 6-8 µm, which would mean that the scale bar is about
90 µm wide:

<p>McCairn responded <span class="quote">"Yes the scale bar is wrong it
should say 50 micrometers, the 10 micrometers is a holdover from a scene
done for more detailed analysis for an individual who wanted their blood
looked at."</span>

However I think the scale bar looks slightly wider based on the diameter
of the red blood cells.</p>

claimed that he got COVID from the Korean superspreader event 2 to 3
months before the event</a>
</h2>
<p>I have joined Kevin McCairn's Discord server multiple times since
2020, and I was even made into a moderator on the server at one point,
but I have usually left the server after a while because it had a very
low quality of posts. McCairn banned me from the server in May 2025,
because I said that the calamari clots were fake and he was probably
controlled opposition.</p>
<p>Since his early videos in 2020, McCairn has said that he almost died
after he got COVID from the Korean superspreader event in Daegu. He said
he had severe neurological symptoms, which was a reason why he knew that
COVID had a neurotropic effect and he decided to focus on researching
the neurological aspects of COVID.</p>
<p>However the problem with his story is that the Korean superspreader
event occurred in February 2020, but McCairn says that he was in Daegu
from late November into December 2019. I haven't seen anyone call him
out for his claim until I brought it up on his Discord:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-earlycovid.webp width=691 height=6062>
</div>
<p>I used to think McCairn probably had some other illness but he
mistook it for COVID, but after I found out how there's also many other
people in alt media who claim that they were among the first people who
got COVID in their country, I started to think it's possible that he
just made up the whole story about having COVID.</p>
<p>It also seemed like an unlikely coincidence that McCairn was an early
YouTube streamer who was focused on COVID, but he also happened to be at
the right place at the right time to get infected with COVID very early
on. Often if a fabulist invents an embellished biography for themselves,
they insert themselves in various locations over the world at a time
when some event of historical importance happens to occur at the
location. But the Korean superspreader event was probably the best-known
event that occurred in Korea in the year of 2020.</p>
<p>In the unlikely scenario where McCairn is not lying and he was
actually infected with COVID in November or December 2019, he might have
been the first person with COVID in Japan, because he claims that he was
still sick with COVID after he returned home to Japan in December
2019.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above I pointed out how Steve Pieczenik claimed
that he was the first case of COVID in the United States, and he claimed
that he got COVID after he met with a Chinese student from Wuhan
(because I guess he didn't count the student as an earlier case of COVID
in the United States).
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dq8v0zZpVCCe/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dq8v0zZpVCCe/</a>,
22:08] But how did Pieczenik even know what city the student came from?
At the time Americans were not yet familiar with Wuhan, and it wouldn't
have meant much to Americans what Chinese city the student came from.
And similarly John Mark Dougan lives in Russia where there's only about
20,000 Chinese people in the entire country, but he claimed that he got
COVID after he went to an immigration office where he saw Chinese people
wearing masks. So in the same way that Pieczenik happened to
conveniently come in contact with a student from the right Chinese city,
and Dougan happened to convenently come in contact with Chinese people
in a country where there's almost no Chinese people, McCairn also
happened to conveniently visit the right city in Korea at the right time
so he could catch COVID.</p>
<p>I don't know if McCairn actually even visited Daegu in 2019 like he
claims, but in one video he also said: <span class="quote">"I got hit by
the biggest superspreader event in Asia, right early on, in November to
December."</span>

<p>Kevin McCairn's American sidekick Charles Rixey also claims that he
got COVID at a time when there were only a few recorded COVID cases in
the US:

<p>I listened to several of the videos, but McCairn only said he may
have gotten COVID in Daegu in one of the videos, which was a video he
did with Addy Adds in March 2020. In the video McCairn said: <span
class="quote">"And, uh, where I had my lab, which was in South Korea in
a city called Daegu, they'd asked me to sort of come and give a, uh, to
help them in a project they were doing. And that time was October, no,
sorry, November - I want to say it was November into December, but late
November, right. And at that time, um, I came back, and over the
Christmas period, I got really, really ill, right. And, um, it's sort of
left - like the fever I was delirious, so I can't - and again, so I get
memory issues because of the head injury. And so apparently when I was
in the fever bit, I was coming downstairs and thinking days had passed.
And, uh, it, it wasn't, you know, and it took me a week to sort of get
over that. And then I was left just, um, with, it's called dyspnea where
you can't really breathe."</span>
[<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/w/eafNsjv7kWn2VLTdyMisfA?start=1h26m22s>https://t.wtyl.live/w/eafNsjv7kWn2VLTdyMisfA?start=1h26m22s</a>]
Then Addy asked if McCairn had COVID, and McCairn said yes, and he
talked about how the Shincheonji cult had a church in Wuhan. And then
Addy said: <span class="quote">"There's a group of superspreaders there,
then."</span> And McCairn said: <span class="quote">"Yeah, and I
literally, I literally caught this, um, this illness and, uh,
Shincheonji, it's called. [...] So I think I did get an exposure, because
a lot of my symptoms fit, and it even left me with sort of, uh, angina
and chest pain. And so a lot of these these symptoms that people were
describing, I was like, <span class="quote">'oh'</span>."</span></p>

</h2>
<p>I have pointed out to McCairn that individual fibrils of fibrin have
a string-like shape because their purpose is to form a mesh that traps
red blood cells. And large blood clots have an elongated shape because
they conform to the shape of blood vessels. But that doesn't mean that
intermediate-scale formations of fibrin would also have an elongated
string-like shape, unless for example they formed inside a small blood
vessel and then got dislodged from the vessel.</p>
<p>When McCairn looked at a sample of blood from a 3-year-old under a
microscope, he is supposed to have found this string-shaped fibrin clot
with a diameter of about 5 µm and a length of about 500 µm:
[<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrils-in-a-post-gestational>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrils-in-a-post-gestational</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-toddler-microclot.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Now in his third Substack post McCairn provided the following
explanation for why his mini clot had a string-like shape: <span
class="quote">"These comparisons between nano- and macro-structures
highlight the conserved geometry of pathological amyloidogenesis. This
scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar architecture aligns with prior
biophysical studies demonstrating that amyloid formation follows
universal thermodynamic pathways, forming twisted ribbon-like or
lamellar structures irrespective of protein species or environmental
origin
(<a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>Chiti
&amp; Dobson, 2017</a>;
<a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045104>Eisenberg
&amp; Sawaya, 2017</a>). The similarity across scales - from
nanometer-thick fibrils to centimeter-scale clots - suggests a deeply
encoded biophysical template likely seeded by persistent amyloidogenic
peptides, such as SARS-CoV-2 spike protein."</span></p>
<p>However I'm not convinced by his explanation, and I didn't find any
part in the two papers he linked that would've explained why amyloid
formations on the micrometer scale would have a string-like shape.</p>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT to describe the shape of different types of
micrometer-scale amyloid formations in the human body, it gave me the
following list:</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said that IAPP/amylin forms <span class="quote">"sheet-like
or intercellular ribbon deposits"</span>, but ribbons of IAPP typically
have a diameter of about 10-15 nanometers. ChatGPT listed only type of
amyloid formation that had a string-like shape, which were the
microclots associated with long COVID. But I couldn't get ChatGPT to
cite any source which said that amyloid clots associated with COVID
actually had a string-like shape, so ChatGPT may have been influenced by
McCairn's Substack post which I had shown to it earlier.</p>
<p>I asked McCairn: <span class="quote">"Is there some specific part of
the papers you cited which says that formations amyloid protein have a
tendency to form into a ribbon-like shape in the micrometer
scale?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1928612282696671237>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1928612282696671237</a>]
But he gave me the following non-answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we go again, you are not looking at the canonical amyloidogenic
form, merely based on the size of the aggregations .</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you this? That is why I as the
domain level expert uses the language as I see fit.</p>
<p>Especially when it reacts to all the diagnostic measurements used to
detect amyloids.</p>
<p>ThT Fluorescence, SEM structural characteristics, RT-QuIC reactivity,
Raman Spectra confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied: <span class="quote">"You suggested amyloid structures have
a <span class="quote">'scale-invariant preservation of fibrillar
architecture'</span> so they have a tendency to form into a ribbon-like
shape on the micro-scale, and you cited two papers from 2017. Which part
of the papers supports your point?"</span> But I didn't get any
answer.</p>
<p>A paper by Pretorius and Kell featured the following images of
microclots, with this caption: <span class="quote">"Representative
micrographs of ThT-positive events passing through the flow cytometer.
All micrographs are obtained at 20x magnification. Each group contains 6
micrographs from different individuals. The image on the left of each
micrograph is obtained from the bright field channel (Ch01), and the
image on the right is obtained from the fluorescent channel (Ch07). The
number in the top left corner of each micrograph represents the event
number within a given sample run."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/clot-pretorius-kell-microclot.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I asked Douglas Kell if his group had also seen the kind of
fiber-like microclots that were shown in McCairn's Substack post, but he
just replied <span class="quote">"these experiments are quite different
so comparisons are not usefully made"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/dbkell/status/1928858289166561296>https://x.com/dbkell/status/1928858289166561296</a>]
Then I asked him: <span class="quote">"McCairn supposedly finds these
mystery ribbons on slides of blood he receives in the mail from his
followers. Have you also tried looking at samples of blood under a
microscope to see if they contain similar formations, or if they contain
amyloid microclots?"</span> But Douglas Kell told me: <span
class="quote">"We have only studied plasma"</span>.</p>
<p>Then McCairn posted this tweet:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928898424038109639>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1928898424038109639</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the experiments conducted by <span class="citation"
data-cites="dbkell">@dbkell</span> and colleagues, the whole blood is
spun in a centrifuge, larger aggregates would be pulled to the bottom of
the tube.</p>
<p>Spinning and looking at the plasma phase would leave the smaller
amyloidogenic seeds in the plasma phase. This allows automated sorting
through techniques like flow cytometry. This is a better approach for
batch processing, you will miss the larger aggregations due to
centripetal forces being greater on larger amyloidogenic forms.</p>
<p>Slide analysis is much slower, requires someone with trained eyes, is
labor intensive, and requires the follow on tests of ThT staining,
SEM/EDX, Raman Spec, for categorization.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: I now asked McCairn again that when he cited the
two papers from 2017, what part of the papers supported his claim that
aggregates of amyloid protein tend to organize into a ribbon-like shape
on the micrometer scale.
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929356877130838498>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1929356877130838498</a>]
But he now quoted the following paragraphs from the other paper:
[<a href=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115>https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These β-structured oligomers are able to grow further by
self-association or through the addition of monomers, often with further
and sometimes dramatic structural reorganizations, to form well-defined
fibrils with cross-β structure and a high level of structural order
(Figure 1). Alternatively, the disordered aggregates or native-like
aggregates can grow without any major structural conversion and give
rise to large amorphous deposits or native-like assemblies,
respectively, retaining the structure characterizing the initial
oligomers (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Such large aggregates, including amyloid, amorphous, or native-like
assemblies, have links with human disease as they accumulate in
well-defined pathological states. Tables 1 and 2 list the proteins and
the disorders that have now been identified to be associated with the
formation of amyloid fibrils or other types of aggregates, respectively.
(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 also list, for each protein, references
reporting the identification of the protein in the aggregates and the
characteristics of the aggregate type.) We have arranged both tables in
terms of proteins rather than disorders to stress the fact that many of
these proteins have been found to be involved in a variety of
pathological conditions. Interestingly, immunoglobulins or their
subunits are found in all the different types of protein aggregates,
including amyloid (as in light-chain amyloidosis), amorphous (as in
light-chain deposition disease), and native-like (as in Berger disease)
structures, thus representing a remarkable manifestation of the
multiplicity of pathways existing in protein aggregation and of the
structures and morphologies that can be generated (24-26). Those
proteins that form intracellular inclusions of types that are still
debated, such as TDP-43 and p53, are included in Table 2 with a footnote
explaining this uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I pointed out that Figure 1 illustrated typical nano-scale
amyloid fibrils. And Supplemental Table 1 characterized the shape of
various types of amyloid structures as <span
class="quote">"intrinsically disordered"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-intrinsically.webp width=660>
</div>
<p>Then McCairn posted his microscope photos and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're so retarded! This particular amyloid, is novel and not listed
because you're looking at science being done in real time.</p>
<p>The principles of misfolding though, are likely the mechanism leading
to the macroform and of course the species of protein undergoing change.
Fibrin is inherently primed to make macromolecular structures, hence the
amyloidogenic form is going to be larger.</p>
<p>Which is why I have gone to the effort of showing concordant
structure across scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I told him: <span class="quote">"Post-COVID clots are not relevant
to my question. You cited two pre-COVID papers to support a claim that
amyloid aggregates have <span class="quote">'scale-invariant
preservation of fibrillar architecture'</span> and they form <span
class="quote">'twisted ribbon-like or lamellar structures irrespective
of protein species'</span>."</span> And McCairn replied: <span
class="quote">"That's because there is no post-COVID manuscripts showing
the phenomenon, in the manner that I have, you're looking at it being
made right now, and disseminated to the public. It is usual in
scientific writing to point to key historical citations that demonstrate
concordance within hypothetical frameworks."</span> But he still didn't
answer my question, so I told him: <span class="quote">"We already know
you claim that baby calamari clots have a tendency to form into a
ribbon-like shape on the micrometer scale. The question was which part
of the sources you cited supports the claim that the same applies to
other types of amyloid formations."</span></p>
<p>But then McCairn said <span class="quote">"there is a coherency in
the epistemological grounding of the amyloid PRION formation"</span>, so
I told him that it sounded like great pseudo-profound bullshit:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929507781163524103>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1929507781163524103</a>]</p>

</div>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-pseudoprofound-2.jpg width=550>
</div>
<hr />
<p>A user on Twitter said that the string-like object in McCairn's
microscope image was too big to be an aggregate of amyloid protein, and
it looked like dust or debris. McCairn cited a paper by Pretorius and
Kell which said that <span class="quote">"the fibrinaloid microclots
that we observe are typically in the range 1-200 µm on their longest
axis"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1930402739089223987>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1930402739089223987</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-kell-microclotsize-1.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>However the text he quoted referred to this figure, which showed that
the microclots described by Pretorius and Kell did not have a
string-like shape:</p>

<hr />
<p>Added in June 2025: Children's Health Defense posted a video clip
where Suzanne Humphries said that when she looked at the contents of a
COVID vaccine vial under a microscope, she saw structures that look like
circles and squares, which transformed into structures that looked like
circuit boards:

that they apparently thought were related to the discovery by Humphries.
They included the chip-like structures found by people in Burkhardt's
conference, graphene disks found by Zandre Botha, and the mini clot that
Kevin McCairn supposedly found in the blood of a 3-year-old (but a
common denominator between Burkhardt, Botha, and McCairn is that they
have all done a laboratory analysis of the calamari clots):</p>

<p>The tweet about McCairn's amyloid fibril was posted by a user called
PinkBeachGirl1, which looks like a MAGA bot. It has posted almost
200,000 tweets:

<p>Added in June 2025: McCairn now did a stream where he looked at the
contents of a Moderna vaccine vial under a microscope. He saw this
fiber-like structure, and he said <span class="quote">"If I saw that in
blood, I'd be like, uh, that looks suspect"</span>:

<p>McCairn showed the fiber-like formations were also autofluorescent.
He said he didn't know what they were, but he said: <span
class="quote">"And the problem with there being bacterial contamination
- I don't know how much those fibrous mats are like bacterial hydrogels
in this instance."</span> [2:05:23] He also showed this fiber-like
structure in the Moderna vaccine that was stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-2.webp width=1100>

<p>He also showed this structure that he described as a filament, which
was also stained by Thioflavin T:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-modernafiber-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Therefore the fiber that McCairn found in the blood sample of the
3-year-old may have also been a false positive:

<p>Carrie Madej is also supposed to have found mysterious fibers in a
Moderna vaccine vial:

<p>This Twitter user also pointed out that amyloid fibrils are
nano-scale structures:

<hr />
<p>In 2022 McCairn did a video where he showed the microscope image by
David Nixon below, and he said: <span class="quote">"Everything that I
see here is cholesterol, and literal fibers that you pick up in dust in
the air. What I've seen these people do - they're not doing it in clean
rooms - and you've gotta be in exceptionally clean rooms to make sure
that slides are not getting contaminated. Sorry. You don't get to say
that these are graphene internet fiber optic cables."</span>

But if he saw the same image in 2025, he would probably declare that the
fiber is an amyloid fibril:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fiberoptic.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>McCairn's Substack post was titled <span class="quote">"Amyloidogenic
Fibrils in a Post-Gestational Case of mRNA Vaccine Exposure: Structural,
Pathophysiological, and Biosecurity Perspectives"</span>. So the title
didn't use the phrase <span class="quote">"amyloid fibril"</span>, which
refers to nanoscale structures, and in the post McCairn wrote that the
<span class="quote">"fibril"</span> he found was actually an amyloid
formation (even though he still confusingly used the word <span
class="quote">"fibril"</span> to refer to the formation). However
Nicolas Hulscher's tweet about the post said that McCairn found <span
class="quote">"amyloid fibrils"</span>: <span class="quote">"BREAKING:
Amyloid Fibrils Found in 3-Year-Old After In-Utero mRNA Injection

on McCairn's post, he also used the phrase <span class="quote">"amyloid
fibrils"</span> in the title: <span class="quote">"BREAKING: Prion-Like

His banner image for the post also included text that said <span

<p>The junk amplifier accounts SenseReceptor and toobaffled also wrote
that McCairn found <span class="quote">"amyloid fibrils"</span> in the

<p>McCairn linked to a ChatGPT conversation where he uploaded his images
of the mini calamari clot of the 3-year-old, and he asked if it
conformed to <span class="quote">"known amyloidogenic fibrillar forms of
fibrin"</span>.
[<a href=https://chatgpt.com/c/689ecab9-9ba0-8326-a605-6c1420ac3614>https://chatgpt.com/c/689ecab9-9ba0-8326-a605-6c1420ac3614</a>]
ChatGPT said the structure was a <span
class="quote">"macro-fibril"</span>: <span class="quote">"Native fibrin
typically exhibits 50-200 nm filament bundles; here we see a
<em>macro-fibril</em> several microns wide, suggesting lateral fusion of
many protofibrils into a ribbon-like band - a known amyloid fibrin
phenotype."</span> It also said: <span class="quote">"This shifts the
interpretation from <span class="quote">'probable'</span> to <span
class="quote">'confirmed presence'</span> of β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrin
macrofibrils."</span></p>
<p>The diameter of the 3-year-old's clot was about 10-20 µm based on the
scale bar in the SEM image. When I asked ChatGPT what the diameter of
amyloid macrofibrils was, it said the diameter was typically on the
nanometer scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amyloid <strong>macrofibrils</strong> are higher-order bundles of
smaller amyloid fibrils. Their diameter depends on both the protein type
and the aggregation environment, but in published measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single amyloid fibrils</strong>: ~6-12 nm diameter (core
β-sheet cross-section)</li>
<li><strong>Protofibrils</strong>: ~2-5 nm (precursors before mature
fibril)</li>
<li><strong>Macrofibrils</strong>: typically <strong>50-200 nm</strong>,
but sometimes up to <strong>500 nm</strong> in thick bundles seen in
plaques or clot-associated aggregates</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alzheimer's Aβ plaques: macrofibrils often 80-150 nm</li>
<li>Serum amyloid A (AA amyloidosis): bundles 50-200 nm</li>
<li>Amyloid-rich fibrin(ogen) clots: ribbon-like macrofibrils up to a
few hundred nm wide, occasionally merging into micron-scale sheets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In his Substack post McCairn also wrote that the mini clot was a
<span class="quote">"macro-fibrillar form"</span>.

I bet if Ana was told you can't see a carbon nanotube with an optical
microscope, she would say it was a carbon macronanotube.</p>
<p>Youngmi Lee also said that the spiral-like structure on the right was
a <span class="quote">"macronanobot"</span>, even though it was visible
with an optical microscope. She said: <span class="quote">"Macronanobot!

<p>Here's a random microscope image of dust, where some fibers look flat
but others have a more cylindrical shape. Some fibers have the kind of
torn-looking ends as the fiber in Mr. Micronicle's photo:
[<a href=https://www.dreamstime.com/ordinary-house-dust-under-microscope-microscopic-world-image261465832>https://www.dreamstime.com/ordinary-house-dust-under-microscope-microscopic-world-image261465832</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-dust-microscope.jpg width=500>
</div>
<hr />
<p>In his second Substack post McCairn posted optical microscope photos
of a fiber that he supposedly found in the blood of a 3-year-old. He
indicated that he was next going to run SEM, EDX, and Raman on the
sample: <span class="quote">"Guardians were explicitly briefed on the
scope and purpose of data collection, the nature of imaging techniques
employed (including UV fluorescence microscopy, Thioflavin T staining,
preservation for SEM/EDX analysis, and Raman Spectroscopy), and how the
data would be analyzed and disclosed."</span>
[<a href=https://substack.com/&#x40;kevinwmccairnphd282302/p-164383206>https://substack.com/@kevinwmccairnphd282302/p-164383206</a>]
He also wrote: <span class="quote">"A total of 31 micrographs were
generated from one glass slide sample. The majority were imaged using
autofluorescence under UV excitation only to avoid chemical interference
and preserve structural integrity for scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, and Raman
Spectroscopy."</span></p>
<p>However in his third Substack post McCairn only posted SEM images of
the sample, but he didn't describe the results of EDX or Raman analysis.
When I asked him if he had been able to determine if the fiber was made
on fibrin, he didn't answer me, and when I asked if he had done SEM or
Raman, he only said the sample was on a glass slide so he couldn't do
Raman, but he might later attempt to transfer the sample to a quartz
slide to do Raman:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961313482810237159>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961313482810237159</a>]</p>

<p>A month earlier McCairn told me that he was still working on the
samples, but that <span class="quote">"For the moment, they remain ThT
and phenotypically positive"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1945485401994502492>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1945485401994502492</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-falsepositive.webp width=550>

<p>So I asked him if he had now run additional tests on the sample to
determine if the fiber was fibrin or not, but he indicated he hadn't
done additional testing and he hadn't confirmed that the fiber was
fibrin:

<p>McCairn responded to my tweets by doing a stream where he said that
he had in fact done EDX on the 3-year-old's fiber, but I don't know why
he never answered when I asked him several times on Twitter if he had
done EDX. He showed the image below, and he said: <span
class="quote">"What do we see when we look at Baby B with SEM/EDX? So -
high-level focusing - carbon and oxygen, silicon is the glass-slide.
Chlorine, whatever, I'd say that's salt from the saline in the blood and
the dye I've dropped on it. Here we can see the elemental
signatures."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-edx.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next he showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"And
there's the Raman signature that we have for it. And, um, carbon,
chlorine - there's other ones not labeled here, but there's oxygen,
phosphorus, [unintelligible]. What I would expect to see. And it's
normal elemental signature"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-edx-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I don't know why he said his plot showed a Raman signature, because
he showed an EDX spectrum plot. Grok said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plot in the image appears to be an Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectrum, not a Raman spectrum, based on its axes (energy in keV on the
x-axis, which is characteristic of X-ray spectroscopy for elemental
analysis, rather than Raman shift in cm⁻¹). Describing it as a <span
class="quote">"Raman signature"</span> could stem from a few
possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misnomer or confusion between techniques:</strong> Raman
spectroscopy and EDX are both used in materials characterization to
produce <span class="quote">"spectral signatures"</span> (unique peak
patterns that act like fingerprints for identification). Someone
unfamiliar with the specifics might interchangeably use <span
class="quote">"Raman"</span> as a generic term for any spectroscopic
plot, especially if they've encountered Raman more often in biological
or chemical contexts (e.g., analyzing biomolecules like proteins in
clots). Raman is popular for non-destructive molecular analysis, while
EDX is for elemental composition, but the visual similarity of peaked
spectra could lead to this slip.</li>
<li>[... etc ...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Next McCairn showed the SEM image below, where he said that the
3-year-old's fiber was <span class="quote">"connected to these
microclots at either end"</span>, even though the string doesn't even
look like it's connected to the blobs at the end, and I don't know how
McCairn was able to determine that the blobs were microclots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-connected-microclots.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next at time 2:22:15 McCairn said: <span class="quote">"One of these
exchanges you have - I've had to have - with henjin - is what I call
phenotypically similar or different. So does it have the features that I
would expect to see from canonical microclots - like, examples - let's
see if I find a quick example of microclots from someone else. So this
is a microclots from a Moderna-injured blood sample, taken in the
laboratory, and basically showing the same ribbon-like and twisting
features."</span> And he showed this image:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The ribbon he showed was flat and it had a lengthwise fold running
along the middle, so it lookde different from the other fibers he has
shown, which have had a more cylindrical shape so they looked like
strings or twigs, and which didn't have the lengthwise fold. However in
terms of the diameter, the flat fiber is still consistent with other
fibers that McCairn has presented as fibrin clots, because the fiber is
about 15 µm wide if the scale bar is accurate. But McCairn hasn't
presented a sufficient explanation for why some of his fibers have the
lengthwise fold but others don't.</p>
<p>Next McCairn showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"To
me - like I wanna say - are they connected? Or are they aggregating
together around the same - the same structure."</span> And he pointed to
the blob at the top and said: <span class="quote">"And then there's this
clot up here, which isn't too visible until you do the Thioflavin
staining, and then you see this sort of cluster."</span> But I think the
blobs don't look connected at all to the string:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next he again showed the SEM image and said: <span class="quote">"You
can kind of see with the electron microscopy there's like a shadow
between them. And are they connected, right, together? Are they apart of
the same structure. And where you have these tools, the light gray - the
background changes right here, right. This is where you need the
sensitivity signals."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Next as an example of what he meant by phenotypic similarity, he
showed the image below, and he said: <span class="quote">"Here, where
you see this twisting - which is what amyloids do - when you look at the
sort of computer modeling of them, there's a sort of limit to the width
that they can take. And they can braid to some extent, right, so they're
not like a molecule thick. So they're able to sort of aggregate together
and make a twisting braid."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-phenotypic-ribbon-4.jpg width=450>
</div>
<p>Earlier McCairn said that in his SEM image with a 5,000-fold
magnification level, the reason why large <span class="quote">"main
branch"</span> in the structure looked twisted was because of protein
misfolding.
[<a href=clot.html#Kevin_McCairns_scanning_electron_microscope_images_of_fibrin_clots>clot.html#Kevin_McCairns_scanning_electron_microscope_images_of_fibrin_clots</a>]
But the branch was about 3 µm wide, and individual fibrils of fibrin are
only about 0.1 µm wide, so even if the individual fibrils would have a
twisted shape, the aggregate structure wouldn't necessarily also look
twisted. But now McCairn seems to say that a similar twisted shape is
characteristic of even larger fibers that are visible to the naked
eye.</p>
<p>When I asked McCairn on Twitter if he had done Raman spectroscopy on
the 3-year-old's fiber, he said he couldn't do Raman on the sample
because it was on a glass slide, but he needed a quartz slide to do
Raman. So I asked him if he couldn't have asked for another sample of
blood on a quartz slide, but in his stream he now answered me: <span
class="quote">"His sample was very very precious, right. One, it's from
a 3-year-old child. You do not want to go doing interventions on a child
unnecessarily. Unfortunately for that child, he has had many
interventions medically because of the condition he's in."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6yarfu-schizoid-spiral-saturday-the-henjin-files.html?start=6876>https://rumble.com/v6yarfu-schizoid-spiral-saturday-the-henjin-files.html?start=6876</a>]
But it sounds like a fake excuse, and I don't think it would've been too
much of a major intervention to prick the boy's finger for a second
time. McCairn also said: <span class="quote">"What the guardians of Baby
B asked was that if I find something, make that something
public."</span> But wouldn't the parents of the child also have wanted
to make sure that McCairn didn't misidentify the fibers in the blood?
And would they have wanted Frank Bergman to issue a red alert and claim
the fiber was a <span class="quote">"fibrous clot"</span>, if it was
actually a textile fiber from dust?</p>
<hr />
<p>So McCairn's evidence that his fibers are made of amyloid fibrin seem
to mainly consist of positivity by ThT staining, autofluoresence under
UV light, and <span class="quote">"phenotypic similarity"</span> (which
includes a twisted shape, and being embedded in the sample of blood and
not resting on top of the dried blood).</p>
<p>ChatGPT said there are many reasons why ThT staining might result in
a false positive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>False positives can occur because ThT is not perfectly specific for
amyloid structures. Some potential causes include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Non-amyloid β-sheet-rich proteins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proteins with extensive β-sheet secondary structure but not in an
amyloid state may still bind ThT and fluoresce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydrophobic or aromatic interactions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ThT can intercalate into other hydrophobic environments or interact
with aromatic residues, giving fluorescence unrelated to amyloid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High dye concentration (self-aggregation)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At excessive concentrations, ThT can self-associate and produce
background fluorescence, mimicking positive signal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-specific binding to cellular components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lipid membranes, nucleic acids, or other macromolecular assemblies
may trap ThT, leading to signal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fluorescent contaminants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Autofluorescence from tissue components, fixation artifacts, or
other dyes used in the same sample may overlap with ThT's emission
spectrum.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Improper excitation/emission filter settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suboptimal microscopy or spectrophotometer settings can register
spurious signals as "positive."</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>However some of McCairn's fibers have been strongly autofluorescent
even without the ThT staining.</p>
<p>I also asked ChatGPT: <span class="quote">"If a microscopic fiber in
a blood sample is autofluorescent under UV, is it a fiber made of
amyloid fibrin? What other types of fiber could it be?"</span> It
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Autofluorescence of a microscopic fiber under UV light <strong>does
not by itself prove</strong> that the fiber is composed of amyloid
fibrin. Amyloid fibrin has characteristic β-sheet structures that can be
stained by dyes such as Thioflavin T (ThT) or Congo Red, but simple
autofluorescence is a very nonspecific property. Many biological and
non-biological fibers fluoresce under UV.</p>
<h3 id="why-autofluorescence-alone-is-not-sufficient">Why
autofluorescence alone is not sufficient:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrin</strong>: Can fluoresce when bound to
specific dyes (e.g., ThT), but native fibrin fibers are generally weakly
fluorescent under UV unless amyloid-like conformations or bound
chromophores are present.</li>
<li><strong>UV excitation</strong> excites a wide range of molecules
(aromatic amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine; NADH;
flavins; porphyrins), so many biological structures emit
autofluorescence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-possible-types-of-fibers-in-blood-samples">Other possible
types of fibers in blood samples:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fibrin/fibrinogen fibers</strong> - Normal clotting fibers
may appear fibrous and can have weak intrinsic fluorescence.</li>
<li><strong>Collagen or elastin fragments</strong> - Both are
autofluorescent due to their cross-link structures and aromatic
residues.</li>
<li><strong>Cellular debris</strong> - Cytoskeletal proteins (actin,
tubulin, keratin) can form fibrous remnants and show fluorescence.</li>
<li><strong>Extracellular DNA/protein complexes (NETs)</strong> -
Neutrophil extracellular traps form fibrous webs containing DNA and
histones, which fluoresce strongly under UV.</li>
<li><strong>Contaminants</strong> - Textile fibers (cotton, polyester,
nylon) or dust particles are common in microscopic preparations and many
fluoresce brightly under UV.</li>
<li><strong>Other protein aggregates</strong> - Non-amyloid aggregates
rich in β-sheets may bind nonspecifically to fluorescent molecules or
show weak autofluorescence.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>ChatGPT told McCairn that the EDX results of the 3-year-old's fiber
were not consistent with cellulose or synthetic fibers:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1962276133325635890>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1962276133325635890</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyedx.webp width=650>
</div>
<p>He also asked ChatGPT to analyze his confocal microscopy results:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyedx-2.webp width=650>
</div>
<p>However it's still suspicious that earlier I asked McCairn at least 5
times if he had done EDX on the sample, and if so then why he hadn't
reported the results, but he never answered me.
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961313482810237159>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961313482810237159</a>,

<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961533518137155748>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961533518137155748</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961693800889217445>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961693800889217445</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961881494114173092>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1961881494114173092</a>]
So one possible scenario is that he spoofed the EDX results as a
response to me.</p>
<p>I also asked him multiple times which tests he had done on the
sample, but he didn't say anything about having done confocal
microscopy. And I don't remember him having presented either the EDX or
confocal microscopy results earlier, even though I haven't seen all of
his streams so I might have missed it.</p>
<p>It's possible that his EDX results are real, and his fiber is made of
human protein, but even then the protein might not necessarily be
fibrin. I think McCairn has still not provided sufficient evidence that
the fibers he finds are actually made of fibrin.</p>
<p>McCairn said on Twitter that <span class="quote">"I do EDX as
standard when using the machine"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1962253654590918916>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1962253654590918916</a>]
The SEM and EDX results he showed were combined into a single PDF file
of output, so I guess when he went to the lab to do SEM, he might have
done EDX at the same time. But then I don't understand why he didn't say
he had done EDX even though I asked it at least 5 times.</p>
<p>I don't even know any other person besides McCairn who claims to have
found string-like fibers of fibrin in human blood. The images of
microclots from Pretorius and Kell don't appear to have a string-like
shape. If string-like clots of fibrin are now ubiquituous in human blood
because of COVID vaccines, and McCairn has found them in several samples
of blood from random people, then it shouldn't be too difficult for
other people to find the fibers. So therefore I would like to see
McCairn's findings verified by some neutral person who is not part of
the anti-vaccine movement, and who is not the host of a conspiracy video
show. McCairn is especially suspect as a source because of his
connection to Greg Harrison, who I have busted producing blatant
disinformation about the clots.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I asked McCairn if he had taken SEM images of the 3-year-old's
sample at a higher magnification, he posted this image at a 5,000-fold
magnification:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964615823949267279>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964615823949267279</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I didn't find any region in the lower-magnification images that
looked similar to the new image at 5,000-fold magnification. McCairn
told me the new image was supposed to show a part of the 3-year-old's
fiber, but he refused to say which part it was:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964657152897024470>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964657152897024470</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>McCairn wasn't even able to answer what part of the 5000x image
showed the fiber and what part showed the background:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964682263737802949>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1964682263737802949</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-5000x-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<hr />
<p>The cotton fiber in this image has the same type of torsion as the
3-year-old's fiber, which McCairn claimed was a characteristic of
amyloid fibrin microclots:
[<a href=https://tricliniclabs.com/reference-material/downloadable-documents/APPLICATION_NOTE-CONTAMINANT-IR-FIBROUS-ID-MAY-2023.pdf>https://tricliniclabs.com/reference-material/downloadable-documents/APPLICATION_NOTE-CONTAMINANT-IR-FIBROUS-ID-MAY-2023.pdf</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-sem-fiber-materials.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In fact the 3-year-old's fiber is consistent with a cotton fiber in
terms of its diameter, flatness, and the torsion. Cotton fibers are also
flat, and their diameter is typically about 12-25 µm:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cotton-fiber-comparison.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT to list morphological characteristics of cotton
fibers, one of the features it listed were the twists that are called
<span class="quote">"convolutions"</span> in cotton:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape</strong>: Each fiber is a flattened, twisted, and
ribbon-like structure. The twists, called <em>convolutions</em>, are a
distinguishing feature of cotton.</li>
<li><strong>Length</strong>: Fibers are relatively long compared to
other natural cellulosic fibers. Depending on species and variety, they
range from about <strong>10 mm to 60 mm</strong>, with commercial cotton
typically between <strong>20-40 mm</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Diameter</strong>: The width of a fiber is usually
<strong>12-25 micrometers</strong>, tapering towards the tip.</li>
<li><strong>Surface</strong>: The outer wall is smooth but shows
irregular twists along its length.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-section</strong>: The fiber cross-section is generally
kidney-shaped or oval with a hollow center (<em>lumen</em>). The lumen
collapses as the fiber matures, contributing to its twisted form.</li>
<li><strong>Fineness</strong>: Cotton fibers are relatively fine, which
contributes to softness and comfort in textiles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also said that cotton might take up ThT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, cotton fiber can take up <strong>Thioflavin T (ThT)</strong>,
but the mechanism and extent depend on the fiber's structure and the
experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cotton composition</strong>: Cotton is almost entirely
cellulose (a β-1,4-linked glucan). Unlike amyloid fibrils (the classical
ThT target), cellulose does not present the same β-sheet supramolecular
structure, but it does form extended hydrogen-bonded networks.</li>
<li><strong>ThT binding</strong>: ThT is a benzothiazole dye with
cationic character. It tends to bind in hydrophobic grooves or along
aligned β-sheet surfaces. While cellulose does not provide the same
binding mode, ThT can still interact through:
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrostatic attraction</strong> with hydroxyl groups
(though weaker than protein amyloids).</li>
<li><strong>Hydrophobic stacking</strong> within ordered cellulose
fibrils and crystalline regions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fluorescence response</strong>: The characteristic strong
fluorescence enhancement of ThT is specific to amyloid fibrils. In
cotton, uptake may occur, but the dye is unlikely to show the same high
fluorescence signal because the rigid binding pockets that restrict
ThT's rotational freedom are absent.</li>
<li><strong>Practical use</strong>: Textile chemistry research shows
that cotton readily adsorbs many cationic dyes (including
benzothiazoles), especially if the fiber is pretreated (e.g.,
mercerization). Thus, cotton can <span class="quote">"take up"</span>
ThT, but it may behave more like a normal textile dye rather than a
selective amyloid probe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's another image that shows how a distinguishing feature of
cotton fibers are the twists that are called <span
class="quote">"convolutions"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fiber-types.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>McCairn might also do a similar side-by-side comparison where he
would show microscope images of different types of fibers next to his
supposed microclots.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn posted these microscope images of cotton fibers:
[<a href=https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964863856054051121>https://x.com/KevinMcCairnPhD/status/1964863856054051121</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-mccairn-cotton.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>In the second tweet, the two images on the top row show the
3-year-old's fiber and the two images on the bottom row shows cotton
fibers.</p>
<p>I pointed out to McCairn that his images of the 3-year-old's fiber
were taken at such low magnification that it was not easy to tell if the
fiber had lengthwise striations. You can't even see it from the 200x SEM
image, and the 5000x SEM image doesn't show any part of the fiber as far
as I can tell.</p>
<p>For example this cotton fiber looks fairly smooth, and the striations
are so subtle that they would not necessarily be visible at 10-fold
magnification with an optical microscope:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-cotton-striation.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Also part of the difference in appearance between the fibers might
have been due to differences in dying, ThT staining, or other
properties. For example often white or neon-colored clothes are more
strongly fluorescent under UV light than black clothes. ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural, undyed cotton is not strongly fluorescent under ultraviolet
(UV) light, although it can exhibit a faint blue-white fluorescence due
to trace impurities such as residual waxes or processing agents. Raw or
unbleached cotton typically shows a dull yellowish or weak blue
fluorescence caused by natural pigments like pectin and
xanthophylls.</p>
<p>Bleached white cotton, on the other hand, often fluoresces brightly
with a blue-white glow because optical brightening agents (OBAs) are
commonly added during the bleaching process. These agents absorb UV
radiation and re-emit it in the blue region of the visible spectrum,
enhancing the perceived whiteness of the fabric.</p>
<p>Dyed cotton exhibits highly variable fluorescence depending on the
dye used. Many dyes suppress or quench fluorescence, while certain
fluorescent dyes, such as those based on rhodamine or fluorescein, can
produce vivid colors under UV illumination.</p>
<p>Cotton treated with optical brighteners through laundry detergents
also displays a strong bluish-white fluorescence, similar to that seen
in commercially bleached fabrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, a white cotton fiber typically appears strongly fluorescent
under a UV microscope, but the intensity depends on how the fiber was
processed.</p>
<p>In most modern white cotton fabrics, optical brightening agents
(OBAs) are applied during bleaching or finishing. These compounds absorb
ultraviolet radiation (usually in the 340-380 nm range) and re-emit blue
light (around 420-450 nm). Under a UV microscope, such fibers appear
with a bright blue-white fluorescence, often much more intense than that
of untreated natural fibers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next image shows a fiber that McCairn supposedly found in the
3-year-old's blood. The fiber is fluorescent under UV light even without
ThT staining, so I don't know if the fiber might for example be a white
fiber of cotton:
[<a href=https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrin-microclotting>https://kevinwmccairnphd282302.substack.com/p/amyloidogenic-fibrin-microclotting</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-autofluorescent.webp width=450>
</div>
<hr />
<p>When McCairn asks his followers to do a finger prick sample and send
a small drop of blood to him in the mail, he supposedly finds fibrin
clots with a diameter of about 10-30 µm in a large fraction of the
samples. So if the density of clots in his samples is representative of
the overall density of the clots in the bloodstream, then are there
thousands of clots circulating in the bloodstream indefinitely, so that
once they reach the arterial capillaries, they pass through the
capillary bed to the veins, go back to the heart, and go back to
arteries again? And if the clots are somehow induced by vaccines, then
how do they remain in circulation even years after vaccination?</p>
<p>ChatGPT said that a clot with a diameter of 20 µm wouldn't pass
through the capillaries, which have a diameter of only about 5-10 µm:
[<a href=https://chatgpt.com/share/68bec722-9864-8000-a1c8-d1a5206f4923>https://chatgpt.com/share/68bec722-9864-8000-a1c8-d1a5206f4923</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No - a fibrin clot of the size you described (<strong>20 µm in
diameter × 1 mm in length</strong>) could not <span
class="quote">"loop"</span> repeatedly through the circulation. Here's
why:</p>
<p><strong>1. Size relative to vessels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capillaries</strong>: ~5-10 µm in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Your clot</strong>: 20 µm in diameter, twice as wide as the
largest capillaries.</li>
<li>Red blood cells deform to pass; fibrin clots cannot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, such a structure <strong>cannot traverse
capillaries</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Artery-to-vein transfer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For blood to move from the arterial side to the venous side, it must
pass through the <strong>capillary bed</strong>.</li>
<li>Since the clot is wider than capillaries, it would become
<strong>trapped at the first capillary network it
encounters</strong>.</li>
<li>It would not emerge on the venous side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Circulatory "loops"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only cells and small deformable particles (RBCs, WBCs, platelets)
can continuously recirculate.</li>
<li>Solid emboli (clots, cholesterol crystals, etc.) either:</li>
<li><strong>Lodge in a vessel</strong> (causing occlusion), or</li>
<li><strong>Fragment into smaller pieces</strong> until they are small
enough to pass further downstream.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The capillaries at the tip of a finger have a diameter of about 5-10
µm, so I was wondering if they wouldn't be too narrow for McCairn's
fibers to pass through, so that the fibers could end up in a finger
prick sample:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1965068669672997217>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1965068669672997217</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-wide-finger-prick.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>But then I figured out that the finger prick lancet might reach deep
enough to penetrate the arterioles and not only the capillaries. ChatGPT
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capillaries in the fingertip are far smaller than a 20 µm clot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical capillary lumen diameter:</strong> ~5-10 µm, often
just wide enough for a single red blood cell (≈7-8 µm) to deform and
pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Precapillary arterioles / postcapillary venules:</strong>
somewhat larger (≈10-30 µm), but true capillaries in the papillary
dermis are in the 5-8 µm range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>20 µm fibrin clot would not be able to traverse
capillaries</strong>; it is roughly 3-4× larger than the lumen.</li>
<li>However, if such a microclot were already present in a
<strong>postcapillary venule or small arteriole</strong> in the dermal
plexus (where diameters can be &gt;20 µm), it could potentially be
carried into the superficial circulation and then extravasated through a
lancet puncture.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said that the arterioles start at a depth of about 0.3-0.6 mm
beneath the surface of the fingertips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fingertip, the vascular network is stratified. Based on
microanatomical and histological studies of digital pulp and nail-bed
skin:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capillary loops</strong>: extend into dermal papillae
immediately beneath the epidermis, beginning at <strong>~50-150 µm below
the skin surface</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Superficial dermal plexus</strong>: composed of arterioles
and venules, located in the upper dermis at a depth of roughly
<strong>0.3-0.6 mm</strong> beneath the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper dermal/subpapillary arterioles</strong> (arising from
the deep plexus): usually found at <strong>~1-2 mm depth</strong> at the
dermal-subcutaneous junction.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>arterioles that feed the capillary loops near the
fingertip start around 0.3-0.6 mm beneath the epidermis</strong>, while
larger supply arterioles run deeper, closer to 1-2 mm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ChatGPT said that a standard finger prick lancet typically
reaches a depth of about 1.5-2.0 mm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial fingerstick lancets are designed to puncture only into the
superficial dermis, deep enough to reach the <strong>superficial dermal
plexus</strong> but not so deep as to injure nerves or larger vessels.
Depth depends on device type and setting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shallow safety lancets (neonatal or glucose
monitoring):</strong> ~0.85-1.2 mm</li>
<li><strong>Standard adult fingerstick lancets:</strong> typically
<strong>1.5-2.0 mm</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deeper lancets (some adjustable models):</strong> up to
<strong>2.5-3.0 mm</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess feasibly a blood clot might get stuck in arterioles
because it can't pass through the arterial capillaries, and then it
might get released if you do a finger prick that reaches the arterioles.
So it wouldn't necessarily be anomalous if a clot is too big to pass
through the capillaries, if in fact the clot was not circulating freely
in blood, but it was stuck before the arterial capillaries in the
fingertip.</p>
<p>But regardless, I consider it unlikely that the fibers McCairn finds
in his blood samples are blood clots, and so far McCairn has not even
been able to show that his fibers are made of fibrin.</p>
<hr />
<p>McCairn now also posted the image below and wrote: <span
class="quote">"I've found a more clear image of the linear clot, but
it's at a lower 4000X, the 5000x are all noisy. The reason for looking
at high mag is to dispel the notion that it's cotton which shows
pronounced linear striations. It's clear in this sample that the surface
is dimpled, non-striated, and has nodules consistent with other
amyloidogenic clots."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The fiber above has a dent in the middle that is characteristic of
fibers of cotton, which develop a cupped or kidney-like shape after the
hollow center of the fiber collapses, but in some cases the fiber will
look more like a cylinder with a dent running along the middle
lengthwise, like in the image above.</p>
<p>I told McCairn that the image above was so blurry that subtle
striations might be hard to see. But then McCairn pointed out that the
fiber also had <span class="quote">"protruding nodule/nucleation
sites"</span>, which I think meant the small ball-like specks that were
attached to the fiber:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x-2.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>Then I posted a microscope image of dust which included fibers with
specks attached to the fibers, and I asked McCairn if his <span
class="quote">"nodules"</span> or <span class="quote">"nulecation
sites"</span> were just specks of dust. But he said it was unlikely
because his fiber had been soaked in buffer and dye:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-babyb-4000x-3.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>I pointed out it would be easy to do an experiment where you took a
sample of dust that contained fibers with specks attached, you soaked
the sample in buffer and ThT, and checked if the specks remained
attached to the fibers. And I posted this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, dust specks could remain adhered to a microscopic fiber even if
the fiber has been soaked in buffer and ThT, but the likelihood depends
on several factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Nature of the Fiber Surface</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the fiber is hydrophilic (e.g., cellulose or proteinaceous
material), buffer and ThT will wet it well, which can loosen loosely
attached dust particles.</li>
<li>If it is hydrophobic (e.g., certain synthetic polymers), surface
tension effects may cause dust specks to stay trapped.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dust Particle Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dust is heterogeneous: it can include inorganic particles, organic
matter, fibers, salts, and lipids. Some of these bind electrostatically
or hydrophobically to surfaces and are not easily washed off.</li>
<li>Small particles (&lt;1 µm) may adhere strongly through van der Waals
forces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Buffer and ThT Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aqueous buffer itself usually does not solubilize dust (unless the
dust contains salts).</li>
<li>Thioflavin T (ThT) is a small, charged, aromatic dye. At the
concentrations typically used, it does not act as a detergent, so it
won't remove particles strongly bound to the fiber.</li>
<li>ThT may even interact with hydrophobic dust or fibrous debris,
leading to retention rather than removal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanical Handling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Passive soaking is often insufficient to dislodge strongly adhered
dust.</li>
<li>Agitation, sonication, or filtration would be more effective.</li>
</ul></li>

When she said she saw Morgellons filaments in Hirschman's clots,
Hirschman told her: <span class="quote">"I had a live blood analysis of
my own blood, and my blood had some of those filaments in it

embalmed blood she received from Hirschman, which she said contained
Morgellons filaments, self-creating spheres, and blinking lights that
constructed ribbons out of hydrogel. But I haven't seen Hirschman
disavow Mihalcea's claims anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>La Quinta Columna:</strong> I have found no reference to

In 2024 IJVTPR published a paper which said there was nanotechnology in
COVID vaccines because the vaccines contained a high level of
lanthanides, and later a response to criticism of the paper was
published by 6 editors of IJVTPR, who included Santiago, Oller, and

By looking at the supplementary data in another paper, Quay found three
20 aa segments that overlapped with Pradhan's first three so-called HIV
inserts, and that had a high fibrinogen binding affinity. But Quay
presented the results in a misleading way, and he didn't show that more
than half of the NTD was covered by 20 aa segments that had the same or
higher fibrinogen binding affinity as the three segments he
highlighted.</p></li>

<p>In June 2025 Nicolas Hulscher posted a tweet where he promoted
McCairn's Substack post about the 3-year-old's fiber. The image included
in Hulscher's tweet said that the fiber was an <span

amyloid fibril:

<p>Two weeks earlier Hulscher interviewed Greg Harrison and Richard
Hirschman about the calamari clots. McCairn told me he had informed
Hirschman about how Greg was a scammer, but for some reason Hirschman
still keps touring the alt media circus with Greg:

<p>Accounts related to TWC seem to be artificially amplified by bots on
Twitter. In 2024 I scraped the reposts of about 80 accounts that I
suspected to be bots that promoted content about COVID from the
controlled alternative media. When I sorted accounts by the number of
reposts by suspected bots divided by the number of followers, and I
excluded accounts that were not related to COVID and accounts that had a
low number of followers, McCullough Foundation ranked second.
[<a href=bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers>bot2.html#Reposts_by_bots_compared_to_number_of_followers</a>]
The 4th highest ranking account was William Makis, who was a member of

<p>Makis promotes ivermectin and fenbendazole as miracle cures for turbo

A case study from 2011 described the case of a man who had earlier
thought he was poisoned by the Japanese mafia, but then he learned about
Morgellons disease from the internet so he started to think he had
Morgellons instead, so he bought ivermectin in bulk from a veterinary
supplier, and he ended up developing ivermectin toxicity.

<p>In 2024 Hulscher and McCullough coauthored a paper with Raphael
Stricker, who is possibly the main person responsible for popularizing
Morgellons disease. Stricker also coauthored another paper with
McCullough and Risch, who are both members of the TWC Chief Medical

<p>Stricker was a member of the advisory board of Morgellons Research
Foundation, which was founded by Mary Leitao who coined the term
Morgellons disease. Leitao's website featured these photos of Morgellons
filaments that she supposedly found from the blood of her 3-year-old
son, which are reminiscent of the mysterious fiber that McCairn found in
the blood of the 3-year-old boy:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-morgellons.jpg width=450>

<p>In 2019 the California Medical Board issued a complaint against
Stricker because he had prescribed ivermectin as a treatment for
Morgellons disease without obtaining informed consent.

an AIDS study, and afterwards he worked as an associate director of a
penis enlargement clinic.

<p>Ana Maria Mihalcea said that calamari clots are <span
class="quote">"made from these filaments that Clifford Carnicom calls
cross-domain bacteria or Morgellons filaments"</span>, and she showed
these images of Morgellons filaments that she found in Hirschman's
clots:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hulscher-mihalceafilaments.jpg width=500>

<p>Then Hirschman told Mihalcea <span class="quote">"I had a live blood
analysis of my own blood and my blood had some of those filaments in it
too"</span>, even though it's not clear if by the filaments he meant
Morgellons filaments or some other type of filaments. [55:26] Mihalcea
also showed a microscope video of blinking lights as evidence that
Hirschman's clots contained quantum dot microrobots, but Hirschman told
her <span class="quote">"you got some pretty daggum solid proof behind
you when you're showing the actual images, you're showing the blinking
lights"</span>. [1:00:57]</p>
<p>The only scientific paper about calamari clots I have found was
published in the journal IJVTPR. One of the people on the editorial
board of the journal is Shimon Yanowitz.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>]
Yanowitz said that the photo below showed a ribbon that he found in his
blood even though he was not vaccinated, so he may have been exposed to
the ribbon because of chemtrails or shedding by vaccinated people. He
said that the ribbon was possibly a Morgellons filament, and that it
looked very mean and it made red blood cells nervous. Shimon's ribbon
was about 2-3 red blood cells wide, which is similar to the diameter of
the fibers that McCairn says are fibrin microclots, and the fibers that
Mihalcea says are hydrogel filaments:

<p>The term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was first
introduced in September 2021 in Arne Burkhardt's pathology conference.
[<a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>] People in the conference said that
vaccines contained mini robots, graphene oxide, objects that looked like
SIM cards, and a parasite called <em>Treponasoma cruzi</em>. One person
in the conference showed this microscope image of vaccinated blood,
which she said showed synthetic fibers that may have consisted of
graphene, but another person suggested they were Morgellons filaments:

<p>In reality the fibers in the image above have several characteristics
of cotton, because they are about 2-3 blood cells wide, they have a flat
body with a cupped C-like shape, and they have the kind of lengthwise
twists that are called convolutions in fibers of cotton.</p>
<p>One of the people in McCairn's circle is Johanna Deinert. She worked
together with Arne Burkhardt, and I believe she even helped run his
website, which is rather suspicious considering how Burkhardt appears to
have been a Quinta Columna type plant in alt media.</p>

Morgellons is spread through chemtrails. He wrote that Morgellons
disease was the result of a <span class="quote">"adverse events in

to nanowires produced by genetically modified viruses (even though the
fibers that are said to be Morgellons filaments are visible with an
optical microscope, but nanowires are not).

<p>Finnegan was mentored by John Loftus, who wrote the foreword for his

used as source material in his book. Loftus is a former military
intelligence officer, Nazi hunter, and president of the Florida
Holocaust Museum.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loftus_%28military_author%29>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loftus_%28military_author%29</a>]
An old bio of Loftus said: <span class="quote">"As a young U.S. Army
officer, John Loftus helped train Israelis on a covert operation that
turned the tide of battle in the 1973 Yom Kippur War."</span>

Loftus claims that he is an Irish Catholic, but he even wrote a column
called <span class="quote">"Spyview"</span> for a Haredi Jewish magazine
called Ami.</p>
<p>Loftus wrote several books about how the US intelligence apparatus
was secretly controlled by the Nazis, including <span class="quote">"The
Belarus Secret"</span> and <span class="quote">"The War Against the
Jews"</span>. Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"The Office of Special

Vital Zayka, a fellow of the Center for Jewish History in New York City,
accused Loftus of
falsification.[<a href=http://nn.by/?c=ar&i=26162>7</a>] The Israeli
historian and Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff described the book as
controversial and referred to Charles R. Allen Jr.'s review in Jewish
Currents, in which Allen joined the active criticism of Loftus and named
him a fraud and a liar.[8]"</span>

<p>Loftus said that the publisher of his book <span class="quote">"The
Belarus Secret"</span> was a former high-level CIA agent who had a Q
clearance, and who taught him about the history of biowarfare.
[<a href=https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ly6eXrVXG3ORiKtN2mHjY>https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ly6eXrVXG3ORiKtN2mHjY</a>,
time 2:40] So if you trace back the mentorship chain, Finnegan was
taught about the history of biowarfare by a former military intelligence
agent, who was taught about the history of biowarfare by a former CIA
agent.</p>
<p>Loftus used to organize an annual intelligence conference called The
Intelligence Summit, whose advisory council included two former heads of
the CIA and senior officials of the Mossad.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligence_Summit>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligence_Summit</a>]
Another member of the advisory council was Paul E. Vallely, who was
Michael Aquino's commanding officer at the 7th PSYOP Group, and who
coauthored the article <span class="quote">"From PSYOP to
Mindwar"</span> with Aquino:

<p>The main financial sponsor of the conference was the Israeli gangster
Michael Cherney, who has been denied a visa to the United States since
1999 because of his involvement with the Russian Jewish mafia. In 1999
the Intepol issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney for
money laundering and organized crime.
[<a href=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3835491,00.html>https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3835491,00.html</a>,

His protege Oleg Deripaska was at one point the richest man in Russia.
Cherney organized a conference similar to Intelligence Summit in Israel,
which was called Jerusalem Summit.</p>
<p>Joel van der Reijden wrote this about Finnegan's mentor: <span
class="quote">"Other very obvious neocons - hardcore Zionists, in fact -
that have appeared on Coast to Coast AM are Robert Spencer and John
Loftus. Spencer runs the anti-Islamic outfit Jihad Watch and sits on the
advisory board of the Intelligence Summit. [...] Loftus is tied to the
highest levels of Israeli and Zionist political and intelligence
circles. Former CIA directors James Woolsey and John Deutch sat on the
board of his Intelligence Summit until 2006, when very obvious Russian
mafia ties to the Summit's long-term financier, Russian Zionist oligarch
Michael Cherney, were made public. Woolsey and Deutch should have known
about these ties, because since the late 1990s Cherney has been
repeatedly and convincingly linked to the powerful Russian-Zionist
Solntsevskaya mafia and its allies. These allies also include the
primary Rothschild partner in Russia, Oleg Deripaska, as well as the
Israeli state, which prevented a KGB/FSB-ran assassination against
Cherney in 1995. In 2003 Cherney also founded the Jerusalem Summit,
which sponsored at least two small meetings between Israeli officials
and American neocons. At the first meeting in 2003 Richard Perle and
Coast to Coast's Frank Gaffney were present, along with Ehud Olmert and
Benyamin Netanyahu. That's two visitors of Coast to Coast AM with clear
ties to Michael Cherney: John Loftus and Frank Gaffney. Basically,

<p>John Loftus was a frequent guest on the radio show of Dave Emory, who
is a leftist conspiracy theorist who finds Nazis hiding under every
rock.
[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aspitfirelist.com+loftus>https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aspitfirelist.com+loftus</a>]
In one of his old radio shows, Dave Emory said that the reason why all
the crooks appear to be Jews is because they're actually Nazis with fake
papers: <span class="quote">"But the main reason according to John
Loftus that the German government dragged its feet so dutifully in
releasing documents about the Third Reich - there was a large
documentation center in Berlin controlled by the German government, it
was the single largest repository of information about the Third Reich,
they only released it to journalists and historians a couple of years
ago, more than 60 years after the end World War II - and the main reason
for that according to John Loftus is that - as the Third Reich
operatives were preparing for their post-war underground careers, a
massive forging program was underway within the concentration camps
using forgers, who were basically a captive workforce to create very
elaborate paper trails documenting many of these post-war Third Reich
operatives as Jews. So that in addition to Bormann Jews <em>per se</em>,
there is also a substantive body of underground Reich slash Bormann
capital network operatives, who are basically nominally Jews, but are in
fact good loyal Nazis who have been given Jewish documentation. Again,
what a perfect cover for an underground operative of any kind, then - to
make oneself out to be the opposite of what one really is. So in
addition to the concept of Bormann Jews <em>per se</em>, bear in mind
that there was according to John Loftus a massive program to create a
Jewish cover for post-war operatives, and then rather like the financial
crisis, it can be blamed on - your negative things can be blamed on,
quote, <span class="quote">'the Jews'</span>."</span>

<p>One of the main topics Dave Emory discussed on his radio show was how
HIV was a bioweapon, and he also promoted the work of Len Horowitz and
Alan Cantwell, who both said that HIV was a bioweapon created by the
Americans.
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/For_The_Record_16_Interview_with_Leonard_Horowitz_Alan_Cantwell_Ed_Haslam_et_al/f-016a.mp3>https://archive.org/details/For_The_Record_16_Interview_with_Leonard_Horowitz_Alan_Cantwell_Ed_Haslam_et_al/f-016a.mp3</a>,

Alan Cantwell's protege St. Nick is part of McCairn's circle, and he has
archived old videos by Horowitz and Cantwell on McCairn's PeerTube site.
[<a href=https://t.wtyl.live/c/hiv_lab_origin/videos>https://t.wtyl.live/c/hiv_lab_origin/videos</a>]
Nick frequently also promotes Adam Finnegan, and he hosted a video panel
that featured Finnegan and McCairn's sidekick Charles Rixey.</p>
<p>Nick claims that HIV is a recombinant virus that includes components
of the Visna virus, which is a theory he copied from Alan Cantwell and
Robert Strecker. Nick was unable to answer me which parts of the genome
of HIV come from Visna, and I have shown him similarity plots which
demonstrate that no part of the genome of HIV is closer to Visna than to
SIV.
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754</a>]
Nick uses the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> to refer to
genetic recombination, so as evidence for his recombination hypothesis,
he keeps presenting a paper titled <span class="quote">"Visna
virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney cells"</span>, even
though the paper is about Visna-induced syncytium formation of host
cells, where the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> refers to host
cells merging together into a cell with multiple nuclei, and not to
recombination of two different species of viruses.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=syncytium+from:henjin256&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=syncytium+from:henjin256&amp;f=live</a>]
After I had called him out multiple times for presenting the paper as
evidence for his hypothesis but he still kept posting the paper, I said
that he seems to be deliberately producing disinformation, because at
that point he should've known himself that the paper had nothing to do
with his hypothesis, but he blocked me in response.</p>
<p>Len Horowitz was knighted by the Russian branch of the Knights of
Malta:

</div>
<p>His knighting is interesting considering how the Soviets launched a
disinformation campaign where they claimed that HIV was an American
bioweapon created at Fort Detrick. [<a href=hiv.html>hiv.html</a>] The
campaign was kicked off by an article by Valentin Zapevalov that was
published in 1985 in the Soviet journal <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>.
Zapevalov said that about 90% of the staff of the journal were Jews.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926203029/http://inforing.net/publications/infopress/culture.php?ELEMENT_ID=44648>https://web.archive.org/web/20200926203029/http://inforing.net/publications/infopress/culture.php?ELEMENT_ID=44648</a>]
Zapevalov later worked as a foreign correspondent for <em>Literaturnaya
Gazeta</em>, and he described his role as a foreign correspondent as
something between a diplomat and an intelligence officer.
[<a href=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич>https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич</a>]
The former Soviet counterintelligence agent Oleg Kalugin said that
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> was <span class="quote">"our prime conduit
in the Soviet press for propaganda and disinformation"</span>.
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQI5DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171>https://books.google.com/books?id=zQI5DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171</a>]
The Soviet story about HIV was promoted by the DC-based magazine
<em>CovertAction Information Bulletin</em>, whose main figurehead was
the former CIA agent Philip Agee, who communicated with the KGB through
the London correspondent of <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>.
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR41>https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR41</a>]
Out of the 8 people who were listed as founders of CAIB, 3 were former
CIA agents, at least 4 of the remaining 5 people were Jews, and the one
person I'm not sure of was married to one of the Jews.
[<a href=hiv.html#Selvage_and_Nehrings_2014_German_book>hiv.html#Selvage_and_Nehrings_2014_German_book</a>]
In 1992 the Stasi disinformation officer Günter Bohnsack admitted that
the story about HIV was part of a Stasi operation, but the three people
he credited for popularizing the story were Jakob Segal, Stephan Heym,
and Johannes Mario Simmel, who were all Jews.
[<a href=https://digitallibrary.tsu.ge/book/2019/september/books/Soviet-Bloc-Intelligence-and-Its-AIDS.pdf>https://digitallibrary.tsu.ge/book/2019/september/books/Soviet-Bloc-Intelligence-and-Its-AIDS.pdf</a>]
The main star of the campaign was the communist Jew Jakob Segal, who was
registered as a Stasi agent. He claimed that HIV was a recombination
product of STLV-I and the Visna virus. Segal's books were published by
the publishing house of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany. The
director of the publishing house coauthored a book with Segal, and who
went on a speaking tour in Africa promoting Segal's theory together with
the Communist Party of South Africa. Segal was interviewed in the West
German press by the Jewish journalist Stefan Heym, who was earlier the
editor-in-chief of the official German-language magazine of Communist
Party USA. Heym served in the US Army's psychological warfare unit
called the Ritchie Boys, which was led by the Jew Hans Habe, who
established numerous newspapers in Germany after the war when the German
press was dismantled. Bohnsack also said that the Stasi supplied
material about HIV to the Jewish fiction writer Johannes Mario Simmel,
who wrote a popular novel about the theory that HIV was created in Fort
Detrick.</p>
<p>The Soviet story about Fort Detrick is reminiscent of how George Webb
and Mark Kulacz suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was created in Fort Detrick by
Sina Bavari's team. Kulacz did his alt media debut on the channel of
John O'Loughlin, who is Finnegan's biggest advocate in alt media.
[<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380</a>]
George Webb also started promoting Adam Finnegan's book soon after the
book was published.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealgeorgewebb1+finnegan&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealgeorgewebb1+finnegan&amp;f=live</a>]
George Webb and Jason Goodman both speak fluent Russian according to
Steve Outtrim, and Jason Goodman was married to a Ukrainian.

<p>(But I don't know if these various Russian connections are relevant
to Finnegan, who actually says that Erich Traub was a Soviet agent. And
as of now I have a hard time deciding if Finnegan is deliberately
producing disinformation, or if he is just a useful idiot, even though
his connection to John Loftus is highly suspicious.)</p>

<p>The structures in the first two images are about 3-5 times wider than
the red blood cells, but red blood cells have a diameter of about 6-8
µm, so the width of the structures is roughly consistent with the fibers
McCairn has found in blood samples, which have had a diameter of about
10-30 µm.</p>
<p>One of McCairn's fibers was flat like the structures in the first two
images, but the others didn't look flat. But even McCairn's flat fiber
had a lengthwise fold in the middle, which was missing from the objects
shown in the images by Jesus4AllAlways. And none of McCairn's fibers
looked nearly as translucent as the objects in the first two images,
even though I don't know if it may have been due to a difference in
lighting or microscopy technique. And McCairn's fibers didn't have the
kind of folds of about 90 degrees as the first two images, where you can
see different parts of the folded structure overlapping each other.</p>
<p>So then why was McCairn ready to declare that the objects in the
images were <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic fibrin"</span>?</p>

<p>This is what ChatGPT said about Shimon's killer tube:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This image shows a <strong>ribbon-like structure under a
microscope</strong>, viewed with <strong>polarized light or differential
interference contrast (DIC)</strong>, based on the high-contrast,
crystalline-like edges. The object in question is highly consistent with
a <strong>synthetic microplastic fiber</strong>, most likely
<strong>polyester</strong>, <strong>nylon</strong>, or another
<strong>textile-derived filament</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-supporting-this">Characteristics Supporting
This:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flat, crumpled ribbon appearance</strong> typical of
synthetic fibers.</li>
<li><strong>High birefringence</strong> (bright glow under polarized
light), which is characteristic of plastics.</li>
<li><strong>No internal biological structure</strong> (e.g., no nuclei,
organelles, or cellular components).</li>
<li>The irregular folding and twisting are typical of how synthetic
fibers behave when dried or compressed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ana Mihalcea said that similar translucent ribbons with folds were
<span class="quote">"hydrogel filaments"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-hydrogelfilament.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT said that Mihalcea's hydrogel filaments were likely to be
synthetic fibers:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="left-image">Left Image:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The background consists of what look like <strong>red blood cells
(RBCs)</strong> - biconcave discs, tightly packed.</li>
<li>The ribbon runs diagonally and has a <strong>smooth,
semi-transparent</strong> appearance with <strong>light-scattering
properties</strong>, suggesting it is not biological tissue.</li>
<li>The ribbon's uniform thickness and reflective surface suggest it
could be a <strong>polymer fiber</strong>, perhaps from clothing or lab
materials (e.g., polyester or nylon).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="right-image">Right Image:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A similar structure is seen again, this time bent at an angle.</li>
<li>The <strong>bright refraction and internal stress patterns</strong>
visible under polarized or brightfield illumination are typical of
<strong>synthetic materials</strong>, not biological ones.</li>
<li>The presence of RBCs again near the ribbon supports that this is a
<strong>foreign object in a biological sample</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The ribbon in both images is most likely a <strong>synthetic
fiber</strong> accidentally introduced into the sample - possibly from
clothing, gloves, wipes, or sample coverslips. It is <strong>not a
biological structure</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly when I asked what the ribbon in the video by
Jesus4AllAlways was, ChatGPT answered: <span class="quote">"The
structure has sharp folds and flat surfaces, consistent with plastic
sheeting or synthetic ribbon fibers, not biological tissue."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Later I asked McCairn if he still stuck to his claim that the images
by Jesus4AllAlways showed <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibrin"</span>, and if by <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic
fibrin"</span> he referred to the flat ribbons with folds. He indicated
that he did refer to the flat ribbons with folds, and he said: <span
class="quote">"I would say from that image of that the ribbon like
structure is consistent with the morphology of amyloid fibrillar forms
seen in long covid and vax injured."</span>

<p>However I again uploaded Mihalcea's images of hydrogel filaments to
ChatGPT, and I asked if the folds and flat shape were consistent with a
fibrin clot. But ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No - sharp folds like the ones in your image (especially the ~90°
bend in the right-hand picture) are <strong>not characteristic of
natural fibrin clots</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrin mechanics</strong>: Natural fibrin fibers are
semi-flexible biopolymers. When bent, they curve smoothly because the
protofibril bundles resist sharp angles - you get arcs, not crisp
corners.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloid fibrin</strong>: Even when fibrin is converted into
amyloid-like β-sheet-rich forms, it becomes stiffer and more brittle,
but it still tends to fracture or kink irregularly rather than form a
neat, flat, ribbon-like corner.</li>
<li><strong>Your sample</strong>: The flat cross-section, uniform
thickness, and clean angular bend are far more consistent with synthetic
fibers (e.g., textile microfibers), which can hold a crease from
manufacturing or folding.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <strong>a true natural fibrin clot won't spontaneously
develop a paper-fold-style corner</strong> under physiological
conditions or during slide prep - unless it's being mechanically crushed
between coverslip and slide, in which case it fractures rather than
bends smoothly at 90°.</p>

<p>Kevin McCairn told me that the calamari clots <span
class="quote">"are very clearly blood vessel occlusions, composed of
amyloidogenic protein, that have the same properties as amyloidogenic
micro clots, that have been proven human tissue through genomic
testing"</span>.

<p>However I told him: <span class="quote">"A clump of fibrin is not
tissue. If you dipped some rubber in blood and tested it genetically,
you would find human DNA from the blood, but that doesn't mean the
rubber would be human tissue. It's possible the clots have a human
origin, but I think it has not yet been proven."</span> And I showed him
this response from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling such clots <span class="quote">"human tissue"</span> would be
misleading. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood clot composition:</strong> A fibrin-rich clot with
little entrapped blood cells is still just a coagulum of protein
(fibrin) rather than a structured tissue. It lacks organized cells,
extracellular matrix, vasculature, or architecture typical of
tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of tissue (in biology/medicine):</strong> Tissue
is a collection of cells (of one or more types) and their extracellular
products, organized to perform a function. Examples: epithelial tissue,
muscle tissue, connective tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Clot vs. tissue:</strong> A clot is an <strong>acellular
polymer network</strong> (fibrin mesh) that sometimes traps platelets,
leukocytes, and red blood cells. While it originates from blood (a fluid
connective tissue), a fibrin clot by itself is not equivalent to <span
class="quote">"human tissue."</span></li>
<li><strong>Terminology in practice:</strong> Pathologists or
hematologists would usually describe this as <span class="quote">"fibrin
clot,"</span> <span class="quote">"fibrinous exudate,"</span> or <span
class="quote">"thrombus"</span> (if formed in vivo), but not <span
class="quote">"tissue."</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>McCairn posted an AI response which said that the clots are not human
tissue, but the clots can be still viewed as a <span
class="quote">"quasi-tissue scaffold"</span>, or the clots can be
considered to <span class="quote">"function as novel pathological
pseudo-tissue"</span>:

<p>But I told him those were bad copes, and that he is a quasi-scientist

apart from tissue, or a peptide apart from a protein, or a micrometer

<p>I told McCairn I hadn't found evidence that string-like fibrin clots

<p>ChatGPT said that various types of fibers that appear as contaminants

matches the diameter of the fibers that McCairn has found in blood

<p>The next photo supposedly shows hydrogel filaments that Mihalcea

to Clifford Carnicom's photos of Morgellons filaments</a>
</h2>
<p>Clifford Carnicom's website has an archive of posts going back to
1999. His early posts focused on topics like chemtrails and HAARP, but
his first post about Morgellons disease was from 2006.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101224551/http:/www.carnicominstitute.org/html/articles_by_date.html>https://web.archive.org/web/20140101224551/http:/www.carnicominstitute.org/html/articles_by_date.html</a>,

In the post he wrote that he had received a sample of skin from a
Morgellons patient in the mail. He posted this photo of a fiber in the
sample, which he said was not a human hair because its diameter was
about 10-12 µm which was narrower than a human hair, and because the
fiber had an irregular twisted form:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-2.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>However he failed to mention that both the diameter and twisted shape
were characteristic of a fiber of cotton. He also posted these images of
fibers in the sample, which look like cotton because they have a flat
cupped shape, and they have the kind of twists that are called <span
class="quote">"convolutions"</span> in cotton:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-3.webp width=400><img src=i/clot-carnicom-4.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>In Carnicom's second post about Morgellons, he wrote about a sample
he is supposed to have received from another Morgellons patient. He
posted this close-up photo of one of the fibers in the sample, where you
can now see the flat cupped shape even more clearly:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704024133/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/morgobs2.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20120704024133/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/morgobs2.htm</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-carnicom-1.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Carnicom wrote that the diameter of the fiber was approximately 40
µm, which would be about 3-4 times wider than his earlier fiber that he
said was about 10-12 µm wide. Fibers of cotton typically have a diameter
of about 10-40 µm. However his estimates of the diameter might have a
fairly wide margin of error, because in another post he estimated that a
structure in his image had a diameter between 3 and 10 µm, so his
maximum estimate was more than 3 times higher than his minimum estimate.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602093219/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio11.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20120602093219/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/bio11.htm</a>]
He should've included scale bars in his microscope images.</p>
<p>Carnicom said that his filaments were composed of multiple <span
class="quote">"sub-micron filaments"</span> which were packed together
within a <span class="quote">"bounding filament"</span>. By the <span
class="quote">"sub-micron filaments"</span>, he appears to have referred
to the lengthwise striations which are characteristic of cotton. In one
post he wrote: <span class="quote">"The diameter of the bounding
filament generally ranges from 20-40 microns in thickness."</span>
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828061439/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/agents1.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20120828061439/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/agents1.htm</a>]
But in a later post, he wrote that the typical diameter of the <span
class="quote">"bounding filament"</span> was 12-20 µm and not 20-40 µm.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705215050/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/culture1.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20120705215050/http://www.carnicominstitute.org/articles/culture1.htm</a>]
But anyway, both 20-40 µm and 12-20 µm fit within the expected range of
diameter for fibers of cotton.</p>
