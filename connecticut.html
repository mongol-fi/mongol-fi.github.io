<p>In September 2024 Steve Kirsch published a spreadsheet for data from
Connecticut that contains rows for a total of about 500,000 people who
were enrolled on Medicare:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/i-have-been-fully-vindicated-by-the.><a
href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/i-have-been-fully-vindicated-by-the"
class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/i-have-been-fully-vindicated-by-the</a>.</a>
The file has columns for sex, date of death, vaccine brand, the dates of
the first 3 vaccine doses, and age at the time of the first dose. The
vaccine brand is presumably the brand of the first dose.</p>
<p>Kirsch obfuscated the vaccine brand names in his spreadsheet in order
to do his ChatGPT analysis, but this code converts the spreadsheet to a
CSV file with unobfuscated vaccine brand names, and it also converts the
dates to the ISO format and makes column names shorter:</p>

<p>The following script generates a file for the Connecticut data
similar to the files generated by Kirsch's <code>buckets.py</code>
script. The file shows the number of deaths and person-days grouped by
the month of vaccination, ongoing month, weeks since vaccination, dose
number, age, sex, and vaccine type. I assigned a random birthday to each
person in order to account for the aging of people over time with daily
precision:</p>

<p>I uploaded the output here:

<p>Medicare is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS). The website of HHS says: <span class="quote">"Generally,
Medicare is for people 65 or older. You may be able to get Medicare
earlier if you have a disability, End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent
kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant), or ALS (also called
Lou Gehrig's disease)."</span>

So in the code below where I calculated a mortality rate within a year
from the first dose, ages 60 to 64 had almost three times higher
mortality rate than ages 65 to 69:</p>

<p>In Kirsch's analysis of the Czech record-level data, his main
argument why Moderna vaccinese were unsafe than Pfizer vaccines was that
when he calculated age-specific mortality rates during the first year
from the first dose, Moderna got about 1.3 higher mortality rate than
Pfizer across various age groups. However I pointed out to him that it
might have been due to some confounders he didn't adjust for in his
analysis. In the plot below where I calculated an age-normalized
Moderna-Pfizer mortality ratio in the Czech data, my total ratio for all
months of vaccination aggregated together was about 1.3 like in Kirsch's
analysis, but my ratio fell close to 1.0 among people who were
vaccinated in the fourth quarter of 2021:
[<a href=czech2.html#Triangle_plot_of_Moderna_Pfizer_ratio>czech2.html#Triangle_plot_of_Moderna_Pfizer_ratio</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-mrr-triangle.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the new Connecticut data Kirsch now got about 10% higher mortality
rate for Pfizer than Moderna, but he again attributed the difference to
a difference in vaccine safety, even though this time Pfizer got higher
mortality rates than Moderna. When someone asked Kirsch to explain why
his results were now different to the Czech data, Kirsch replied: <span
class="quote">"it's a QA issue. Moderna is more deadly, but the batches
are even a greater problem."</span>
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/i-have-been-fully-vindicated-by-the/comment/70688177>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/i-have-been-fully-vindicated-by-the/comment/70688177</a>]</p>
<p>Kirsch also posted this tweet: <span class="quote">"This is in
Connecticut only. Other states had completely the opposite numbers and
it was statistically significant there as well."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1840121580405366903>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1840121580405366903</a>]
But I think he hasn't published the data for the other states.</p>
<p>In the following code I calculated age-normalized mortality rates in
the Connecticut data for each combination of vaccination month, ongoing
month, and vaccine brand. And when I divided the rate for Moderna with
the rate for Pfizer, the total ratio for all months of vaccination was
about 0.79. Moderna got a higher rate among people who got the first
dose in March, April, May, June, July, or September 2021, even though
during other months the age-normalized rate was higher for Pfizer. So I
think it shows that people who got Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had
different profiles of confounders during different months of
vaccination, even though I guess Kirsch might argue it was rather
because some batches were more deadly than others:</p>

<p>For third doses the total Moderna-Pfizer ratio was also about 0.8,
but for some reason the ratio temporarily shot up to about 1.44 among
people who got a third dose in September 2021, even though it fell back
down to about 0.60 in people who got the third dose in October 2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ct-triangle-third.png width=1400>
</div>
<p>I wasn't able to include doses from 2022 in the plots above, because
the Connecticut dataset only includes a total of 4 third doses with a
date in 2022. I don't know if the dataset was meant to only include
doses given before 2022 but a few doses from 2022 were accidentally
included.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination id=Deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination>Deaths
by weeks since vaccination</a>
</h2>
<p>Kirsch has claimed that the temporal healthy vaccinee effect only
lasts about 3 weeks, because in his old Medicare datasets when he has
plotted the number of deaths as a function of weeks since vaccination,
the period when there was clearly reduced mortality seemed to last only
about 3 weeks like in this plot:
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-2.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>There's a bump in deaths around days 20 to 25 after vaccination in
the old Medicare data for 2021, but a similar bump is missing from the
old Medicare data for 2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-medicare-15.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Kirsch's old Medicare data only included the earliest vaccine dose
for each person which was listed in the Medicare database, which was
generally the first dose. And in the elderly age groups which account
for most deaths, many people got the first dose in the first two months
of 2021 when there was rapidly decreasing mortality in the United States
because the COVID wave in the winter of 2020 to 2021 was passing by. So
I think it explains why my previous plot has a bump in deaths around
days 20 to 25 for doses given in 2021 but not for doses given in
2022.</p>
<p>In the Czech Republic first doses were also rolled out in early 2021
when there was a rapidly decreasing trend in mortality rate because the
COVID wave in the winter of 2020 to 2021 was passing by. In the plots
below for Czech record-level data, I calculated the light gray baseline
by multiplying the number of person-days for each combination of age and
month by the mortality rate for the same combination of age and month
among the general Czech population, so the there's a huge drop in the
light gray baseline during the first 10 weeks from vaccination. But in
the dark gray baseline I didn't use a different mortality rate for each
month but I simply used the total mortality rate for each age in
2021-2022 as the baseline. Based on the dark gray baseline which is only
normalized for age but not ongoing month, it would seem like the
temporal healthy vaccinee effect only lasts about 2 or 3 weeks, but
based on the light gray baseline the temporal HVE seems to last about 15
to 20 weeks:
[<a href=czech.html#Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose>czech.html#Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose</a>]</p>
<p width="000">
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-3.png width=500><img src=i/czech-weekafter-4.png width=500>
</p>
<p>Now when I reproduced the Czech plots above using the new Medicare
data, there is in fact a massive drop in the light gray baseline during
the first few weeks after vaccination. However the light baseline
started to increase after week 6, so when I calculated excess mortality
relative to the light gray baseline, there wasn't a very long extension
to the period that seems to be impacted by the temporal HVE:</p>

<p>In the plots for Connecticut data above there's close to 0% excess
mortality from week 20 onwards if you look at the light gray line where
each month has a different baseline. But in the plot for Czech data
there was about -20% to -10% excess mortality from around week 20
onwards. In both plots the baseline was derived from the mortality rate
of the general population which included both unvaccinated and
vaccinated people, but in the US plot vaccinated people who were not
included in the new Medicare dataset were included in the baseline but
not in the actual deaths.</p>
<p>At first I thought the reason why the plots for Connecticut had close
to 0% excess deaths might have been if vaccinated people who are on
Medicare had higher ASMR than vaccinated people in the general US
population, which might be if people on Medicare have lower SES than the
general US population. However I confused Medicaid which is meant for
low-income people with Medicare which includes almost the entire US
population aged 65 and above. ChatGPT said that about 95-98% of the US
population in ages 65 and above is enrolled on Medicare. And based on my
calculation below, about 97% of the Connecticut population in ages 65
and above was enrolled on Medicare:
[<a href=https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment>https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment</a>]</p>

# 440116 # people in Kirsch&#39;s dataset</pre>
<p>Based on the calculation above Kirsch's dataset includes only about
70% of the Connecticut population enrolled on Medicare, so Kirsch's
dataset seems to be missing some vaccinated people who are enrolled on
Medicare, because the percentage of vaccinated people among people who
are enrolled on Medicare is probably much higher than 70%.</p>
<p>But as another explanation for why I got close to 0% excess deaths in
my plots for Connecticut but not the Czech Republic, the percentage of
unvaccinated people is lower in the United States than the Czech
Republic, and it's even lower in northeastern states like Connecticut
than in the US as a whole. So even if unvaccinated people would have
twice as high mortality as vaccinated people in both Connecticut and the
Czech Republic, Connecticut has a smaller percentage of unvaccinated
people so they have less impact on my baseline mortality rate which
includes both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.</p>

<p>The Czech Republic had a wave of COVID deaths which peaked around
December 2021. But the plot below shows that in the Czech record-level
data in December 2021, unvaccinated people had a much more pronounced
spike in ASMR than vaccinated people, which might mean that the vaccines
were effective at preventing COVID deaths. However among vaccinated
people, the spike was more pronounced for Janssen and AstraZeneca which
are viral vector vaccines, but the spike was more flat for Moderna and
Pfizer which are mRNA vaccines, which might mean that the mRNA vaccines
had higher efficacy than the viral vector vaccines:

<p>Connecticut didn't have any major wave of COVID deaths after the
winter of 2020-2021, even though there was a spike in COVID deaths
around January 2022 which was smaller than the spike in the Czech
Republic around December 2021. In the plot below the spike around
January 2022 seems to be more pronounced for Jansssen than Moderna or
AstraZeneca, which again might mean that Janssen had lower efficacy than
the mRNA vaccines (even though it's hard to tell because Janssen also
has wide confidence intervals because of a small sample size, and
Janssen also has another fairly large spike in deaths in August 2021
which may have been due to random noise and not COVID because there was
a low prevalence of COVID in August 2021):</p>

<p>The next plot shows shows that in April 2021 when new vaccine doses

negative. And spikes in excess deaths also coincided with spikes in PCR

<p>However I suspect the new Medicare dataset has some third doses
listed as first doses if they were the earliest known dose in the
Medicare database. The old Medicare spreadsheet that Kirsch released in
February 2023 included these comments:

</div>
<p>The new Medicare data has no people with a first dose missing, which
would be unusual if the new Medicare data would be missing doses for
people who got vaccinated outside the Medicare system like in the old
Medicare data, unless in fact the first dose means the earliest dose
that was included in the Medicare database which was not always the
actual first dose.</p>

<p>Ulf Lorré published a Substack post about the Connecticut data, where
he included these plots which appear to show that the temporal healthy
vaccinee effect is much stronger for Moderna than Pfizer vaccines:

<img src=i/ct-weektype-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>However he didn't take into account that in the first three months of
2021, all-cause mortality in Connecticut was falling rapidly because the
COVID wave in the winter of 2020 to 2021 was passing by, but the
percentage of doses administered by the end of March 2021 was about 70%
for Pfizer but about 50% for Moderna. There was also an increasing trend
in the background mortality rate during the last three months of 2021,
but the percentage of first doses that were administered in the last
three months of 2021 was about 37% for Moderna and 17% for Pfizer (even
though most of those were probably misclassified third doses):</p>

<p>In the next plot I plotted deaths by weeks since vaccination and
vaccine type, but I calculated a baseline number of deaths by
multiplying the number of person-days for each combination of month and
age with the mortality rate in Connecticut for the same combination of
month and age. I had to aggregate together ages 85 and above because I
used population estimates published by the US Census Bureau where ages
85 and above were aggregated together.

But anyway, during the first 10 weeks from vaccination, Pfizer had a
sharp drop in the baseline but the baseline for Moderna remained roughly
flat:</p>

<p>Ulf Lorré got a higher risk ratio for Pfizer than Moderna in most
ages which had a sufficiently large sample size:

<p>However the Moderna-Pfizer mortality ratio also varies heavily
depending on the month of vaccination. Here among people who got the
first dose in March, April, May, June, July, or September 2021, Moderna
got a higher normalized mortality rate than Pfizer in most age
groups:</p>

of deaths by weeks since vaccination to other datasets</a>
</h2>
<p>In March 2022 Clare Craig, Martin Neil, Norman Fenton, and Scott
McLachlan published a preprint titled <span class="quote">"Official
mortality data for England reveal systematic undercounting of deaths
occurring within first two weeks of Covid-19 vaccination"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358979921_Official_mortality_data_for_England_reveal_systematic_undercounting_of_deaths_occurring_within_first_two_weeks_of_Covid-19_vaccination>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358979921_Official_mortality_data_for_England_reveal_systematic_undercounting_of_deaths_occurring_within_first_two_weeks_of_Covid-19_vaccination</a>]
Craig et al. speculated that because the ONS dataset for deaths by
vaccination status had a low number of non-COVID deaths in the first two
weeks after vaccination, deaths that occurred soon after vaccination
were somehow systematically omitted or misclassified.</p>
<p>However there is also a very low number of deaths in the first few
weeks after vaccination in the old record-level datasets that Kirsch has
published from New Zealand, the Maldives, and the United States. The
datasets show the date of vaccination and date of death of individual
people, so you can calculate the number of deaths by weeks since
vaccination manually so that you know for sure that there is no trick
used where vaccinated people would be classified as unvaccinated for 1
to 3 weeks after vaccination. I have pointed it out to Neil and Fenton
and I have tried to get them to look at Kirsch's record-level datasets,
but I don't think I have been successful.</p>
<p>Craig et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"The healthy vaccinee
hypothesis, that those close to death will postpone or decline
vaccination might hypothetically account for a lower rate of death in
the first two weeks. But as an explanation it is only plausible if every
possible death that might occur in the first two weeks, after the offer
of vaccination, was foreknown whilst those deaths in the third week were
not, and hence those dying in the third week did not postpone or decline
vaccination."</span> However Craig et al. didn't take into account that
the temporal healthy vaccinee effect actually lasts longer than 2 weeks,
but if you plot deaths by weeks since the first dose in England, the
increasing trend in mortality caused by the waning out of the temporal
HVE is counteracted by the decreasing trend in the background mortality
rate, because many first doses in England were given in the first three
months of 2021 when the mortality rate was falling rapidly because the
COVID wave in the winter was passing by.</p>
<p>A similar effect can be seen in the plot below which shows deaths by
weeks since the first dose in the new Connecticut Medicare data and in
the Czech record-level data, because in both Connecticut and the Czech
Republic many people got first doses at a time when there was a sharply
decreasing background mortality rate because a COVID wave was passing
by. But in New Zealand the period after vaccination when there was
reduced mortality seems to last longer, because New Zealand had not yet
been hit by COVID in 2021 when first dose was rolled out:</p>

<p>However I guess Clare Craig may have later come to the conclusion
that the low number of deaths during the first two weeks might be due to
the HVE, because in 2024 when someone asked her what she meant by the

show that the first few weeks after vaccination are outliers because
people who are feeling ill postpone."</span>

<a href=#ChatGPTs_comments_about_Kirschs_analysis id=ChatGPTs_comments_about_Kirschs_analysis>ChatGPT's
comments about Kirsch's analysis</a>
</h2>
<p>Kirsch's analysis of the Connecticut data mostly relied on ChatGPT
which he called the <span class="quote">"world's most objective
epidemiologist"</span>. So when I pasted Kirsch's Substack post to
ChatGPT and asked if his analysis was valid, ChatGPT raised several good
points about the analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>No adjustment for confounders</strong>: The analysis admits
that it doesn't control for critical variables (e.g., age, preexisting
health conditions, socioeconomic status, access to care), which are
vital in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.</li>
<li><strong>Age Standardization</strong>: While ChatGPT was prompted to
account for age distribution differences, confounding factors go beyond
just age. Adjusting for only one variable when others (e.g., sex, race,
preexisting conditions) might also play significant roles results in an
incomplete analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>[...]</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P-values</strong>: The p-value of 2.39e-176, though
statistically significant, does not in itself confirm the safety or
danger of a vaccine. Statistical significance does not equate to
clinical or practical significance. The magnitude of the difference
(10%) needs to be evaluated in the context of all relevant confounders,
not just p-values.</li>
<li><strong>Causality</strong>: Statistical significance does not imply
causality. The analysis fails to establish a causal link between the
vaccine and the alleged 10% increase in mortality. Observing higher
mortality in one group does not mean the vaccine caused it.</li>
</ul>
<p>[...]</p>
<ul>
<li>The analysis generalizes findings based on incomplete data from one
region (Connecticut) and compares it with a separate dataset from the
Czech Republic. The fact that different conclusions were drawn about
vaccine safety in different regions (Pfizer in Connecticut vs. Moderna
in Czech Republic) could reflect underlying differences in healthcare
systems, data collection methods, and population demographics. Instead
of questioning product quality control, the analysis should consider
these variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>[...]</p>
<ul>
<li>The conclusion that vaccines <span class="quote">"never
worked"</span> and that <span class="quote">"the debate is over"</span>
lacks sufficient scientific backing. The claims appear based on
cherry-picked interpretations of data rather than rigorous,
peer-reviewed studies. The use of emotional language (<span
class="quote">"whoops,"</span> <span class="quote">"we should be
done"</span>) undermines the credibility of the analysis and suggests
bias.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a href=#ASMR_by_month_of_vaccination id=ASMR_by_month_of_vaccination>ASMR
by month of vaccination</a>
</h2>
<p>In the New Zealand released by Barry Young, in the English UKHSA FOI
data that was given to Clare Craig in May 2024, and in the Czech
record-level data, I have identified a phenomenon I'm calling the <span
class="quote">"early vaccinee effect"</span>, where there was
subsequently low mortality in the early vaccinees who got vaccinated
during the rollout peak or during the period leading up to the peak, but
there was subsequently much higher mortality in the late vaccinees who
got vaccinated after the rollout peak had passed.</p>
<p>Now the plot below shows that a similar phenomenon can also be seen
in the new Connecticut data, where in the case of both Pfizer and
Moderna, there was low mortality in Feburary 2021 when there was the
highest number of first doses administered, but people vaccinated over
the next months had considerably higher ASMR (even though people who got
the first dose in the last 3 months of 2021 subsequently had fairly low
ASMR, but most of those doses were actually misclassified third
doses):</p>

<p>The plot above also shows that in December 2020 Pfizer accounted for
almost all administered vaccine doses, but people who got a Pfizer
vaccine in December 2020 subsequently had very high ASMR. So could it be
that vulnerable people who were priorized during early rollout are
overrepresented among people who got a Pfizer vaccine? It might
partially explain why during the first three months in the plot above
Pfizer has higher ASMR than Moderna but afterwards it's the other way
around. (Even though on the other hand the total number of doses
administered in December 2020 is so small that it doesn't have much
impact on the total ASMR across all vaccination months combined, and
Pfizer also had higher ASMR than Moderna in January and February 2021
which were the two months that had the highest number of Pfizer doses
administered.)</p>
