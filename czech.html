<a href=#Background id=Background>Background</a>
</h2>
<p>In March 2024 Stanislav VeselyÃÅ received a FOI response of vaccination
data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the
Czech Republic: <a href=https://www.skirsch.com/covid/CzechFOIA.pdf.><a
href="https://www.skirsch.com/covid/CzechFOIA.pdf"
class="uri">https://www.skirsch.com/covid/CzechFOIA.pdf</a>.</a> The
dataset includes rows for about 11 million people, who have columns for
the year of birth, date of death, dates of vaccination for doses 1-7,
and the type and batch number of each dose.</p>
<p>The data was already uploaded to GitHub in March 2024, but it was
almost completely overlooked until Steve Kirsch published his analysis
of the data in July 2024:

<a href=#Were_Pfizer_and_Moderna_vaccines_allocated_randomly id=Were_Pfizer_and_Moderna_vaccines_allocated_randomly>Were
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines allocated randomly?</a>
</h2>
<p>In an earlier version of the GitHub repository about the Czech data,
Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"Vaccines were randomly distributed
for those wishing to get vaxxed. [...] People were not allowed to select
which vaccines they got. [...] The randomization of which vaccine someone
got created a perfect real-world randomized clinical trial where we
could compute the mortality rates for 1 year after Dose 2 for the two
most popular vaccines."</span>
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/5725ac1b64ede7124e00b72af68892f31736b349/README.md>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/5725ac1b64ede7124e00b72af68892f31736b349/README.md</a>]</p>
<p>However I didn't find any source which said that the vaccines were
actually allocated randomly in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>In the FOIA record-level the average year of birth is about 1973 for
people whose vaccine type for the second dose was <span
class="quote">"Comirnaty"</span> (Pfizer) but about 1966 for <span
class="quote">"SPIKEVAX"</span> (Moderna), which indicates that the
vaccine types were not allocated randomly. And there's also about 6
million people whose second vaccine type was Comirnaty but only about
500,000 people whose second vaccine type was Spikevax:</p>

<p>Kirsch included these comments in the file
<code>Pfizer v. Moderna mortality by age.xlsx</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="a-simpsons-paradox-example-here-that-really-surprised-us">A
Simpson's paradox example here that really surprised us</h3>
<p>There is a really interesting simpson's paradox due to ratios. For
each individual age, the MRR (mortality rate ratio) rarely go above
2.25. Yet when you divide the CMR for Moderna/Pfizer, you get 2.25.</p>
<p>You can see this in the calculation on the Combined but skip tab at
the bottom.</p>
<p>But of course our result isn't a simpson's paradox because we
computed the CMR ratios by single digit age groups and five year
brackets and plotted it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However people who received a Moderna vaccine were older on average
than people who received a Pfizer vaccine, which explains why Kirsch's
ratio is higher for all ages aggregated together than for individual age
groups.</p>
<p>Added later: Kirsch later edited the README file at GitHub and he
told me: "i've changed randomly to non-systematically in the github.
sorry for the error."</p>

<p>Here's different versions of the output produced by the script:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=f/czbuckets.csv.gz>f/czbuckets.csv.gz</a> (6 MiB): Deaths
and person-days grouped by ongoing month, month of vaccination, weeks
since vaccination, age, dose number, and vaccine type. People are
removed under earlier doses after a new dose.</li>
<li><a href=f/czbucketskeep.csv.gz>f/czbucketskeep.csv.gz</a> (8 MiB):
Same as <code>czbuckets.csv.gz</code> but people are kept under earlier
doses after a new dose.</li>
<li><a href=f/czbucketsbatchkeep.csv.xz>f/czbucketsbatchkeep.csv.xz</a>
(38 MiB): Same as <code>czbucketskeep.csv</code> but with an additional
column for batch identifier.</li>
<li><a href=f/czbucketsdaily.csv.gz>f/czbucketsdaily.csv.gz</a> (2 MiB):
Deaths and person-days grouped by ongoing day, age, and dose number.
People are removed under earlier doses after a new dose.</li>
</ul>
<p>My code is similar to the <code>buckets.py</code> script provided by
Kirsch except my code accounts for the aging of people over time
correctly. In <code>buckets.py</code> each person has a constant age
that is either the age on the day of death for people who died or the
age on the day when the script was ran for people who didn't die (and in
both cases the age is calculated incorrectly as a floored division of
the age in days by 365).
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/main/code/buckets.py>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/main/code/buckets.py</a>]
So if for example the <code>buckets.py</code> script is ran in July
2024, the age of someone who was born in January 1950 and who didn't die
is treated as 74 even during 2020.</p>

<p>In the record-level data unvaccinated people had an ASMR of about
2064 in 2021 and 1865 in 2022, but it might partially be because of the
healthy vaccinee effect because people with 1 or 2 doses also had high
ASMR in 2022:</p>

<p>In the code below I used a simplified but somewhat inaccurate method
to calculate ASMR within the first 365 days from the first dose, so that
I treated the age of each person as their year of birth subtracted from
2021, and I didn't remove people from the population size after they
died. I only included people who got the first dose before 2022 so all
people had at least 365 days of follow-up time to die after vaccination,
since the record-level data only includes deaths up to the end of
2022.</p>
<p>I got about 32% higher ASMR for Moderna than Pfizer, but they were
still both far below the ASMR of the total Czech population in 2021 and
2022:</p>

<a href=#Plot_for_ASMR_by_dose_and_date id=Plot_for_ASMR_by_dose_and_date>Plot
for ASMR by dose and date</a>
</h2>
<p>In the plot below the ASMR of people with one dose shoots up when the
second dose is rolled out, and the ASMR of people with two doses shoots
up when the third dose is rolled out. Martin Neil and Norman Fenton
speculated that a similar phenomenon in the English ONS data was
explained by the so-called cheap trick, where people were categorized
under the previous vaccine dose for a certain number of weeks after a
new vaccine dose, so that for example a death that occured soon after
the second dose would've been classified under the first dose. Jeffrey
Morris said that the phenomenon was explained by the healthy vaccinee
effect instead, because the healthy vaccinees who move under the nth
dose have low mortality, it means that the so-called unhealthy
stragglers who remain under dose n-1 will have increased mortality.
However the same kind of a phenomenon can also be seen in the Czech data
even though it doesn't employ the cheap trick, which makes it seem more
likely that Morris was right and Neil and Fenton were wrong. And the New
Zealand data released by Barry Young doesn't employ the cheap trick
either but the same phenomenon can also be seen in Barry's data.</p>
<p>From the plot below you can also see that during a COVID wave in
December 2021, unvaccinated people have a big spike in mortality but
there is essentially no spike in mortality in people with 3 doses, and
there is only a small spike in the black line which shows the mortality
among all vaccinated people. People with 2 doses do have a big increase
in mortality in November to December 2021, but it's probably not only
because of COVID but also because a lot of people got the third dose so
the unhealthy stragglers were left under the second dose:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-asmr.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above the dark gray line shows the mortality rate among
both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the record-level data, and
the light gray line shows the mortality rate based on the weekly number
of deaths in 5-year age groups reported by the Czech Statistical Office
combined with population estimates from Eurostat.
[<a href=https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/number-of-deaths-weekly-and-monthly-time-series>https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/number-of-deaths-weekly-and-monthly-time-series</a>,
<a href=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database>https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database</a>]
The discrepancy between the lines might partially be because I used
5-year age groups up to 95+ for the dark gray line but 90+ for the light
gray line.</p>

</h2>
<p>Kirsch included this comment in the file
<code>CR time series analysis.xlsx</code>: <span class="quote">"MR
peaking 35 weeks after the shots #2 for male and female is hard for them
to explain. It can't be HVE because HVE doesn't <span
class="quote">'peak'</span>."</span></p>
<p>For example in this plot the mortality rate peaks on week 30 after
the second dose:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-dose2peak.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>However it's because the mortality rate of people who remained under
the second dose shot up when the third dose was rolled out, and people
got the third dose about 30 weeks after the second dose on average:</p>
<pre>&gt; rec=fread(&quot;CR_records.csv&quot;)
&gt; mean(rec$Datum_3-rec$Datum_2,na.rm=T)/7
[1] 29.6133</pre>
<p>The average date of third doses is only about 26 weeks later than the
average date of second doses:</p>
<pre>&gt; as.Date(mean(rec$Datum_2,na.rm=T))
[1] &quot;2021-07-09&quot;
&gt; as.Date(mean(rec$Datum_3,na.rm=T))

&gt; (mean(rec$Datum_3,na.rm=T)-mean(rec$Datum_2,na.rm=T))/7
[1] 25.57143</pre>
<p>However people who got both the second and third dose got the second
dose much earlier on average than people who only got the second dose
(because younger people got vaccinated later and younger people were
less likely to get a booster):</p>
<pre>&gt; as.Date(mean(rec$Datum_2[!is.na(rec$Datum_3)],na.rm=T))
[1] &quot;2021-06-10&quot; # average date of second dose for people who also got a third dose
&gt; as.Date(mean(rec$Datum_2[is.na(rec$Datum_3)],na.rm=T))

<a href=#Excess_mortality_relative_to_all_people_matched_by_age id=Excess_mortality_relative_to_all_people_matched_by_age>Excess
mortality relative to all people matched by age</a>
</h2>
<p>Here for each combination of month and dose number, I derived the
expected number of deaths by multiplying the number of person-days for
each single year of age by the mortality rate that month of the same age
among all people who are included in the dataset, and I added together
the expected deaths for each age to get the baseline number of deaths
among all ages.</p>
<p>For example in January 2021 the mortality rate of all people aged 70
in the dataset was about 9.734e-5 deaths per person-days, so the
expected number of deaths was about 2.606 (from
<code>9.734e-5*26871</code>). So the excess mortality percent was about
<code>(2/2.606-1)*100</code> which is about -23%. When I repeated the
same calculation for all ages, the expected number of deaths for all
ages added together was about 523.6. But the actual number of deaths was
326, so the total excess mortality percent was about
<code>(326/523.6-1)*100</code> which is about -38%.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-composition.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above the excess mortality of unvaccinated people peaks
in December 2021 when there was a COVID wave. And conversely in December
2021 the excess mortality of the <span class="quote">"All
vaccinated"</span> group is also lower than in the surrounding
months.</p>
<p>In the plot above I used a different baseline for each month, so the
excess mortality rates were adjusted for seasonal variation in mortality
and the effect of COVID waves. But in the next plot I'm using the total
mortality rate in 2021-2022 as the baseline throughout the plot, which
increases the excess mortality percentages during the COVID wave in
December 2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-composition-2.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above unvaccinated people have 174% excess mortality in
December 2021 but 43% in September 2021, so it's an approximately
1.92-fold increase in mortality (from
<code>(173.53+100)/(42.68+100)</code>). But vaccinated people only have
an approximately 1.54-fold increase in mortality when December 2021 is
compared to September 2021 (from <code>(5.46+100)/(-31.64+100)</code>).
In the US Medicare data that Kirsch published in 2023, the spikes in
deaths during COVID waves were also bigger in unvaccinated people than
vaccinated people.</p>

<p>In the New Zealand data released by Barry Young, I noticed an effect
where people who got vacinated during the early part of the main vaccine
rollout subsequently had lower excess mortality than people who got
vaccinated later on, which I called the <span class="quote">"early
vaccinee effect"</span>. I later also noticed a similar effect in a May
2024 FOI response to Clare Craig, which showed the number of deaths in
England by week of vaccination, month of death, and age group:
<a href=statistic.html#Clare_Craig_May_2024_UKHSA_FOI_response_for_deaths_in_vaccinated_people>statistic.html#Clare_Craig_May_2024_UKHSA_FOI_response_for_deaths_in_vaccinated_people</a>.</p>
<p>A similar early vaccinee effect is also visible in the Czech data.
The monthly number of first doses given peaked in May 2021, so people
who got the first vaccine dose during February to May 2021 subsequently
had the lowest excess mortality, but people who got vaccinated in June
2021 already had close to 0% excess mortality, and the excess mortality
gradually increased to over 100% in people who waited until 2022 to get
the first dose:</p>

</h2>
<p>The plot below shows excess mortality by the type of the first
vaccine. People with two or more doses almost always got the second dose
from the same vaccine type as the first dose, except Janssen vaccines
only had a single dose so people who got a Janssen vaccine for the first
dose often got a different type of vaccine for the booster.</p>
<p>The plot below shows that even in late 2022, people got a Moderna
vaccine for the first dose had much higher excess mortality than people
who got a Pfizer vaccine for the first dose. If the difference in
mortality would be because of vaccine deaths like Kirsch says, you'd
expect the difference to be greatest in the first few weeks or months
after vaccination and get weaker over time. But because the difference
remains in place more than a year after vaccination, it rather seems to
be caused by some confounding factors which I didn't adjust for
here:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-firstdosetype.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above Janssen vaccines get by far the highest excess
mortality percentage, but it's probably because the average date of
first vaccination is much later for Janssen vaccines than for the other
three vaccine types, so the <span class="quote">"late vaccinees"</span>
who got vaccinated in the second half of 2021 are overrepresented among
the people who got a Janssen vaccine.</p>
<p>In the next plot the x-axis shows the month of vaccination and not
the month of death, and the number in each cell is the excess mortality
up to the end of 2022 and not the excess mortality on the month that is
shown on the x-axis. The plot shows that people who got a Pfizer vaccine
in late 2021 subsequently also had much higher excess mortality than
people who got a Pfizer vaccine in the first half of 2021:</p>

<p>The plot below is otherwise similar to the first plot except the
baseline is the mortality among only unvaccinated people instead of both
unvaccinated and vaccinated people. It shows that during the COVID wave
in December 2021, people with a first dose from a Moderna vaccine had
about 65% lower deaths than unvaccinated people matched by age (even
though Kirsch was making it seem like people with a Moderna vaccine were
dropping like flies):</p>

<h2>
<a href=#Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose id=Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose>Deaths
by weeks after first dose</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2023 Kirsch published a table of data from Medicare which showed
the number of deaths by days since the first COVID vaccine given in 2021
that was listed in the database, which was generally the first dose of
each person. The table seems to have a bump in deaths about 20-30 days
after vaccination, which I speculated might have been because of people
who died soon after the second dose, because the second dose was often
given about 3-4 weeks after the first dose:
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In the plot below the dark green points show the same data for deaths
in 2021 as the screenshot above. The spline that I fitted to the dark
green points seems to have a bump where it's temporarily elevated around
day 25 from vaccination, but the red line for deaths in the year 2022
has a more smooth curve with no clear increase around day 25. I though
it might have been because most of the doses given in 2022 were booster
doses, and people didn't get a second booster dose right after the first
booster, so in the scenario where the bump in the dark green line was
caused by people dying from the second dose, the bump could've been
missing from the red line because people didn't get the second booster
soon after the first booster:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-medicare-15.png width=600>
</div>
<p>I noticed that the Czech data also seems to be a bump in deaths
around weeks 2-4 after vaccination (where week 0 consists of the day of
vaccination and the next 6 days):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter.png width=700>
</div>
<p>However in the plot above my baseline was not adjusted for seasonal
variation in mortality, because I calculated the baseline based on the
total mortality rates for each age in 2021-2022. In the plot below the
dark gray baseline was calculated the same way as in the plot above. But
if you look at the light gray baseline which is adjusted for seasonal
variation in mortality and for the impact of COVID waves, there's a big
fall in the baseline during the first 10 weeks after vaccination,
because many people got vaccinated during a period of time from March to
May 2021 when COVID deaths fell from the highest point during the
pandemic to near zero:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In the plot above if you compare the black line for deaths against
the dark gray baseline that is not adjusted for seasonality, the period
after vaccination that has clearly reduced mortality seems to last only
about 2 weeks, which is surprisingly short compared to other datasets
like Barry Young's data from New Zealand. But the period with reduced
mortality is actually longer if you compare the black line against the
light gray line instead, as you can see from this plot which shows the
excess percentage of deaths relative to the baseline:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-4.png width=500>
</div>
<p>So I suspect the reason why the US Medicare data had a spike in
deaths around days 20-30 might similarly be because many people received
the first dose in January to February 2021 when there was a sharp spike
in excess mortality in the United States, but by March 2021 the excess
mortality had fallen down close to zero.</p>

it calculates a seasonality-adjusted linear trend of the mortality rate

in younger age groups:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-ageweek.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the plot above my baseline was the total mortality rate among both
vaccinated and unvaccinated people, which results in a bias where age
groups with a higher percentage of vaccinated people tend to have excess
mortality closer to zero. If for example there is one age group where
there's 90% vaccinated people, and vaccinated people have a mortality
rate of 123 and unvaccinated people have a mortality rate of 246, then
it would result in only about -9% excess mortality for vaccinated people
(from <code>123/(123*.90+246*.1)-1</code>). But if 60% of people are
vaccinated then vaccinated people would be about -29% excess mortality
with the same mortality rates.of 123 and 246.</p>
<p>However the bias doesn't probably explain why ages 90+ don't have as
low excess mortality during the first weeks of vaccination as younger
age groups, because the Czech data actually has a lower percentage of
vaccinated people in ages 90+ than in ages 50-79:</p>

<p>In order to avoid the bias, in the next plot I calculated the
baseline, based on the trend in mortality rates within five-year age
groups in 2010-2019. However now my excess mortality on weeks 0-4 was
about -61% for ages 50-59 but only about -37% for ages 90+, even though
later on the difference got smaller, which might indicate that the
temporal healthy vaccinee effect might in fact be less strong in the
oldest age groups:</p>

<p>This is the pivot table analysis for Study #1 which enrolled any who
got their first COVID shot anytime in 2021.</p>
<p>Note that if you didn't get a second shot, it's highly likely that it
is because you died.</p>
<p>However the mortality rate ratio (MRR) which is
MR(Moderna)/MR(Pfizer) is also high for those people when it should be 1
if both vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>See the Detail 1 tab which shows that the MRR ratio is &gt;1 for each
and every 5 year age group examined which eliminates the Simpson's
paradox.</p>
<h3 id="additional-note">Additional note</h3>
<p>Those who mixed vaccines between dose 1 vs.¬†dose 2 had the highest
increase in ACM.</p>
<p>The high MR line items for the second vaccine being None is likely
because those people died before their second vaccine so this should not
be misinterpreted as you must get two vaccines or you'll die.</p>
<p>Note that if you Moderna then Pfizer vs.¬†Pfizer and then Moderna, the
MRS were nearly identical around 2175) so the order of shots did not
matter!!!</p>
<p>However, the MR of a mixed dose did NOT give you an MR between the
two pure vaccines. It was higher than pure Pfizer or pure Moderna.</p>
<p>Note that MOST people did not mix brands between dose 1 and dose
2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the code below I calculated ASMR during the first year from the
first dose using the same simple but inaccurate method as earlier, where
I treated the age of each person as their year of birth subtracted from
2021. However I actually got very low ASMR for people who got Pfizer for
the first dose and Moderna for the second dose (even though they
consisted of only 279 people so the confidence interval is huge):</p>

<p>But actually ASMR is unreliable in cases like this where there's only
a small number of people and the people can be unevenly distributed
across age groups. In the following code I calculated the expected
number of deaths by multiplying the Czech mortality rate for each age in
2021-2022 with the number of people for each age. I looked at all 6
pairs of crossovers between Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines,
but the total excess mortality between them was only about -18%:</p>

<p>In the output above Pfizer-Moderna has a similar excess mortality
percent as Moderna-Pfizer, even though in the block of output before it
Moderna-Pfizer got over 3 times higher ASMR than Pfizer-Moderna. However
that's because the Moderna-Pfizer group had one death in ages 10-19 and
one death in ages 40-49, which together added over 500 units to the
total ASMR value. With ASMR, the mortality rates of younger age groups
that make up a large percent of the standard population are given more
weight than the mortality rates of the oldest age groups that make up a
small percent of the standard population:</p>

<p>In the Czech Republic spikes in excess mortality coincide with spikes
in PCR positivity like in other countries, except that after Omicron
there seems to be high PCR positivity coupled with low excess mortality,
which is also similiar to many other countries. In winter 2020-2021
there's a weird three-hump pattern where there's three different spikes
in excess deaths, but each of them also coincides with a spike in PCR
positivity. And around mid-2021 when the number of new vaccine doses
given peaked, there was low excess mortality.</p>

<p>After mid-2021 when new vaccine doses peaked, there were only two
relatively brief periods when the mortality was clearly elevated above
the baseline. The first was during the COVID spike around December 2021.
The second was around December 2022 when many European countries had a
spike in all-cause deaths but not COVID deaths, which was probably
caused by influenza A since it coincided with a peak in the number of
positive tests for influenza A:

<p>Germany also had a sharp spike in excess deaths in December 2022,
which coincided with a high incidence of influenza-like illness and
acute respiratory illness reported by the Robert Koch Institute's
GrippeWeb service, but at the same time there was a low number of COVID
deaths compared to the two previous winters:

<p>Kirsch seems to suggest that a large part of the Czech excess
mortality after vaccination can be attributed to the vaccines, and he
also says that the vaccines don't necessarily kill people soon after
vaccination but they result in a chronic increase in mortality, because
his plots show that the number of deaths by weeks since vaccination goes
up over time, and he has attributed the increase in his plots to deaths
caused by vaccines. But then from mid-2021 onwards after most people had
been vaccinated, why were the excess deaths concentrated into two
relatively sharp spikes around December 2021 and December 2022? And if
vaccines killed a particularly high number of people in December 2021,
then why was the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated ASMR elevated in
December 2021?</p>

<p>In the code above I excluded people who were born in 2021 or later or
who had died before 2021. But the total population size in the
record-level data was still about 1-2% higher than the resident
population estimates in the 2021 census and Eurostat. But both of them
only included the resident population, so I don't know if the
record-level data also includes non-residents.</p>

<p>In December 2023 Kirsch published record-level data from the Maldives
which included a complete or nearly complete table of people who died in
the Maldives in 2021-2022 along with their dates of vaccination.
[<a href=moar.html#Data_for_deaths_in_2020_2023_in_Maldives>moar.html#Data_for_deaths_in_2020_2023_in_Maldives</a>]
I used the data to calculate a rough ratio of unvaccinated CMR to
vaccinated CMR so that during for example in May 2021 when about 41.922%
of people were unvaccinated and there were 122 deaths in unvaccinated
people and 81 deaths in vaccinated people, I calculated the ratio as
<code>(122/41.922)/(81/(100-41.922))</code>, which is about 2.1. In May
and June 2021 when Maldives had the most COVID deaths, the ratio of
unvaccinated to vaccinated CMR was about 2.1, but the ratio was much
lower in the surrounding months, which seems to indicate that
unvaccinated people were more likely to die of COVID:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-maldives-1.png width=900>
</div>
<p>The method I used to calculate the mortality ratios in the Maldives
didn't even take into account that vaccinated people were older on
average than unvaccinated people, so I would've probably gotten higher
ratios if I would've been able to calculate mortality ratios normalized
by age.</p>
<p>However now with the Czech data I was able to use a more
sophisticated method to calculate a ratio between unvaccinated and
vaccinated mortality so that it was adjusted for age, but I still got
similar results where the ratio was temporarily elevated during a period
of months that had a high number of COVID deaths.</p>

<p>The ratio column below shows the ASMR in people whose first dose was
Moderna divided by the ASMR in people whose first dose was Pfizer. The
ratio is actually lower than usual during the COVID wave in November to
December 2021. It might possibly indicate that Moderna vaccines were
more effective in preventing COVID deaths than Pfizer vaccines, even
though it might also indicate that there's some confounding factors
which caused people who got a Moderna vaccine to be less likely to die
from COVID:</p>

<p>Here during the period from October 2020 to April 2021 which had high
excess mortality because of COVID, the excess mortality seems to have
fallen back down earlier in older age groups, so it first fell close to
zero in January in ages 90+, in April in ages 80-89, in May in ages
70-79, and in June in ages 60-69. It might be because older age groups
got vaccinated earlier than younger age groups:</p>
<div>

<p>This shows that the percentage of vaccinated person-days out of all

<p>In the plot above I thought that maybe the reason why the excess
mortality fell close to 0% earlier in older age groups might have been
some kind of an artifact of the method I used to calculate the baseline,
because in the dataset for weekly deaths by age group I used to
calculate the baseline, ages 90 and above were aggregated together and
younger ages were split into 5-year age groups, so it might result in
the excess mortality of the oldest age groups in being understated if
the upper ends of the age groups were overrepresented in the
record-level data relative to the lower ends. And I also projected the
baseline for each age group into the future by doing a linear regression
of the mortality rate in 2010-2019, which might not be accurate for all
age groups.</p>
<p>So therefore I made the plot below where I used a different baseline,
where I first calculated the total mortality rates in the record-level
data for each single year of age in 2020-2022, except I aggregated
together ages 100 and above. And then in order to derive the expected
number of deaths for each cell of the heatmap, I multiplied a vector of
person-days for each age in the cell by a vector of the total mortality
rates for each age in 2020-2022. However it also gave me a similar
result, where during the period with high excess deaths that lasted for
late 2020 until early 2021, the excess deaths fell back down first in
ages 90+, next in ages 80-89, and later in the younger age groups:</p>

<p>The README file in Kirsch's GitHub repository includes this
table:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-mrr.png width=500>
</div>
<p>I thought the difference might partially be if people who got
vaccinated later had a higher Moderna-Pfizer ratio and younger people
got vaccinated later than older people, so I made the heatmap below. I
didn't calculate CMR for each age group like Kirsch, but I calculated
the ASMR for each single year of age within an age group and then I
added together the results to get the total ASMR for the ten-year age
groups (where the ASMR for a single age is the CMR of the age multiplied
by the fraction of the age in the standard population).</p>
<p>But anyway my heatmap below shows that the Moderna-Pfizer ratio was
actually the highest in ages 90+, even though it was fairly low in ages
70-79 and 80-89.</p>
<p>For some reason people who got vaccinated in April 2021 subsequently
had a low Moderna-Pfizer ratio of only about 1.1. But ages 70-79
received a large number of first doses in April 2021, which might
partially explain their low ratio.</p>
<p>The Moderna-Pfizer ratio seems to have gotten lower starting from
around October 2021. Among people who received the first vaccine dose in
October 2021, November 2021, or February 2022, Pfizer had higher total
ASMR than Moderna, so the Moderna-Pfizer ratio was below 1. So there
seem to be some confounding factors which cause the ratio to shift
dramatically over time:</p>

</h2>
<p>Czech Republic had a period of high excess deaths that lasted from
roughly the fourth quarter of 2020 until the second quarter of 2021,
which had an unusual pattern where there were three distinct humps in
the deaths. In ages 40-59 and 60-79 the first hump was the lowest and
the third hump was the highest. But in ages 80+ the first jump was the
highest and the third hump was the lowest, which might be because ages
80+ got vaccinated the earliest so many people in ages 80+ had already
been vaccinated by the time of the third hump, and some people had even
been vaccinated by the time of the second hump:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-facet.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The plot above shows that there was a spike in deaths around December
2021, which a lot of people will probably blame on deaths caused by the
first booster which was rolled out around the same time. In the plot
above the spike in December 2021 is difficult to see or nonexistent in
ages 0-19 and 20-39. However in the case of ages 40-59, 60-79, and 80+,
the peak in deaths occurs in December in each of the age groups, even
though the peak in new vaccine doses occurs earlier in older age groups
and later in younger age groups, so that vaccine doses peak in November
in ages 80+, in December in ages 60-79, and in January in ages
40-59.</p>
<p>In Denis Rancourt's paper about southern-hemisphere and equatorial
countries, he included the plots for Peru that are shown in the GIF file
below, and he argued that the spike of deaths in early 2021 was caused
by the vaccines because the spike roughly coincided with the rollout of
the first two doses in the oldest age groups.
[<a href=https://correlation-canada.org/covid-19-vaccine-associated-mortality-in-the-southern-hemisphere/>https://correlation-canada.org/covid-19-vaccine-associated-mortality-in-the-southern-hemisphere/</a>]
However a major weakness of his argument is that the spike in deaths
also occurred around the same time in younger age groups even though
younger age groups got vaccinated much later than older age groups:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-peru-age-groups.gif width=600>
</div>
<p>From the next plot which shows ASMR instead of the raw number of
deaths, you can see that the third hump is higher than the first hump in
unvaccinated people in ages 80+. But in ages 80+ about half of people
had already been vaccinated by the time of the third hump, so the total
height of the third hump among both vaccinated and unvaccinated people
is relatively low. But in ages 40-59 less than 10% of people had been
vaccinated by the time of the third hump, so the height of the hump is
similar among all people and unvaccinated people:</p>

Both COVID deaths and hospitalizations also have similar three-hump
pattern as all-cause deaths, and in ages 80+ the first hump is the
highest and the third hump is the lowest, but in ages 60-79 and 40-59
the third hump is higher than the first hump:</p>

<p>The CSV file for the record-level data was committed to GitHub by
Tade√°≈° Fryƒç√°k, but he was also one of the authors of a paper published
in May 2024 titled <span class="quote">"Does the healthy vaccinee bias
rule them all? Association of COVID-19 vaccination status and all-cause
mortality from an analysis of data from 2.2 million individual health
records"</span>:

The authors of the paper described two sets of record-level data which
only included about 2 million people in total, and not over 11 million
people like the new dataset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using a Freedom of Information request, we obtained data from two
health insurance houses (in the Czech Republic, health insurance is
compulsory and multiple health insurance houses provide the service).
Each line in the dataset corresponded to a unique individual and
included their sex, age, dates and types of all COVID vaccines, and (if
applicable), the date of death. When trying to find out whether there is
a difference between the baseline frailty of the groups, ACM is the most
telling parameter as it is not burdened with any possible
misclassification on the cause of death. For this reason, only ACM will
be considered in this study.</p>
<p>Each cooperating insurance company decided to blur the data slightly
to exclude the possibility of identification of any individual. The
first dataset provided by the Czech Business Insurance Company (CPZP)
comprises 1,362,924 individuals, i.e., approx. 13% of the Czech
population. It is by no means a fully representative sample of the Czech
population because the clients of CPZP tend to be younger than average.
However, the size of the cohort allows interesting analyses. The time
data were blurred to week and year. The other dataset provided by the
Professional Insurance Company (OZP) comprises 827,475 individuals,
representing another 8% of the Czech population, the time data were
blurred to month and year of events. The OZP dataset will serve for
validation of the results obtained from the larger CPZP dataset. In all,
we have complete data on mortality and vaccination of more than 2
million individuals over the entire period of 2021 and 2022. Both the
datasets are available at
<a href=https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/hve.><a
href="https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/hve"
class="uri">https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/hve</a>.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors observed the phenomenon where the mortality rate of
people with 2 doses shot up when the third dose was rolled out, but they
attributed it to the healthy vaccinee effect. Martin Neil and Norman
Fenton have hypothesized that the same phenomenon might be explained by
a classification delay which they call the <span class="quote">"cheap
trick"</span>, where deaths that occured within a certain number of
weeks after the third dose would've been classified under the second
dose. But because the authors of the Czech paper had access to the
record-level data which showed the dates of vaccination and death of
individual people, the authors could know for sure that the cheap trick
was not being used in the data. They included the following comments
about the plot shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-insurance-1.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Now, let us focus on the red panels, covering the <span
class="quote">"high-COVID"</span> period of October 2021-May 2022. In
that period, the Czech Republic recorded almost 10,000 COVID-related
deaths, which translates into an average of 40 deaths with/from COVID-19
per day. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-related deaths
should lead to an increase in the ratio of unvaccinated:vaccinated ACM.
However, the exact opposite happened. In all age groups, the ACM in the
cohort with completed primary course (yellow bars) more than doubled
compared to the low-COVID period, while the ACM of the unvaccinated
cohort rose only by a third. A sanity check with the same analysis
performed for the other dataset (OZP insurance company) yielded
consistent results (see Supplement S6). This paradoxical observation can
be caused by the fact that in the high-COVID period, vaccination by the
third dose was underway, which, again, led to a subselection of the
healthier group for booster dose vaccination, while infirm individuals
concentrated in the group <span class="quote">"primary course for more
than 2 months."</span></p>

<p>Kirsch included this comment in the file

<blockquote>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def dp(r, mrr):
...     return (r-1)/(r-mrr)

<p>I think that's probably the most conservative estimate: that Moderna
has an excess mortality ratio (EMR, which is R in the function above) of
3, and an absolute MRR of 1.5 per the Czech data.</p>
<p>This would mean that Pfizer has an MR vs a saline shot of 1.33, or a
33% increase in all cause mortality.</p>
<p>So if MRP = 1.3, then MRm=1.3*1.5=1.95</p>
<p>And if half the public got Pfizer and half got Moderna, we have an
excess ACM of 62%.</p>
<p>If Moderna is 1/4 of the doses given and has a 3X EMR, then Moderna
death numbers = Pfizer death numbers.</p>
<p>But only 75% of people are vaccinated so that there would be an
overall 46% increase in ACM in the group affected the most.</p>
<p>This corresponds of what the insurance data says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the code below I calculated a linear trend in mortality rate in
2013-2019 for each single year of age, I projected the trend to
2021-2022, and I multiplied the projected mortality rates by the
population estimates for each age in 2021 and 2022 to get the expected
number of deaths. But it gave me a total excess mortality of only about
17% in 2021-2022, which is less than half of Kirsch's 46% increase:</p>

<p>Kirsch said that 75% of people were vaccinated, but I don't know if
his figure is supposed to have included all ages or if it didn't include
children in the ages that generally didn't get vaccinated. Because if
you include all ages, then the total percentage of vaccinated people in
the record-level data is only about 64-65% in 2022 (which is similar to
OWID's figure of about 66% vaccinated people in 2022):</p>
