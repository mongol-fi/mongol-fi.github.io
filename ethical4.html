<p>Ethical Skeptic posted this plot of cancer incidence in England:
[<a href=https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1966911244859842912>https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1966911244859842912</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-1.png width=800>
</div>
<p>His plot has a massive drop in the incidence between the start and
end of 2019, but in the dataset he cited as his source, the incidence in
2019 is roughly flat:
[<a href=https://nhsd-ndrs.shinyapps.io/rcrd/>https://nhsd-ndrs.shinyapps.io/rcrd/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-14.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In this plot the age-standardized cancer incidence also remained
around the same level in 2018 and 2019:
[<a href=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06887/SN06887.pdf>https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06887/SN06887.pdf</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>I used WebPlotDigitizer to digitize the data in Ethical Skeptic's
plot. The points in his plot have irregular horizontal spacing, so I had
to click on each point manually to extract the data correctly:
[<a href=https://automeris.io/wpd/>https://automeris.io/wpd/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-11.png width=700>
</div>
<p>ES seems to have calculated the number of people aged 65 and above
through a circuitious method, where he multiplied the yearly population
estimates of England with the yearly proportion of people aged 65 and
above:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-15.png width=600>
</div>
<p>I tried to replicate his methodology, so I took yearly population
estimates from a page at Statista titled <span class="quote">"Population
of England from 1971 to 2023"</span>:
<a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/975956/population-of-england/.><a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/975956/population-of-england/"
class="uri">https://www.statista.com/statistics/975956/population-of-england/</a>.</a>
I used 2023 estimates for 2024 and 2025, but I'm not sure if for example
ES used a linear projection of the 2022 and 2023 population sizes as the
population size for 2024. I multiplied the population estimates by the
proportion of people aged 65 and above in England from here (where I
used the 2024 proportion for 2025):
<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/explore-local-statistics/indicators/percentage-of-the-population-aged-65-plus>https://www.ons.gov.uk/explore-local-statistics/indicators/percentage-of-the-population-aged-65-plus</a>
(<span class="quote">"Line chart &gt; Change areas &gt; Other areas &gt;
All countries &gt; England &gt; Download line chart data
(CSV)"</span>).</p>
<p>The result I got was close to the yearly population estimate of ages
65+ returned by Nomis, apart from the years 2023 and 2024:
[<a href=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestsyoala>https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestsyoala</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-5.png width=550>
</div>
<p>Then in order to calculate the yellow line in the next plot, I
multiplied the monthly rates in Ethical Skeptic's plot by the yearly
number of people aged 65 and above, and I divided the result by
100,000.</p>
<p>I downloaded the rapid cancer registration data from here:
<a href=https://nhsd-ndrs.shinyapps.io/rcrd/.><a
href="https://nhsd-ndrs.shinyapps.io/rcrd/"
class="uri">https://nhsd-ndrs.shinyapps.io/rcrd/</a>.</a> I used the
version of the data adjusted for the number of working days per month,
because the unadjusted version gave me a much poorer fit to Ethical
Skeptic's plot, so he probably used the adjusted data. Then I took a
backwards moving average of the data where the window extended up to 5
months backwards, but for example the window extended only 1 month
backwards in February 2018.</p>
<p>I was able to replicate the values in Ethical Skeptic's closely in
2018. But he seems to have manually altered the y-axis values so that he
shifted them downwards in 2019 to 2022, and he shifted them upwards in
2024 and 2025. There's a particularly large downwards shift in 2019, so
that the yearly average number of diagnoses drops by about 13% between
2018 and 2019, even though in the real data it increases by about
1%:</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure that ES manually falsified the data. He has not
documented his methodology precisely enough that other people could
reproduce his work exactly, which also makes it difficult for other
people to bust him falsifying the data. But the 13% drop between 2018
and 2019 seems completely unrealistic, and it's inconsistent with the
real data, but it is consistent with Ethical Skeptic's history of
falsifying data. I have previously busted him outright falsifying data
in his SV40 cancer wave plot, plot for cancer deaths in ages 0-54, plot
for MCD to UCD cancer ratio, and plot for excess deaths in ages 0-4.</p>
<p>Some points in his plot have irregular horizontal spacing, which
might be if he somehow manually moved the points around in a GUI, so
that he ended up not only moving the points vertically but also
horizontally:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-englandincidence-10.png width=350>
</div>
<p>The next plot shows that I found anomalous features next to two pairs
of months that had irregular horizontal spacing. It's also weird how
there's several segments of months in 2019 and 2020 that look almost
like straight lines, but there are sudden discontinuities in slope
before or after the lines, which is anomalous for a moving average. In
the real data there are only two clear discontinuities in the slope,
which are between March and April of 2020 because the incidence dropped
dramatically in April, and between September and October of 2020 because
April 2020 fell out of the window of the moving average:</p>

class="uri">https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestsyoala</a>.</a> The
age-standardized incidence increased by about 6% between 2021 and 2024,
but it's partially because the number of diagnoses was lower than usual
in early 2021, and if you compare 2024 to 2022 instead of 2021, then the
incidence increased by only about 3%:</p>

<p>The website of the NHS says: <span class="quote">"The Rapid Cancer
Registration Data contains proxy tumour registrations and some

quicker, indicative source of cancer data compared to the National

<blockquote>
<p>This document outlines the main features of the data to be aware of
when interpreting the Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>across all cancer types included approximately 12.1% of cases are
missing and 6.0% of cases are included erroneously or with incorrect
cancer type or diagnosis date (when compared to <span
class="quote">'Gold Standard'</span> registration data for 2018
data)</li>
<li>these figures vary strongly with cancer site. Broadly, more common
cancers (particularly breast and prostate cancer) perform best and less
common cancers (particularly bone and soft tissue and cancers of unknown
primary) perform worst</li>
<li>non-melanoma skin cancer (ICD-10 C44) tumours are excluded from the

<p>The text in Ethical Skeptic's plot says that <span
class="quote">"Weekly cancer death rates are up above the 2014 - 2019
regression baseline"</span>. The way he appears to have accomplished the
feat was to first fake his regression line, and then to manually move
points upwards when the points happened to fall below his fake
regression line.</p>
<p>In the plot above, my black line otherwise matches Ethical Skeptic's
blue line, except there are clusters of weeks in 2022 and 2023 where my
line is much lower. I think it's because ES manually shifted points that
were below his dashed baseline upwards. His plot has only 4 points in
2022 and 2023 that are below his dashed baseline, but my plot has 12
points.</p>
<p>Ethical Skeptic's blue line is also slightly higher than my black
line from 2020 onwards. I took data for 2014-2019 from the same CDC
dataset that ES uses in his plots.

I took data from 2020 onwards from CDC WONDER, but I can't think of any
explanation for why my number of deaths from CDC WONDER would be
slightly lower than Ethical Skeptic's number of deaths, because I just
did a simple query for weekly deaths with underlying cause malignant
neoplasms (C00-C97). So ES might have manually applied a slight upwards
adjustment to all weeks in 2020-2023.</p>

<p>The paper he linked looked at cancer incidence within the first year

for relative to unvaccinated people.

SARS-CoV-2 infection:</p>

<p>The vast majority of the population of South Korea is vaccinated, so
if vaccines caused a 27% increase in the incidence of cancer in
vaccinated people, you'd expect the overall population of Korea to also
have a major increase in the incidence of cancer above the pre-COVID
trend. However the age-standardized cancer incidence in the overall
population of South Korea roughly fell on the pre-COVID trend in 2021
and 2022:
[<a href=https://e-crt.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4143/crt.2025.264>https://e-crt.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4143/crt.2025.264</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-korea-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>(The rates in the plot above are age-standardized rates calculated
using a world standard population, so the rates are much lower than
crude mortality rates or age-standardized rates where the Korean
population is used as the standard population, because the Korean
population has a high percentage of elderly people compared to the world
population.)</p>
<p>The likely explanation for why vaccinated people had a higher
incidence of cancer was that vaccinated people are more likely to get
screened for cancer than unvaccinated people, because unvaccinated
people tend to be more hesitant to interact with medical services in
general.</p>
<p>In a Japanese study unvaccinated women were much less likely than
vaccinated women to get screening for breast cancer. The authors wrote
that when they did a Poisson regression model adjusted for age,
socioeconomic variables, and health-related behavior traits, <span
class="quote">"Individuals who remained unvaccinated due to health
concerns (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.29-0.77, p = 0.003) and for other unspecified reasons (IRR =
0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.86, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly less inclined
to opt for screening when compared to their fully vaccinated
counterparts."</span>

<p>A Canadian paper from 2024 said: <span class="quote">"Unvaccinated

<p>Part of the reason why some types of cancer had a higher HR than
other types might be that some types of cancer are being screened more
commonly. David Gorski wrote:

<li>Lung cancer</li>

<p>What do these cancers have in common? It helps if you remember that
this is a South Korean study. Why? Most readers know that in the US we
routinely screen for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer in the US,
with high risk populations (e.g., smokers) also screened for lung cancer
(although uptake of that screening is low). So what about gastric and
thyroid cancer. First, gastric cancer is more common in Asian
populations, which is why Japan and Korea both have active screening
programs for gastric cancer. In the past barium studies were used, but
now it's endoscopy. So, unlike the case in the US, in South Korea
<a href=https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2022/12/stomach-cancer-asians.html>gastric
cancer is a screen-detected cancer</a>.</p>

<p>The authors seem to have referred to AstraZeneca or other non-mRNA
vaccines incorrectly as <span class="quote">"cDNA vaccines"</span>.
Supplementary file 1 says: <span class="quote">"Regarding vaccine types
between the first and second vaccinations, 1,928,363 individuals
(81.02%) were treated with mRNA vaccines only, 333,698 individuals
(14.02%) were given cDNA vaccines only, and 117,967 individuals (4.96%)
were administered with heterologous vaccinations in the COVID-19
vaccinated cohort (Table S2)."</span></p>
<p>There is no approved cDNA vaccine for COVID in Korea, even though
there have been clinical trials for the Inovio INO-4800 and Genexine
GX-19N cDNA vaccines, but they wouldn't account for 14% of total
subjects in the cancer study.</p>
<p>Another Korean paper said: <span class="quote">"As of September 25,
2022, 128,710,064 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered: BNT162b2
(62.9%), mRNA-1273 (19.5%), ChAdOx1 (15.8%), Ad26.COV2.S (1.2%),
NVX-CoV2373 (0.6%) and GBP510 (&lt; 0.1%)."</span>

So if AstraZeneca accounted for about 16% of doses in South Korea, and
about 14% of subjects in the cancer study were in the cDNA-only group,
then it's likely that the cDNA group included AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>Table S3 has a list of vaccine brands that were administered for
booster doses, which includes only three vaccine brands (Pfizer
BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and AstraZeneca ChAdOx10). There's only a
couple of doses of AstraZeneca listed in the table, because AstraZeneca
was generally only administered for primary course doses. The paper
didn't show what the distribution of vaccine brands was for primary
course doses.</p>

<p>Uncle John used an age-standardized incidence rate from the website
of the Korean National Cancer Center, which was 522.7 cases per 100,000
person-years in 2022, so it's about 4.3 cases per 10,000 people per a
30-day period.
[<a href=https://www.cancerdata.re.kr/surveillance/en/data?menuId=40>https://www.cancerdata.re.kr/surveillance/en/data?menuId=40</a>]</p>
<p>I didn't find a crude incidence rate anywhere from the website, but
in a paper which used data from the same source, the crude incidence
rate in 2022 was about 550.2 cases per 100,000 person-years, which is
about 4.52 cases per 10,000 people per 30 days.
[<a href=https://e-crt.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4143/crt.2025.264>https://e-crt.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4143/crt.2025.264</a>]
Supplementary file 2 of the Korean study says that the study only
included people aged 20 and above, but about 84.1% of the Korean
population is aged 20 and above in the 2022 population estimates, so if
you divide 4.52 with 0.841, you get a total incidence of about 5.4 for
ages 20 and above. (I didn't exclude cases in children from the
numerator, but they account for only a tiny part of the total incidence.
The population included in the cancer study consisted of people from
Seoul, but I didn't take into account that the age composition of Seoul
might be different from the rest of Korea.)</p>
<p>But anyway, cancer takes time to develop, but the image above shows
that even during the first month of follow-up, vaccinated people already
had a much higher incidence of cancer than unvaccinated people.
Supplementary file 2 says that the follow-up period started from the day
after the primary series was completed, and not the day of the first
dose. But still, most people got the second dose within a few weeks from
the first dose, so if the difference in incidence during the first month
of follow-up would be explained by vaccines causing cancer, then the
vaccines would have to be causing super fast-acting turbo cancer.</p>
<hr />
<p>A paper about cancer screening behavior in Korea said: <span
class="quote">"In the city with the highest cancer screening
participation rate, factors such as oral health, physical activity,
breakfast habits, and past smoking history were all associated with
higher participation. This finding aligns with the conclusion of a
previous study that identified a correlation between healthy dietary
habits, physical activity motivation, and cancer screening participation
[35]. A similar trend has been observed in Lithuania, where factors such
as the consumption of fresh vegetables, physical activity, and
abstinence from alcohol are associated with higher participation in the
national breast cancer screening program for women aged 50–69 [36]. In
addition, a previous study of cancer screening activity in adults aged
50 years and older in the United States reported that healthy
lifestyles, such as physical activity and smoking cessation, are
associated with cancer screening behaviors [27]."</span>

<p>At first I didn't understand why Table S2 showed that the subjects
were not matched by income level:

<div>
<img src=i/ethical-korea-8.png width=680>
</div>
<p>But apparently the matching was done based on the insurance level,
and the income level was estimated based on the insurance level.
Supplementary file 2 says: <span class="quote">"The following covariates
were considered: age, sex, insurance levels, Charlson comorbidity index
(CCI) scores, and prior COVID-19 infection (history of SARS-CoV-2
infection). Insurance levels (recipients of medical aid, grades 1-5,
grades 6-10, grades 11-15, and grades 16-20) were defined based on the
National Health Insurance premium, which was used as a proxy for income
since it is proportional to monthly income and includes both earnings
and capital gains."</span>

likely remains major residual confounding for the level of

10,470 deaths with UCD COVID in 2025. There were 10 or more deaths for

<p>Ethical Skeptic's image says: <span class="quote">"Current U.S. life
expectancy for the average 80-year old = 78.4 years"</span>. I don't
know if he made a typo, because the life expectancy at age 80 should be
more than 80. In the 2023 US life table, the remaining life expectancy
for age 80 is about 9.3 years.

<p>When I took the number of deaths in 2023 from CDC WONDER and I took
mid-year resident population estimates in 2023 from the vintage 2024
release by the Census Bureau, I also got a remaining life expectancy of
about 9.3 years at age 80:</p>
