<p>The website of Cure Guardian says: <span class="quote">"Cure Guardian
was founded by Matthew Nachtrab and the shareholders of Cassava Sciences
who witnessed an unprecedented attack by short sellers to stop their FDA
approved clinical trials for their drug Simufilam. The short sellers
were successful in this campaign by leveraging an attorney (Jordan
Thomas) to walk them into the SEC and DOJ and kickstart investigations.
These outsiders should not be able to weaponize the government and
institution investigative divisions against researchers and
companies."</span>
[<a href=https://cureguardian.org/>https://<wbr>cureguardian.<wbr>org/<wbr></a>]
ScienceGuardians also posted a long tweet about Cassava.
[<a href=https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1937339434447278260>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>SciGuardians/<wbr>status/<wbr>1937339434447278260</a>]</p>
<p>In October 2024 Nachtrab showed that he held about 2.7 million shares
of Cassava's stock, which were worth about 75 million USD, which made up
about a third of the total value of his portfolio.
[<a href=https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1848772514610106719>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>MattNachtrab/<wbr>status/<wbr>1848772514610106719</a>]
Cassava had no products on the market, but they were developing an
Alzheimer's drug called Simufilam. In November 2024 Cassava announced
that they had stopped developing Simufilam because its phase 3 trial had
failed, so as a result their stock price crashed from about 30 USD to 3
USD, and it has remained around the range of 2 to 3 USD since then. In
April 2025 Matt Nachtrab tweeted: <span class="quote">"I liquidated all
of my $sava. I have lost all confidence in the team."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1910351007730618455>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>MattNachtrab/<wbr>status/<wbr>1910351007730618455</a>]
So he likely lost more than 50 million USD.</p>
<p>In early 2021 after Cassava reported promising results in their
Simufilam trial, the value of their stock increased about 10-fold.
Cassava had a market capitalization of about 2 billion USD, even though
they had no product on the market, zero revenue, and only a few
employees. Cassava was a high-volatility stock that was hyped up by meme
stock traders on Reddit.
[<a href=https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>nasdaq.<wbr>com/<wbr>articles/<wbr>cassava-<wbr>sciences-<wbr>can-<wbr>recover-<wbr>despite-<wbr>harsh-<wbr>allegations-<wbr>2021-<wbr>09-<wbr>21</a>]</p>
<p>In August 2021 a law firm that represents SEC whistleblowers
submitted a citizen petition to the FDA, where they requested the FDA to
halt the Simufilam trials because of misconduct.
[<a href=https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0001>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>regulations.<wbr>gov/<wbr>document/<wbr>FDA-<wbr>2021-<wbr>P-<wbr>0930-<wbr>0001</a>]
Cassava's stock price dropped by about 50% after the petition, and two
days after the petition was submitted, the law firm disclosed that their
clients held a short position in Cassava's stock.
[<a href=https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>nasdaq.<wbr>com/<wbr>articles/<wbr>cassava-<wbr>sciences-<wbr>can-<wbr>recover-<wbr>despite-<wbr>harsh-<wbr>allegations-<wbr>2021-<wbr>09-<wbr>21</a>]
After the petition, Elizabeth Bik and other people at PubPeer began to
look into Cassava, and the law firm later submitted a supplement to the
petition which incorporated discoveries by Bik.
[<a href=https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0023>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>regulations.<wbr>gov/<wbr>document/<wbr>FDA-<wbr>2021-<wbr>P-<wbr>0930-<wbr>0023</a>]</p>
<p>In November 2021 a group of four authors submitted another report
about Cassava to the FDA.
[<a href=https://www.cassavafraud.com>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>cassavafraud.<wbr>com</a>]
A Powerpoint presentation which accompanied the report said: <span
class="quote">"The authors of this presentation and the associated
letter to FDA hold stock and options positions that may benefit from a
decline in Cassava Sciences' stock price."</span>
[<a href=https://www.cassavafraud.com/docs/SAVAReport_Deck_2021_11_03.pdf>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>cassavafraud.<wbr>com/<wbr>docs/<wbr>SAVAReport_<wbr>Deck_<wbr>2021_<wbr>11_<wbr>03.<wbr>pdf</a>]
In a press release where Cassava responded to the report, they used the
term <span class="quote">"perpetrators"</span> to refer to the authors
of the report, which is the same term that ScienceGuardians uses to
refer to contributors at PubPeer.
[<a href=https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-files-lawsuit-against-perpetrators-short-and>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>cassavasciences.<wbr>com/<wbr>news-<wbr>releases/<wbr>news-<wbr>release-<wbr>details/<wbr>cassava-<wbr>sciences-<wbr>files-<wbr>lawsuit-<wbr>against-<wbr>perpetrators-<wbr>short-<wbr>and</a>]</p>
<p>In November 2021 a hedge fund called Quintessential Capital
Management published a report about Cassava, where QCM wrote that their
<span class="quote">"main activity consists in identifying,
investigating and exposing fraud and criminal conduct in public
companies around the world"</span>, and QCM wrote that they had
previously conducted campaigns which led to the collapse of several
public companies.
[<a href=https://assets.empirefinancialresearch.com/uploads/2021/11/Cassava-Report-FINAL-3-R-1.pdf>https://<wbr>assets.<wbr>e<wbr>m<wbr>p<wbr>i<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>f<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>a<wbr>n<wbr>c<wbr>i<wbr>a<wbr>l<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>c<wbr>h<wbr>.<wbr>com/<wbr>uploads/<wbr>2021/<wbr>11/<wbr>Cassava-<wbr>Report-<wbr>FINAL-<wbr>3-<wbr>R-<wbr>1.<wbr>pdf</a>]
The report included a disclosure that <span class="quote">"QCM is SHORT
the stock of Cassava Sciences (SAVA)"</span>. QCM wrote: <span
class="quote">"We are a commercial enterprise, and we work for profit.
However, we firmly believe in the moral character of our work, which has
the effect of removing dishonest companies from the markets."</span> I
don't know if QCM was also behind the original citizen petition, or if
they decided to target Cassava because of the information that was
uncovered after the petition was released.</p>
<p>The report by QCM said: <span class="quote">"A number of forensic
experts including, Dr. Elizabeth Bik and consultants hired by QCM, have
systematically reviewed the documents and confirmed the allegations,
pointing out that Cassava and Dr. Wang could have easily disputed the
claims simply releasing the originals of the images in question (for the
record: they haven't)."</span> But it's not clear if QCM compensated Bik
for her research.</p>
<p>In December 2021 Leonid Schneider wrote: <span class="quote">"This is
probably the world premiere of data integrity sleuths seeking to earn
money with manipulating the stock market by exposing research fraud. At
least two sets of them are now short-trading Cassava stocks, betting on
the stock value to drop as they reveal lies and fabrications this
company submitted in scientific journals and FDA."</span>
[<a href=https://forbetterscience.com/2021/12/15/cassava-fraud-and-alzheimers-capitalism/>https://<wbr>forbetterscience.<wbr>com/<wbr>2021/<wbr>12/<wbr>15/<wbr>cassava-<wbr>fraud-<wbr>and-<wbr>alzheimers-<wbr>capitalism/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>So that explains why Matt Nachtrab would claim that the purpose of
people at PubPeer is to game the stock market, even though his claim
seems to reflect his personal experience with Cassava, and there are
likely not too many other instances where the stock price of a company
was considerably influenced by comments at PubPeer.</p>

<p>Joe Sansone wrote that the Alliance of Indigenous Nations issued the
declaration <span class="quote">"after reviewing hundreds of pages of
evidence from my current case, including scientific papers and legal
briefs filed in the Florida court system, as well other scientific
papers"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/exclusive-breaking-news-alliance>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>josephsansone.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>exclusive-<wbr>breaking-<wbr>news-<wbr>alliance</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration by AIN looks similar to the complaint in Sansone's
court case in Florida, because the declaration features expert opinions
by Francis Boyle, Ana Mihalcea, Andrew Zywiec, Paul Alexander, and Rima
Laibow, who all provided testimony to Sansone's case. 3 out of 11 pages
of the declaration were dedicated to the expert opinion of Ana Mihalcea,
who said that vaccines contain quantum dots, nanorobots, microrobots,
and hydrogel. In 2023 Ana Mihalcea gave an address to AIN on the threat
of nanotechnology.
[<a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-address-to-the-alliance-of-indigenous>https://<wbr>anamihalceamdphd.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>my-<wbr>address-<wbr>to-<wbr>the-<wbr>alliance-<wbr>of-<wbr>indigenous</a>]</p>
<p>Andrew Zywiec was called a <span class="quote">"tribal
practicioner"</span> in AIN's declaration. He looks like he is fully
white, but he claims that he is <span class="quote">"literally a tribal
physician with Crow Nation"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/AndrewZywiecMD/status/1976798052456550520>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>AndrewZywiecMD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1976798052456550520</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration had no author listed, but I suspect one of its
authors was Joe Sansone. The declaration was signed by <span
class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span> and by two other people whose
names are not legible:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-2.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>You can tell the declaration is the real deal, because it features
this seal by <span class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-9.webp width=200>
</div>
<p>A Leaping Ram is the white sovereign citizen guru Glenn Bogue, who
falsely claims to be a Native American, and who also calls himself <span
class="quote">"Spirit Warrior"</span>. He appears to have first started
to claim he was a <span class="quote">"non-status Métis"</span> around
the year 2018 (where the term <span class="quote">"non-status"</span>
means that he doesn't have formal Indian status under the Indian Act).

He is a member of the Kinakwii Private Sovereign Nation, which is a fake
online Indian tribe that charges 300 CAD per year for membership.

<p>At time 17:21 in the video panel with AIN, Alfred Lambremont Webre
said: <span class="quote">"John is the leader and coordinator of the
Alliance of Indigenous Nations that your humble servant is part of,
along with others."</span> So apparently Webre is also a member of
AIN.</p>
<p>At time 26:49, Webre talked about his book titled <span
class="quote">"In The Future, Will The United States Of America Break Up
Into Many Regions?"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Spirit
Warrior - Glenn Bogue, the Attorney General of the Alliance of
Indigenous Nations - has contributed a part - uh, extended part - to the
book."</span></p>
<p>At time 30:49, Bogue said: <span class="quote">"Those who have
studied the history of our solar system would quickly, uh, consede the
fact that the Earth used to be outside of Mars - between Mars and
Jupiter - because of something called Bode's mathematical law."</span>
And he said that at the time the earth shone like a blue jewel to
spaceships going by from other planets and other solar systems. He said
the name for the earth in ancient languages was Gop. And he said that
the earth moved to its current location around 400,000 BC, because one
of the moons of Planet X crashed into the earth. He said that before it
the east coast of Canada and the west coast of Europe used to be part of
a single continent called Pangea, which was populated by the Solutrean
people. (Which I presume is meant to explain why there would be white
indigenous people like himself on the east coast of Canada.)</p>
<p>At time 39:18, Bogue said: <span class="quote">"This is the ancient
indigenous knowledge that - number one, a female scientist changed the
ovum of an ape into human beings by putting in a sperm from their Planet
X there, and then one of their gods, Enki, the son of man, had sex with
the two daughters of Eve, creating <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Now, I will
hold fast to that, until somebody can come up to me and disprove the
National Geographic DNA study, or the ancient texts."</span> At time
50:11, he said that the event when the female scientist from Planet X
created humans took place 200,000 years ago, and that she specifically
inserted sperm from Planet X into the egg of a bonobo. (But then were
the Solutreans who lived on Pangea 400,000 years ago not humans? Or were
they part of another earlier creation?)</p>
<p>At time 1:31:07, Webre addressed the panelists, and he said: <span
class="quote">"What I'd like to do is advise all of the participants,
who are leaders of Turtle Island indigenous nations - that on behalf of
the tribunal, we'll be inviting each of the four of you - and I'm
putting this - to be attendees at The First International Earth
Conference on Extraterrestrial Genocide, and Successful and Mutually
Advantageous Planetary Rescue, Positive Alliance, and Integration with
Homo Martis Terris. They are the human Martian civilization. And it's
all set out there. We're in the process of arranging an international
conference, uh, to ally the positive human civilization with the
positive Martian civilization. We have the information that there are
about 1 million, uh, Homo Martis Terris, or human Martian civilization
members. They're our genetic cousins. They're a bit more advanced than
earthling humans, and a bit more ethical, living under the surface of
Mars. And that's a conference, and I'll be sending each of you
invitations."</span></p>
<p>Webre's Martian conference was part of his series of tribunals called
the <span class="quote">"Natural and Common Law Tribunal for Public
Health &amp; Justice"</span>. Webre's source for his information about
the Martians was Andrew Basiago, who is supposed to have met one of the
Martians when he traveled back in time to 1970:

<p>Alfred Lambremont Webre coined the term <span
class="quote">"exopolitics"</span>, which he defines as <span
class="quote">"the science of relations among intelligent civilizations
in the multiverse"</span>. He claims that he worked as a futurist at the
Stanford Research Institute, and that he was the director of the SRI's
<span class="quote">"1977 Jimmy Carter White House Extraterrestrial
Communication Study"</span>, but the study might be his invention,
because almost all references to the study I found came from Webre.
Webre also claims that extraterrestrials coordinated a meeting between
himself and Jimmy Carter on a spaceship in 1977.

<p>The World Bank whistleblower Karen Hudes used to claim that the
global banking system was covertly controlled by a cone-headed race of
hominins called the <em>Homo capensis</em>, but she later renounced the
theory, and she said it was disinformation that was fed to her by Edward
Spencer and Alfred Lambremont Webre.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KS1-_qiBQ&t=9m9s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=F2KS1-_<wbr>qiBQ&amp;<wbr>t=9m9s</a>,

The <em>Homo capensis</em> theory is reminiscent of Webre's theory that
there is a race of Martian humans called Homo Martis Terris.</p>
<p>In 2001 Webre founded the Institute for Cooperation in Space together
with Steven Greer's whistleblower Carol Rosin.
[<a href=https://isgp-studies.com/coast-to-coast-am-radio-on-ufos-aliens-and-conspiracy>https://<wbr>isgp-<wbr>studies.<wbr>com/<wbr>coast-<wbr>to-<wbr>coast-<wbr>am-<wbr>radio-<wbr>on-<wbr>ufos-<wbr>aliens-<wbr>and-<wbr>conspiracy</a>]
Webre was the <span class="quote">"congressional coordinator"</span> for
Greer's Disclosure Project. The co-director of Webre's institute was
Daniel Sheehan, who worked as a lawyer for Greer and the alien abduction
guru John Mack, who were both funded by Laurance Rockefeller. The board
of Webre's institute also inluded the New Age guru Brian O'Leary, who
was the director of a free energy organization called New Energy
Movement, whose board included Webre and Rosin.

The European offshoot of New Energy Movement is called GlobalBEM, which
is operated by the Dutch people who organized the Secret Space Program
conferences, and who now do video and audio production for Catherine
Austin Fitts and who run Solari Europa.

Webre's co-director Daniel Sheehan claims to have served in the special
forces in the 1960s. In 1980 he and Jim Garrison co-founded the Christic
Institute, which was financed by the New World Foundation whose chair
was Hillary Clinton, who visited Laurance Rockefeller's ranch in 1995
where she was briefed about Greer's Disclosure Project.
[<a href=http://www.presidentialufo.com/old_site/laurance_rockefeller_obituary.htm>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>presidentialufo.<wbr>com/<wbr>old_<wbr>site/<wbr>laurance_<wbr>rockefeller_<wbr>obituary.<wbr>htm</a>]
Sheehan's institute also received about 600,000 USD worth of grants from
the Rockefeller-linked Tides Foundation in 2004-2013. Webre's institute
was financed by the Threshold Foundation which was part of the Tides
Foundation. In 1987 Sheehan became the chief counsel for the Jesuit
national headquarters in the United States. In 1994 Sheehan and Jim
Garrison set up the State of the World Forum, whose visitors have
included David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>Laurance Rockefeller and John Mack were radical environmentalists
before they entered the UFO field. Before Webre became a UFO guy, he
worked as an environmental lawyer for the New York Environmental
Protection Agency and the Ford Foundation's Public Interest
Environmental Law Program. Before RFK Jr. entered the anti-vaccine psyop
industry, he also worked as an environmental lawyer in New York.</p>

Alfred Lambremont Webre was a judge in Sacha Stone's fake international
tribunal called the International Tribunal for Natural Justice. During
an ITNJ hearing in April 2020 where Webre played the role of a judge, he
declared that SARS-CoV-2 was not a virus but an exosome, which meant
that lockdown orders were null and void under both national and common

He also did an interview with AIN, where he said he was working on
setting up the World Hereditary Council, which would hold tribunals
where indigenous people would testify on issues like the crimes of the
Vatican, and he said that he wanted to collaborate with AIN in
conducting the tribunals.
[<a href=https://sachastone.com/2024/03/06/ain-interview/>https://<wbr>sachastone.<wbr>com/<wbr>2024/<wbr>03/<wbr>06/<wbr>ain-<wbr>interview/<wbr></a>,
1:58:07] At time 59:19, Sacha Stone said: <span class="quote">"But the
problem of course is the so-called mRNA interventionism right now, and
the fact that human biology is so saturated with graphene oxide, and
hydrogels, and all sorts of wicked chemistry. And I say wicked
chemistry, because by my understanding and my reckoning, it is precisely
the source code of the devil - equates to the synthetic
molecule."</span> At time 1:02:09, a lady who was featured in the video
said: <span class="quote">"I can only say, I am just so moved by your
words, all of them. They are so pure and from the heart."</span> And she
said: <span class="quote">"You're like the Christ himself, walking
around the earth. That's how I see. And certainly I feel that essence
and power, having met him myself when I was two."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>During an interview with Alfred Lambremont Webre in 2024, Glenn Bogue
said: <span class="quote">"I suspect that Enki - I know the man who took
Enki's trust fund from Vancouver to Beijing in 2000, just before the
COVID patents happened according to Dr. David Martin - and we got
halfway over the Pacific Ocean, he opened up this book - he's a courier,
right, he's a professional courier - he has, goes to the men's bathroom,
you know, whatever, has a quick peek - it's in the trillions as the
wealth left from San Francisco into Vancouver - and then left over to
Beijing. And now Beijing is set up to destroy - to destroy North
America. Which is the original home of the Black Empire in the Colorado
Grand Canyon. There are temples, pyramids to Isis and Osiris, in the
Grand Canyon. We're not allowed to go there. There have been spaceships
- single-pilot spaceships - from the war in Orion - are there in caves,
in the Grand Canyon. The black-headed people came out of the Grand
Canyon Empire, and appeared in Ireland, which is the outcrop of
Atlantis. Gaelic is ancient, um, Sanskrit language, that became ancient
Swedish. And from Sweden over to Tibet. That's why Swedish names are on
Tibet temples."</span>

<p>At time 35:32, Bogue now also said that when the female scientist
came from Planet X to create humans, she carved the face on Mars on her
way to the earth: <span class="quote">"Her name was Ninmah. And Ninmah
came to the Earth. She was the greatest biologist they had. The men
couldn't figure out how to get this ape thing to become a miner, you
know. You know, a mineral miner in Ethiopia. So they brought Ninmah from
Planet X, and en route she carved the face on Mars, as an ancient god.
That's a complicated story. One of their kings died there, and, so, uh.
She does the monument, comes to Ethiopia, creates <em>Homo
sapiens</em>."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:06:42, Bogue said that the ancient Egyptian texts state
that on the 14th and 28th day of her moon cycle, the woman produces a
very special monoatomic atom called the Ormus molecule. He said that
creation of the molecule requires two substances, which are seawater
fish and wine, because seawater fish contains precious metals with a
high atomic spin, and because the grapevine was brought to the earth
from Planet X for the purpose of extracting precious metals from the
soil. And he said that <span class="quote">"in a science journal
magazine in 2005, they proved that the high-spin Ormus molecule does
three things: it repairs DNA damage, it raises the intelligence of
stupid there - like Fred Flintstone, you know what I'm talking about -
and, and, it opens the stargate."</span> And he said: <span
class="quote">"So I happened to contact a guy in New York, who was doing
a trampoline display at a health show. He was in, uh, uh, Arizona,
making these trampolines. And I knew that Einstein said, if you could
move the body against gravity, and let it come down safely, you would
put the cells into what's called a dry pack. You would put the female
clitoris - which is the cosmic trigger of the skene glands - S-K-E-N-E -
of the female that produces massive amounts of ejaculate. Only 10% of
women can ejaculate. Because they haven't been taught. There's not many
courses running around on female ejaculate."</span></p>

In 2020 Rima Laibow was a judge in Webre's 5G tribunal, where the
tribunal ordered a ban on 5G, all vaccines, lockdown measures, and
aspartame, and the tribunal sentenced Elon Musk to 25 years in prison,
and Bill Gates and George Soros to a life in prison.

<p>I now identified the second person whose signature was included in
AIN's vaccine declaration. He is Lord Frederick Stewart, who is an
ambassador to a Papuan conman called King David:

<p>King David established a ponzi scheme called U-Vistract in the 1990s,
where he promised his investors a 100% interest rate per month. After
his scheme collapsed, he fled the authorities to his home island of
Bougainville, and he declared himself to be the king of a new nation he
established in his hometown.

<p>One of the nations that signed the AIN treaty was the <span

Lambremont Webre:

<p>When I googled for a combination of the phrases <span
class="quote">"Taina Ke"</span> and <span class="quote">"Webre"</span>
in double quotes, there were only 3 results, which were a PDF for the
AIN treaty, and 2 posts from Webre's blog (where in both posts the
phrase <span class="quote">"Taina Ke"</span> appeared in a link to a
video Webre did with AIN). <span class="quote">"Taina-Ke"</span> is a
common term which means the land of the Taino, and the flag shown next
to Webre's signature is the common flag of the Taino people. Webre
claims he has a small amount of Native American DNA, which he says might
have come from the Taino because his mother was a Cuban.

But I doubt any Taino people actually appointed Webre as their
representative.</p>

<p>Donald Netolitzky has written a series papers about the sovereign
citizen movement in Canada. In one of the papers he wrote the following
about Glenn Bogue:
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald-Netolitzky/publication/340026805_Enjoy_the_Silence_Pseudolaw_at_the_Supreme_Court_of_Canada>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>researchgate.<wbr>net/<wbr>profile/<wbr>Donald-<wbr>Netolitzky/<wbr>publication/<wbr>340026805_<wbr>Enjoy_<wbr>the_<wbr>Silence_<wbr>Pseudolaw_<wbr>at_<wbr>the_<wbr>Supreme_<wbr>Court_<wbr>of_<wbr>Canada</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the OPCA concepts advanced by Bogue in AC 37380 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aboriginal people (including those of African descent who
self-identify as <span class="quote">"Moors"</span>)[219] are only
subject to a separate legal system in equity administered by an
aboriginal Métis decision-maker.</li>
<li>The 1613 <em>Two Row Wampum Treaty</em> has supraconstitutional
status and permits radical revision of Aboriginal status and
rights.</li>
<li>The <span class="quote">"Aboriginal Law of Ma'at"</span> and Métis
matrilineal authority from Egypt (Ma'at is an ancient Egyptian goddess)
has supraconstitutional status.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample passage illustrates the highly unusual and unorthodox
terminology and concepts in Bogue's arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the Metis Clan Grandmothers trace their land ownership via
the female mitochondria trail back through Egypt to Sumer, she has the
historic right to have jurisdiction over her children.</p>
<p>The Law of Ma'at is the earliest known version of Natural Justice or
the Law of Equity. The Sovereign Non-Status Aboriginals and Metis still
have a right to that ancient law via S. 35, since the SCC held in
<em>Delgamuukw</em> that S. 35 enshrines their existing rights, but does
not define them. One of those rights is to trace back to Natural Justice
and the Maxims of Equity that existed prior to the 1881 <span
class="quote">'merger'</span> of Law and Equity.[220]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bogue sought leave to appeal two Ontario Court of Appeal decisions,
costs of $500,000.00, and argued that five additional actions conducted
by Bogue also be joined and heard together with the AC 37380 application
since <span class="quote">"all have Sovereign Jurisdiction of the Metis
Nation as their main issue."</span>[221]</p>
<p>The Law Society Tribunal has concluded Bogue lacks capacity to meet
his obligations as a lawyer due to mental illness.[222] He had been
ordered to undergo psychiatric examination.[223] Bogue, <span
class="quote">"a.k.a. Spirit Warrior,"</span> has repeatedly demanded
panel members recuse themselves, and denied the Law Society Tribunal has
jurisdiction over him.[224] At a 7-8 January 2019 hearing, Bogue
summoned officers of the Ottawa Police Service, presumably to arrest the
Tribunal panel.[225] The Law Society of Ontario's slow and apparently
ineffectual control of Bogue, an abusive OPCA litigation representative,
is troubling.</p>

Callender's family connection to vaccines and offshore business</a>
</h2>
<p>Todd Callender's family operated a company called Genesis Medical
Technologies, which developed needle-free vaccine syringes, and which
was the first US company with an approved business in Cuba. I found a
Czech translation of an English press release from 1999, which I
translated back to English below:
[<a href=https://www.protext.cz/zpravy/genesis-bezprecedentni-spoluprace-usa-a-kuby/854>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>protext.<wbr>cz/<wbr>zpravy/<wbr>genesis-<wbr>bezprecedentni-<wbr>spoluprace-<wbr>usa-<wbr>a-<wbr>kuby/<wbr>854</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis Medical Technologies, Inc. (<span
class="quote">"Genesis"</span>) has worked closely with authorities in
Cuba and the United States over the past year to complete the halfway
point of testing its needle-free syringe for commercial sale to the mass
immunization market. Genesis remains the only U.S. company to have a
successful approved business in Cuba. A portion of Genesis' field test
in Cuba was postponed in June due to communication and logistical
issues.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented collaboration between the United States and Cuba,
authorities in both countries worked hard to help Genesis overcome
bureaucratic hurdles and move testing forward. The delays raised
concerns about the vaccine's efficacy after long storage in
polypropylene containers. As a result, Dr. Manuel Diaz of the Cuban
Institute of Tropical Diseases agreed to burn plastic vials filled with
the vaccine in the presence of Dr. Lynn Whitlock of the United States
Interest Section in Havana. The event marked the first <span
class="quote">"end-user"</span> validation of American technology and
created a platform for the two governments to find common ground through
trade.</p>
<p>Todd Callender, general counsel for the Colorado-based company, said
that <span class="quote">"end-user verifications are probably the most
important tool the United States uses to improve trade relations with
former enemies. I witnessed the same process throughout Eastern Europe
in the early 1990s and saw the results of that process in the form of
more liberal export permits and trade. I am impressed by the progress
that Cuba and the United States have made in this regard."</span></p>
<p>Thanks to Cuba's cooperation in this <span
class="quote">"end-user"</span> inspection and the efforts of both
governments to improve trade relations, Genesis received a new export
authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce and was able to ship
replacements to Cuba in less than a month. The field test is currently
scheduled to begin in mid-August and is expected to be completed in
early September. Genesis expects to be attended by representatives from
the United States Interest Section, the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Bahamian Ministry
of Health. WHO is monitoring the field test with the goal of validating
the needle-free syringe and certifying it as an approved device for use
in its global immunization program. Successful completion of this
important test should allow the syringe to be commercially available by
the first quarter of 2000, a good start for treating diseases in the new
millennium.</p>

<p>The company was based in Colorado, but Callender was admitted to the
Colorado Bar Association in 1995.

the <span class="quote">"primary investment vehicle for the Rothschild

He served as a naval intelligence officer in 1953-1956. His bio says
that his <span class="quote">"involvement with venture capital started

He was the president of Dillon, Read &amp; Co in the 80s, during the
same period when Catherine Austin Fitts was first their vice president,
then senior vice president, and then managing director.</p>
<p>Todd Callender was a lawyer for AFLDS, and his organization
Vaxxchoice started out as a sister organization of AFLDS. References to
Todd Callender started to appear on Twitter in August 2021, when he
spoke at an event organized by AFLDS.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22todd+callender%22+until%3A2021-9-1&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=%<wbr>22todd+<wbr>callender%<wbr>22+<wbr>until%<wbr>3A2021-<wbr>9-<wbr>1&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
Soon after that, Callender filed a lawsuit against the DoD on behalf of
AFLDS.</p>
<p>Callender's website had a prominent advertisement for ivermectin
right at the front page, which said: <span class="quote">"IVERMECTIN has
also shown to prevent prion disease from people who have had the Covid
19 experimental shots."</span>

I believe the first person who started to say that the calamari clots
were made of amyloid protein was Ryan Cole, who was named as the Medical
Director of AFLDS in 2021, and who lost his medical license for
prescribing ivermectin while he worked as a telehealth doctor for AFLDS.

<p>In April 2020 Jerome Corsi launched a telehealth website called
SpeakWithAnMD.com, where he raked in millions of dollars by selling
prescriptions for ivermectin and the Zelenko protocol. A report on
Corsi's website said that at one point the website earned over 100,000
USD per day in consultation fees through customers referred by AFLDS
alone: <span class="quote">"America's Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) - a
leading purveyor of coronavirus misinformation - refers patients to
SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that SpeakWithAnMD.com provides phone
consultations with <span class="quote">'AFLDS-trained physicians'</span>
willing to prescribe hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and other unproven
treatments. According to recent reports, AFLDS referred over 255,000
individuals to SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16, 2021, and September
12, 2021 - approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for initial phone
consultations and many of whom had follow-up consultations for an
additional $60. One investigation also found that some individuals were
charged for consultations that never occurred. In total, individuals
appear to have paid more than $6.7 million for consultations during this
two-month period, generating $113,000 per day, on average, for
SpeakWithAnMD.com and AFLDS."</span>

<p>Corsi's site was initially partnered with an online pharmacy called
Bonsa Health, which appears to have been set up for the purpose of
selling the drugs prescribed by Corsi's site.

Later Corsi's site was partnered with a company operated by Alpesh Patel
and Manish Patel, who had previously been involved in major medical
insurance fraud. They filled about 340,000 prescriptions from Corsi's
site between November 2020 and September 2021, which amounted to an
estimated 8.5 million USD in drug costs.

<p>Jerome Corsi is the first person from whom I heard the phrase <span

designed to discredit me in Poland at a time when the Knesset was
predominantly Polish. That fraud was financed by Carl Lindner whose
website then boasted that he was the largest non-Jewish contributor to
Jewish causes in the U.S. I urge that you immediately engage the
documentation provided. My life experience proves the common source of
ongoing geopolitical duplicity, including the narrative-advancing role
played by Corsi.</p>
<p>To portray Corsi as a conspiracy theorist misses the point. He is
either an Israeli agent or a wellpaid asset of the Jewish state. Ask him
about me. Better yet, subpoena me, Munther Ghazal, Ron Burd, my attorney
since 1992, and Jeff Gates, a colleague since 2002. Let us provide
questions to ask Corsi. Note how, while I was in London, I outed him as
a Mossad operative, per the blue-tabbed material. He knows what he did -
and for whom.</p>

<p>Woolsey's pro-Israel, war profiteering profile is typical of those
with whom I interacted - and those operating one degree off those I
profiled while being stalked. That's why the career of U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Rey also merits a closer look.</p>
<p>Former vice-chairman of the $240 million U.S.-funded Polish-American
Enterprise Fund, he then became a principal in Intellibridge, chaired by
David Rothkopf, former managing director of Kissinger Associates. I
learned from hard experience that Kissinger's presence is a sure sign
that those I profiled are nearby. In advertising their security services
on the Intellibridge website, Rey (since deceased) and Rothkopf offer
the on-call assistance of authorities and advisers <span
class="quote">"available to you and your employees anywhere,
anytime."</span></p>
<p>Their Israel-centric <span class="quote">"on-call"</span> advisory
corps includes: Stephen Solarz, former chair of the House Subcommittee
on Asia and the Pacific and a signer of the Project for a New American
Century's 1998 letter to President Clinton urging regime change in Iraq;
Morton Abramowitz, former assistant secretary of state for intelligence
and research, 1985-89; John Deutch, former CIA Director (1995-1996) who
succeeded Woolsey in enabling Russia's loan-for-shares fraud; and Al
From, founding president of the Democratic Leadership Council
(DLC).[41]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former CIA director John Deutch was a member of the advisory
board of the Intelligence Summit, which was an intelligence conference
in DC organized by Adam Finnegan's mentor John Loftus. The conference
was funded by the Israeli gangster Michael Cherney, who organized a
similar conference in Israel called the Jerusalem Summit.

Russia's biggest aluminum company used to be Trans-World Metals, which
was cofounded by Cherney together with his brother and two other Jews.
The money to set up the company was provided by Marc Rich, who
coordinated the FIMACO money laundering scheme, where former KGB and
Communist Party assets were transfered to the US secret economy through
companies connected to the Jewish mafia, including Cherney's company
Newtel.

Cherney's protege Oleg Deripaska was at one point called the richest man
in Russia, and he was a close associate of Nathaniel Rothschild and one
of the primary Rothschild agents in Russia.</p>

<p>The operators of the Copiaport-E megaproject report that St Matthew

Operaciones Marítimas SpA since 2019. They also state that SMA is a
tribal insurance company originally incorporated and authorized under
the laws of the Modoc Nation. They add that, in 2023, the SMA relocated
to the Chiricahua Apache Nation (CAMB) and continues to operate under
insurance legislation adopted through the CAMB legislative process.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The benefits of incorporating the SMA under the laws of the Modoc
Nation are similar to those conferred by CAMB, so there would be no
reason for the aforementioned move. In fact, there are more companies
that remain registered under the Modoc Nation. Such is the case of Rf
Defense Technologies Ltd, registered by Todd Callender as its Executive
Director, with the address of the Modoc Tribal Complex: 22 N Eight

through offshore companies. Not counting the firms set up in Brazil and
Chile, between 1989 and 2007 alone they established at least 22 of these
companies: 16 in the British Virgin Islands and the rest in the Bahamas,
Panama, Niue and Samoa.

<p>Callender also discussed Copiaport-E in 2025 with Jerome Corsi.

Corsi said that Callender is the CEO of the Cotswold Group in the
Bahamas, which owns Copiaport-E. And Callender said: <span
class="quote">"Yes, that's exactly right. We own all said and done. It's
220,000 hectares - otherwise known as 850 square miles - of real estate.
The area - the estate is known as Hacienda Castilla. And it includes an
8 kilometer long peninsula that sticks out into the Pacific Ocean. It's
a geological anomaly because it's got a deep water lee side and it acts
as a natural breakwater to the prevailing winds and currents, such that
we would be able to accommodate multiple aircraft carriers or Chinamax
sized vessels without any dredging whatsoever, which makes this really a
gem of the Pacific."</span> Then he said: <span class="quote">"I've had
many conversations with people in the U.S. Navy who spent a lot of time
in that region for reasons I don't fully understand. Antarctica is a
huge national security interest for our DOD, and they're patrolling
those waters down there, looking for some place that might be usable for
them to refuel, resupply, things of that nature in South America. And so
we've had a lot of discussions about it with people in the Trump
administration, prior and to some extent now. And at the same time,
other nations recognize its value as well. So it's not an unknown
quantity. That property and that peninsula were actually early
identified by the Chinese, way back at the start of their Belt and Road
Initiative. As I understand it, from people in the World Bank, that our
peninsula was actually designated as their landing zone in South
America, and of course they've performed on that promise in many
respects."</span> Then Corsi said that China had a memorandum of
understanding to buy the port from Callender, but it was important to
not let the port fall in the hands of China. At time 11:03, Callender
said: <span class="quote">"China can get those cargo - these Chinamax
ships - cargo ships into Copiaport-E, but they can't get them into the
port in Peru. And they can't get them into any ports on the eastern
side. They can't get them through the Panama Canal. And if they can get
them into Copiaport-E, they can save 15 days sailing time and improve
the efficiency of getting their food from Argentina by 800%
minimum."</span> At time 20:30, Callender seems to have suggested that
he was a member of an indigenous tribe (or I don't know if he meant that
he represented the tribe even though he was not its member): <span
class="quote">"They had to go and have discussions and ensure that they
were happy with what was happening in their former territorial lands as
indigenous - and we've had discussions between our tribe and them. We're
all indigenous. We're all in agreement. This is good for everybody. That
was the last thing. That was the last part of our application to Chilean
regulators, and it came back positive."</span></p>
<p>The website of Callender's group looks ultra-shady, and it doesn't

<p>The website says: <span class="quote">"Disability, Critical Illness
and other morbidity risks were and remain our focus with world-wide
coverage with incidental qualified death benefits available."</span> It
seems like a weird description for a company that owns the largest
private estate in Chile which supposedly has great geostrategic
importance. At first I thought the text might have just been random
mumbo jumbo generated by AI, but then I noticed that similar text is
included in Callender's bio for his PLLC Disabled Rights Advocates:

and life insurance industry for more than 20 years and focuses on the
international convergence of biomedical, morbidity and mortality risks

<p>In 2024 Callender sent an email to the Substack author Robert Yoho
that said: <span class="quote">"[I live in the] Bahamas. I was the first
and only American allowed to go into and do business with Cuba in the
1990s (1996-2000). Cuba remains an enemy nation, and in those days, the
restrictions were absolutely complete - no commerce, no travel, no
money, etc. I learned a great deal about the vaccine business while
there because I was overseeing clinical field trials of my family's
needle-free injector (for mass vaccinations) - it's why I sued the DOD.
We had tested mRNA technology for 20 years, and the test animals died in
every case. I tried to warn anyone and everyone in gov't that the covid
shots were poison, and no one wanted to hear me - because they planned
to poison everyone. Such was my launch into the Truther
Movement."</span>
[<a href=https://robertyoho.substack.com/p/334-todd-callenders-version-of-the>https://<wbr>robertyoho.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>334-<wbr>todd-<wbr>callenders-<wbr>version-<wbr>of-<wbr>the</a>]</p>
<p>I didn't know that Callender personally was overseeing clinical
trials for the injector technology, or that he personally was the only
American who was allowed to do business in Cuba. But it's likely a lie
that his experience with his family company led him to turn against
vaccines, and it's nearly certainly a lie that the test animals given
mRNA vaccines died in every case.</p>
<p>At time 3:17 in an interview with the author, Callender said: <span
class="quote">"Yeah, so my journey - as it relates to the vaccine
business, because I came from that business, was my family owned a
needle-free mass vaccination injector - I spent three years in Cuba, an
enemy nation, doing clinical trials. And because it was an enemy nation,
the WHO wasn't there, Pfizer wasn't there. In fact, I was the only
American there for 3 years. So I was very well placed in the Cuban
government. There were moves from the U.S. Congress to try and liberate
some commerce to go with them. And I was the guy that led the way. My
point in saying that is that I invited and brought both Pfizer and the
WHO and others into Cuba. So I actually know these people. 20 years goes
by. My sister and mom had been running the company for those 20 years.
But I was able to watch the clinical trials that had happened with what
they call collaborations with various experimental shots, including
mRNA. And for the 20 years that we were watching these MRNA shots get
tested, all the test animals died."</span>

<p>At time 38:40, the host said: <span class="quote">"So your family has
lived in the Bahamas. That's your history with the Bahamas,
right?"</span> Then Callender said: <span class="quote">"No, no, no, not
at all. I landed here because the only way for me to get medical
supplies into Cuba - again, an enemy nation, I was the only American
there for three years - was to fly my own airplane in and bring the
cargo with me. Commuting from Colorado in a little twin engine airplane
with medical supplies was not very realistic. So I kept an apartment
here and I would fly to and from Cuba because my license from the US
government would not allow me to reside in Cuba. So I spent half time
there, half time here. And at the end of the field trial, I met my
Bahamian wife and I stayed."</span></p>
<p>At time 50:36 Callender said: <span class="quote">"I used to be an
executive director of a bank called Ansbacher that Qatar National Bank
bought."</span></p>
<p>Ansbacher and related entities are included in the Paradise Papers,

Peter J. Nygård is a Canadian fashion mogul, who moved to the Bahamas in
the 80s, where he built a huge estate where he hosted guests like George
H. W. Bush and Michael Jackson. In 2020 the headquarters of his company
were raided by the FBI as part of a sex trafficking investigation. In
2024 he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for 4 counts of sexual
assault in Canada (even though his youngest victim was 16 years old
which is not underage in Canada).

<p>John Furze was the managing director of the Cayman branch of the
Ansbacher bank, which was part of the Henry Ansbacher banking group in
London, which was owned by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons.</p>
<p>An article from 1997 when Furze died said:
[<a href=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/cayman-islanders-mourn-for-a-model-citizen-1.93367>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>irishtimes.<wbr>com/<wbr>culture/<wbr>cayman-<wbr>islanders-<wbr>mourn-<wbr>for-<wbr>a-<wbr>model-<wbr>citizen-<wbr>1.<wbr>93367</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1988, Guinness Mahon Cayman Trust, which by then employed 35
people, was bought by Henry Ansbacher Holdings Ltd. The bank's name was
changed to Ansbacher Ltd.</p>
<p>According to evidence heard by the tribunal in London, before the
sale the bank had been sold by Guinness Mahon to the people who had
basically established it: Mr Furze, Mr Collins and Mr Traynor.</p>
<p>A share was also held by Mr Hugh Hart, a Jamaican national who is an
ex-minister of tourism and is chairman of Ansbacher Cayman. The four men
sold a 75 per cent shareholding for around £6 million to Ansbacher. They
retained 25 per cent for themselves before also selling that to
Ansbacher. The bulk of the bank's business was with what the new parent
company referred to as <span class="quote">"the Irish
accounts"</span>.</p>
<p>In 1989, Ansbacher bought Cayman International Trust Company and Mr
Furze continued as joint managing director of the joint entity. But
change was on its way. In its London hearings, the tribunal was told
that Ansbacher Holdings was concerned about the <span
class="quote">"Irish accounts"</span> the Cayman bank was holding.
(These are what we now know as the Ansbacher Deposits.)</p>
<p>An investigation was launched. An executive subsequently described
the difficulties as a clash of cultures, saying Ansbacher was a <span
class="quote">"bureaucratic"</span> bank, whereas the Cayman operation
was an <span class="quote">"entrepreneurial"</span> bank. Ansbacher
decided to impose a single bureaucratic culture throughout its
holdings.</p>
<p>It was around this time that Mr Furze is known to have moved Irish
accounts to a fund management company called Hamilton Ross which he
controlled.</p>
<p>This company took over accounts, including Mr Haughey's, from
Ansbacher, and moved monies from Ansbacher to open its own accounts in
the Irish Intercontinental Bank in Dublin. Presumably, the move allowed
Mr Furze the freedom to continue working with his Irish clients in the
personal, secretive and almost informal way he had established during
the Guinness &amp; Mahon period.</p>
<p>It was money from the Ansbacher and later the Hamilton Ross accounts
which supplied the money which in turn paid Mr Haughey's living expenses
of around £300,000 per year. Mr Furze managed the accounts; it is not
clear who will or has already taken them over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1988/89, Mr Furze was district governor for Rotary International
District 404, a position which involved him having to visit every club
on all the 13 Caribbean islands which make up the district. All this
charitable work was done in time snatched from his busy work
schedule.</p>
<p>Mr Furze was also <span class="quote">"an active and outstanding
Freemason"</span> who joined the Cayman Lodge No 8153 in June 1982, and
served as master of the lodge in 1990, according to Mr Balls. Another
colleague says Mr Furze would sometimes spend three to four evenings a
week with the local lodge.</p>
<p>Pressed as to what he would be doing, the source says he would at
times practise for the rituals involved in initiating new members or
bringing members to higher levels. Mr Furze was good at remembering the
words and movements and timings involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Furze died in 1997, Ansbacher was ran by Barry Benjamin.

<p>Todd Callender's sister said: <span class="quote">"My father was a

<p><span class="quote">"Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd"</span> was originally
known as Guiness Mahon Cayman Trust, which was established by in 1970 by
Des Traynor, who later became a co-managing director of the Guiness
Mahon bank. Guiness Mahon's head was James Edward Alexander Rundell
Guinness, whose daughter Sabrina dated King Charles and Mick Jagger.
Epstein called her an <span class="quote">"old buddy"</span>:

<blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein described Anglo-Irish banking heiress Sabrina
Guinness as one of his <span class="quote">"old buddies"</span> ahead of
a dinner in London in January 2017.</p>
<p>Guinness comes from the banking line of the family and her father was
James Edward Alexander Rundell Guinness, former chairman of Guinness
Mahon Holdings - the merchant bank that compromised hundreds of Irish
elites with offshore Ansbacher accounts.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Epstein, considering the guestlist, replied, "Fiona golfar. sabrina
guiness. Jessica rothschild. andre belagz, stan bucky bucktahl. what a
collection all old buddies".</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Guinness Mahon's Irish operation facilitated illegal offshore Cayman
Islands bank accounts for the state's political and social hierarchy.
<span class="quote">"The world's sleaziest bank,"</span> the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, which the CIA used to transfer funds
during the Iran-Contra affair and for other covert operations, had
offices registered in the Guinness Mahon Building in Grand Cayman.</p>
<p>Under the scheme clients would deposit funds into a bank in the west
Caribbean territory, allowing them to avoid tax and access the funds in
Ireland through Guinness Mahon. The scheme left participants - Irish
elites - deeply exposed.</p>
