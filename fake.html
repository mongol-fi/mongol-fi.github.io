Matt was so angry with our PubPeer comments that he started

<p>The website of Cure Guardian says: <span class="quote">"Cure Guardian
was founded by Matthew Nachtrab and the shareholders of Cassava Sciences
who witnessed an unprecedented attack by short sellers to stop their FDA
approved clinical trials for their drug Simufilam. The short sellers
were successful in this campaign by leveraging an attorney (Jordan
Thomas) to walk them into the SEC and DOJ and kickstart investigations.
These outsiders should not be able to weaponize the government and
institution investigative divisions against researchers and
companies."</span>
[<a href=https://cureguardian.org/>https://cureguardian.org/</a>]
ScienceGuardians also posted a long tweet about Cassava.
[<a href=https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1937339434447278260>https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1937339434447278260</a>]</p>
<p>In October 2024 Nachtrab showed that he held about 2.7 million shares
of Cassava. Their value was about 75 million USD, which made up about
36% of the total value of his portfolio.
[<a href=https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1848772514610106719>https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1848772514610106719</a>]
Cassava had no products on the market, but they were developing an
Alzheimer's drug called Simufilam. In November 2024 Cassava announced
that they had stopped developing Simufilam because its phase 3 trial had
failed, so as a result their stock price crashed from about 30 USD to 3
USD, and it has remained around the range of 2 to 3 USD since then. In
April 2025 Matt Nachtrab tweeted: <span class="quote">"I liquidated all
of my $sava. I have lost all confidence in the team."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1910351007730618455>https://x.com/MattNachtrab/status/1910351007730618455</a>]
So he likely lost more than 50 million USD.</p>
<p>The value of Cassava's stock increased about 10-fold in early 2021
after they reported promising results in their Simufilam trials. Cassava
had a market capitalization of about 2 billion USD, even though they had
no product on the market, zero revenue, and only a few employees.
Cassava was a high-volatility stock that was hyped up by meme stock
traders on Reddit.
[<a href=https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21>https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21</a>]</p>
<p>In August 2021 a law firm that represents SEC whistleblowers
submitted a citizen petition to the FDA, where they requested the FDA to
halt the Simufilam trials because of misconduct.
[<a href=https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0001>https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0001</a>]
Cassava's stock price dropped by about 50% after the petition, and two
days after the petition was submitted, the law firm disclosed that their
clients held a short position in Cassava's stock.
[<a href=https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21>https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cassava-sciences-can-recover-despite-harsh-allegations-2021-09-21</a>]
After the petition, Elizabeth Bik and other people at PubPeer began to
look into Cassava, and the law firm later submitted a supplement to the
petition which incorporated discoveries by Bik.
[<a href=https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0023>https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0930-0023</a>]</p>
<p>In November 2021 a group of four authors submitted another report
about Cassava to the FDA.
[<a href=https://www.cassavafraud.com>https://www.cassavafraud.com</a>]
A Powerpoint presentation which accompanied the report said: <span
class="quote">"The authors of this presentation and the associated
letter to FDA hold stock and options positions that may benefit from a
decline in Cassava Sciences' stock price."</span>
[<a href=https://www.cassavafraud.com/docs/SAVAReport_Deck_2021_11_03.pdf>https://www.cassavafraud.com/docs/SAVAReport_Deck_2021_11_03.pdf</a>]
Cassava used the term <span class="quote">"perpetrators"</span> to refer
to the authors of the report.
[<a href=https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-files-lawsuit-against-perpetrators-short-and>https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-files-lawsuit-against-perpetrators-short-and</a>]</p>
<p>In November 2021 a hedge fund called Quintessential Capital
Management published a report about Cassava, where QCM wrote that their
<span class="quote">"main activity consists in identifying,
investigating and exposing fraud and criminal conduct in public
companies around the world"</span>, and they wrote that they had
previously conducted campaigns which led to the collapse of several
public companies.
[<a href=https://assets.empirefinancialresearch.com/uploads/2021/11/Cassava-Report-FINAL-3-R-1.pdf>https://assets.empirefinancialresearch.com/uploads/2021/11/Cassava-Report-FINAL-3-R-1.pdf</a>]
The report included a disclosure that <span class="quote">"QCM is SHORT
the stock of Cassava Sciences (SAVA)"</span>. QCM wrote: <span
class="quote">"We are a commercial enterprise, and we work for profit.
However, we firmly believe in the moral character of our work, which has
the effect of removing dishonest companies from the markets."</span> I
don't know if QCM was also behind the original citizen petition, or if
they decided to target Cassava because of the information that was
uncovered after the petition was released.</p>
<p>The report by QCM said: <span class="quote">"A number of forensic
experts including, Dr. Elizabeth Bik and consultants hired by QCM, have
systematically reviewed the documents and confirmed the allegations,
pointing out that Cassava and Dr. Wang could have easily disputed the
claims simply releasing the originals of the images in question (for the
record: they haven't)."</span> But it's not clear if QCM compensated Bik
for her research.</p>
<p>In December 2021 Leonid Schneider wrote: <span class="quote">"This is
probably the world premiere of data integrity sleuths seeking to earn
money with manipulating the stock market by exposing research fraud. At
least two sets of them are now short-trading Cassava stocks, betting on
the stock value to drop as they reveal lies and fabrications this
company submitted in scientific journals and FDA."</span>
[<a href=https://forbetterscience.com/2021/12/15/cassava-fraud-and-alzheimers-capitalism/>https://forbetterscience.com/2021/12/15/cassava-fraud-and-alzheimers-capitalism/</a>]</p>
<p>So it explains why Matt Nachtrab would claim that the purpose of
people at PubPeer is to game the stock market, even though it seems to
rather reflect his personal experience with Cassava, and there are
likely not too many other instances where the stock price of a company
was considerably influenced by comments at PubPeer.</p>

<p>Nicolas Hulscher said that AIN's declaration <span

<p>The story was also promoted by Peter McCullough, Andrew Bridgen,

<p>Sansone wrote that the Alliance of Indigenous Nations International
Tribunal issued the order <span class="quote">"after reviewing hundreds
of pages of evidence from my current case, including scientific papers
and legal briefs filed in the Florida court system, as well other
scientific papers"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/exclusive-breaking-news-alliance>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/exclusive-breaking-news-alliance</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration by AIN looks similar to the complaint in Sansone's
court case in Florida, because it features expert opinions by Francis
Boyle, Ana Mihalcea, Andrew Zywiec, Paul Alexander, and Rima Laibow, who
all provided testimony to Sansone's case. 3 out of 11 pages of the
declaration were dedicated to the expert opinion of Ana Mihalcea, who
said that vaccines contain quantum dots, nanorobots, microrobots, and
hydrogel. In 2023 Ana Mihalcea gave an address to AIN on the threat of
nanotechnology.
[<a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-address-to-the-alliance-of-indigenous>https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/my-address-to-the-alliance-of-indigenous</a>]</p>
<p>Andrew Zywiec was called a <span class="quote">"tribal
practicioner"</span> in the declaration. He claims he is <span
class="quote">"literally a tribal physician with Crow Nation"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/AndrewZywiecMD/status/1976798052456550520>https://x.com/AndrewZywiecMD/status/1976798052456550520</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration had no author listed, but I suspect one of its
authors was Joe Sansone. The declaration was signed by <span
class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span> and by two other people whose
names were not legible:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-2.webp width=500>

<p>You can tell the declaration is the real deal, because it features
this seal by <span class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span>:</p>

<p>A Leaping Ram is a sovereign citizen guru called Glenn Bogue, who is
also known as Spirit Warrior. He appears to have first started to claim
he was a <span class="quote">"non-status Métis"</span> around the year
2018 (which means that he doesn't have formal Indian status under the
Indian Act).

He is a member of the Kinakwii Private Sovereign Nation, which is a fake
online Indian tribe that was founded in 2004 and that charges 300 CAD
per year for membership:

<p>With regard to the claim by Glenn Bogue to be <span

<p>The AIN Tribunal was allegedly created by those who presented

<p>Over the past 6 years, the ASMIN Grand Chief Wabiska (GC) has
undergone recovery from a traumatic brain Injury and major brain

<hr />
<p>In 2024 Alfred Lambremont Webre hosted a video panel that featured
Glenn Bogue and John Cipolla from the Alliance of Indigenous Nations,
and two people from a fake Indian nation called Peoples of the Salmon:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQbfHseV2o>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQbfHseV2o</a>]</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>A paper about the sovereign citizen movement in Canada said: <span
class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Peoples of the Salmon'</span> is
a recent example: a <span class="quote">'Sovereign Movement'</span>
founded in 2020 to take <span class="quote">'ownership of
property,'</span> and that purports to incorporate all persons in
British Columbia within <span class="quote">'new self-governing
communities.'</span>[177] The Peoples of the Salmon offers all Canadians
memberships, <span class="quote">'Exemption Pass'</span> IDs, and <span
class="quote">'World Passport[s]'</span> for various amounts.[178]
Members are called <span class="quote">'Wolverines,'</span> who are
promised $7.5 million <span class="quote">'lifetime dowry'</span>
imaginary Strawman bank accounts.[179] <span
class="quote">'Wolverine'</span> status also requires a <span
class="quote">'Walking Off the Ship'</span> Ceremony to <span
class="quote">'leave the Ship of Commerce/Maritime/Admiralty Law - which
is a fiction created by the British Crown and the
Merchants.'</span>[180]"</span>
[<a href=https://freemandelusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/New-Hosts-for-an-Old-Disease-History-of-the-Organized-Pseudolegal-Commercial-Argument-Phenomenon-in-Canada-Part-III.pdf>https://freemandelusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/New-Hosts-for-an-Old-Disease-History-of-the-Organized-Pseudolegal-Commercial-Argument-Phenomenon-in-Canada-Part-III.pdf</a>]
Reference 179 was a page on the website of Peoples of the Salmon, which
said: <span class="quote">"Each and every one of us has a lifetime dowry
equivalent to $7.5 million CAD, based on our corporate Birth
Certificates, of which the current Rothschild banking system has been
using to borrow and lend against. This will be returned to the
people."</span>
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814221250/https://peoplesofthesalmon.org/building-community/25-year-plan/>https://web.archive.org/web/20220814221250/https://peoplesofthesalmon.org/building-community/25-year-plan/</a>]
(So apparently the <span class="quote">"lifetime dowry"</span> was not
specifically promised to people who joined Peoples of the Salmon, but it
referred to the usual sovereign citizen trope of a secret strawman bank
account attached to a person at birth.)</p>
<p>At time 17:21 in the video panel, Webre said: <span
class="quote">"John is the leader and coordinator of the Alliance of
Indigenous Nations that your humble servant is part of, along with
others."</span> So apparently Webre is a member of AIN.</p>
<p>At time 26:49 Webre talked about his book titled <span
class="quote">"In The Future, Will The United States Of America Break Up
Into Many Regions?"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Spirit
Warrior - Glenn Bogue, the Attorney General of the Alliance of
Indigenous Nations - has contributed a part - uh, extended part - to the
book."</span></p>
<p>At time 30:49, A Leaping Ram said: <span class="quote">"Those who
have studied the history of our solar system would quickly, uh, consede
the fact that the Earth used to be outside of Mars - between Mars and
Jupiter - because of something called Bode's mathematical law."</span>
And he said that at the time the earth shone like a blue jewel to
spaceships going by from other planets and other solar systems. He said
the name for the earth in ancient languages was Gop. And he said that
the earth moved to its current location around 400,000 BC, because one
of the moons of Planet X crashed into the earth. He said that before it
the east coast of Canada and the west coast of Europe used to be part of
a single continent called Pangea, which was populated by the Solutrean
people. (Which I presume is meant to explain why there would be white
indigenous people like himself on the east coast of Canada.)</p>
<p>At time 39:18, A Leaping Ram said: <span class="quote">"This is the
ancient indigenous knowledge that - number one, a female scientist
changed the ovum of an ape into human beings by putting in a sperm from
their Planet X there, and then one of their gods, Enki, the son of man,
had sex with the two daughters of Eve, creating <em>Homo sapiens</em>.
Now, I will hold fast to that, until somebody can come up to me and
disprove the National Geographic DNA study, or the ancient
texts."</span> At time 50:11, he said that the event when the female
scientist from Planet X created humans took place 200,000 years ago, and
that she specifically inserted sperm from Planet X into the egg of a
bonobo. (But then were the Solutreans who lived on Pangea 400,000 years
ago not humans? Or were they part of another earlier creation?)</p>
<p>At time 1:31:07 Webre addressed the panelists and said: <span
class="quote">"What I'd like to do is advise all of the participants,
who are leaders of Turtle Island indigenous nations - that on behalf of
the tribunal, we'll be inviting each of the four of you - and I'm
putting this - to be attendees at The First International Earth
Conference on Extraterrestrial Genocide, and Successful and Mutually
Advantageous Planetary Rescue, Positive Alliance, and Integration with
Homo Martis Terris. They are the human Martian civilization. And it's
all set out there. We're in the process of arranging an international
conference, uh, to ally the positive human civilization with the
positive Martian civilization. We have the information that there are
about 1 million, uh, Homo Martis Terris, or human Martian civilization
members. They're our genetic cousins. They're a bit more advanced than
earthling humans, and a bit more ethical, living under the surface of
Mars. And that's a conference, and I'll be sending each of you
invitations."</span></p>
<p>Webre's Martian conference was part of his series of tribunals called
the <span class="quote">"Natural and Common Law Tribunal for Public
Health &amp; Justice"</span>. Webre's source that there are about one
million members of the race Homo Martis Terris was Andrew Basiago, who
is supposed to have met one of the Martians when he traveled back in
time to 1970:

<p>Alfred Lambremont Webre says that the book he wrote with A Leaping
Ram is based on information leaked from a DARPA-CIA time travel program:
[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Future-United-States-America-Regions-ebook/dp/B0C87CRKTL>https://www.amazon.com/Future-United-States-America-Regions-ebook/dp/B0C87CRKTL</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>Alfred Lambremont Webre coined the term <span
class="quote">"exopolitics"</span>, by which he means <span
class="quote">"the science of relations among intelligent civilizations
in the multiverse"</span>. He claims that he worked as a futurist at the
Stanford Research Institute, and that he was the director of the <span
class="quote">"1977 Jimmy Carter White House Extraterrestrial
Communication Study"</span> at the SRI, but I didn't find evidence that
he actually worked at the SRI, and the 1977 study appears to be his
invention, because almost all references to the study I found came from
Webre. Webre also claims that extraterrestrials coordinated a meeting
between himself and Jimmy Carter on a spaceship in 1977.

<p>Webre was on the board of advisors of the New Energy Movement, which
is a free energy organization founded by the New Age guy Brian O'Leary.

The European offshoot of New Energy Movement is run by the Dutch people
who organized the Secret Space Program conference, and who now run
Solari Europa and who do the video and audio production for Catherine
Austin Fitts.

<p>The World Bank whistleblower Karen Hudes used to claim that the
global banking system was covertly controlled by a cone-headed race of
hominins called the <em>Homo capensis</em>, but she later renounced the
theory, and she said it was disinformation that was fed to her by Edward
Spencer and Alfred Lambremont Webre.

The <em>Homo capensis</em> theory is reminiscent of Webre's theory that
there is a race of Martian humans called Homo Martis Terris.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Indigenous Nations says that their goal is to build a
<span class="quote">"New Earth, a better and Spiritually Enlightened

It reminded me of Sacha Stone's various ventures, like the New Earth
Project, New Earth Haven, New Earth Trust, New Earth Treaty, New Earth

New Earth Horizon, and so on.

Alfred Lambremont Webre was a judge at Sacha Stone's international court
larping operation called the International Tribunal for Natural Justice.
During an ITNJ hearing in April 2020 where Webre played the role of a
judge, he declared that SARS-CoV-2 was not a virus but an exosome, which
meant that all lockdown orders were null and void under both national
and common law.

<p>Sacha Stone gave an address at the AIN summit in 2024.

He also did a 2-hour interview with AIN, where he said he was working on
setting up the World Hereditary Council, which would hold tribunals
where indigenous people would testify on issues like the crimes of the
Vatican, and he said that he wanted to collaborate with AIN in
conducting the tribunals.

time 1:58:07] At time 59:19 Sacha Stone said <span class="quote">"But
the problem of course is the so-called mRNA interventionism right now,
and the fact that human biology is so saturated with graphene oxide, and
hydrogels, and all sorts of wicked chemistry. And I say wicked
chemistry, because by my understanding and my reckoning, it is precisely
the source code of the devil - equates to the synthetic
molecule."</span> At time 1:02:09 a lady in the video said: <span
class="quote">"I can only say, I am just so moved by your words, all of
them. They are so pure and from the heart."</span> And she said: <span
class="quote">"You're like the Christ himself, walking around the earth.
That's how I see. And certainly I feel that essence and power, having
met him myself when I was two."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>During another interview with Alfred Lambremont Webre in 2024, A
Leaping Ram said: <span class="quote">"I suspect that Enki - I know the
man who took Enki's trust fund from Vancouver to Beijing in 2000, just
before the COVID patents happened according to Dr. David Martin - and we
got halfway over the Pacific Ocean, he opened up this book - he's a
courier, right, he's a professional courier - he has, goes to the men's
bathroom, you know, whatever, has a quick peek - it's in the trillions
as the wealth left from San Francisco into Vancouver - and then left
over to Beijing. And now Beijing is set up to destroy - to destroy North
America. Which is the original home of the Black Empire in the Colorado
Grand Canyon. There are temples, pyramids to Isis and Osiris, in the
Grand Canyon. We're not allowed to go there. There have been spaceships
- single-pilot spaceships - from the war in Orion - are there in caves,
in the Grand Canyon. The black-headed people came out of the Grand
Canyon Empire, and appeared in Ireland, which is the outcrop of
Atlantis. Gaelic is ancient, um, Sanskrit language, that became ancient
Swedish. And from Sweden over to Tibet. That's why Swedish names are on
Tibet temples."</span>

<p>At time 35:32, A Leaping Ram now also said that when the female
scientist came from Planet X to create humans, she carved the face on
Mars on her way to the earth: <span class="quote">"Her name was Ninmah.
And Ninmah came to the Earth. She was the greatest biologist they had.
The men couldn't figure out how to get this ape thing to become a miner,
you know. You know, a mineral miner in Ethiopia. So they brought Ninmah
from Planet X, and en route she carved the face on Mars, as an ancient
god. That's a complicated story. One of their kings died there, and, so,
uh. She does the monument, comes to Ethiopia, creates <em>Homo
sapiens</em>."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:06:42, A Leaping Ram said that the ancient Egyptian texts
state that on the 14th day and 28th day of her moon cycle, the woman
produces a very special monoatomic atom called the Ormus molecule. He
said that creation of the molecule requires two substances, which are
seawater fish and wine, because seawater fish contains precious metals
with a high atomic spin, and because the grapevine was brought to the
earth from Planet X for the purpose of extracting precious metals from
the soil. And he said that <span class="quote">"in a science journal
magazine in 2005, they proved that the high-spin Ormus molecule does
three things: it repairs DNA damage, it raises the intelligence of
stupid there - like Fred Flintstone, you know what I'm talking about -
and, and, it opens the stargate."</span> And he said: <span
class="quote">"So I happened to contact a guy in New York, who was doing
a trampoline display at a health show. He was in, uh, uh, Arizona,
making these trampolines. And I knew that Einstein said, if you could
move the body against gravity, and let it come down safely, you would
put the cells into what's called a dry pack. You would put the female
clitoris which is the cosmic trigger of the skene glands - S-K-E-N-E -
of the female that produces massive amounts of ejaculate. Only 10% of
women can ejaculate. Because they haven't been taught. There's not many
courses running around on female ejaculate."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>AIN claims that they were <span class="quote">"officially
recognized"</span> by CIRNAC (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern
Affairs Canada). AIN's website says: <span class="quote">"In a letter
from
<a href=https://allianceofindigenousnations.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AIN-CIRNAC-Recognition-w-Address-redacted.pdf>CIRNAC</a>
dated Dec. 13, 2024, the U.N. member Nation CANADA officially recognized
the Alliance of Indigenous Nations, along with its Treaty and its
International Tribunal presided over by Judges from all over the world.
CANADA also stated that the relationship between CANADA and the A.I.N.
is Nation to Nation."</span>
[<a href=https://allianceofindigenousnations.org>https://allianceofindigenousnations.org</a>]</p>
<p>The so-called <span class="quote">"official recognition"</span>
referred to an email by the Canadian Minister of Crown-Indigenous
Relations Gary Anandasangaree, where he happened to refer to AIN as a
<span class="quote">"nation"</span>. But I don't think it counts as any
kind of a formal recognition of AIN as a real indigenous organization
(and AIN isn't even supposed to be a nation but an alliance of nations):

<p>Anandasangaree has been criticized for doling out money to fake
Indians. He is an Indian from the country of India, but I guess that's
Indian enough. I didn't find a photo of Eagle Eyes anywhere, but the

In 2020 Rima Laibow was one of the judges in Webre's 5G tribunal, where
the tribunal ordered a ban on 5G, all vaccines, lockdown measures, and
aspartame. The tribunal also sentenced Elon Musk to 25 years in prison,

to a life in prison.

<p>I now identified the second person whose signature was included in
AIN's vaccine declaration. He is Lord Frederick Stewart, who is an
ambassador to a Papuan conman called King David:

<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-20.webp width=530>
</div>
<p>King David established a ponzi scheme called U-Vistract in the 1990s,
where he promised his investors a 100% interest rate per month. After
his scheme collapsed, he fled the authorities to his home island of
Bougainville, and he declared himself to be the king of a new nation he
established in his hometown.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Musingku>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Musingku</a>]
His crown contains 5 stars of David:</p>

<p>I didn't find any information about the ambassador Lord Frederick
Stewart, but he might just be some random guy who is the Canadian
ambassador to King David's country or something.</p>

<p>One of the nations that signed the AIN treaty was the <span
class="quote">"Taina Ke"</span> nation, whose representative was Alfred
Lambremont Webre:

<p>When I googled for a combination of the phrases <span
class="quote">"Taina Ke"</span> and <span class="quote">"Webre"</span>
in double quotes, there were only 3 results, which were a PDF for the
AIN treaty, and 2 posts from Webre's blog (where in both posts the
phrase <span class="quote">"Taina Ke"</span> appeared in a link to a
video Webre did with AIN). <span class="quote">"Taina-Ke"</span> is a
common term which means the land of the Taino, and the flag shown next
to Webre's signature is the common flag of the Taino people. Webre
claims he has a small amount of Native American DNA, which he says might
have come from the Taino because his mother was a Cuban.
[<a href=https://dokumen.pub/my-journey-landing-heaven-on-earth-1.html>https://dokumen.pub/my-journey-landing-heaven-on-earth-1.html</a>]
But I doubt any Taino people actually appointed Webre as their

<p>Donald Netolitzky has written a series papers about the sovereign

subject to a separate legal system in equity administered by an
aboriginal Métis decision-maker.</li>
<li>The 1613 <em>Two Row Wampum Treaty</em> has supraconstitutional
status and permits radical revision of Aboriginal status and
rights.</li>
<li>The <span class="quote">"Aboriginal Law of Ma'at"</span> and Métis
matrilineal authority from Egypt (Ma'at is an ancient Egyptian goddess)
has supraconstitutional status.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample passage illustrates the highly unusual and unorthodox
terminology and concepts in Bogue's arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the Metis Clan Grandmothers trace their land ownership via
the female mitochondria trail back through Egypt to Sumer, she has the
historic right to have jurisdiction over her children.</p>
<p>The Law of Ma'at is the earliest known version of Natural Justice or
the Law of Equity. The Sovereign Non-Status Aboriginals and Metis still
have a right to that ancient law via S. 35, since the SCC held in
<em>Delgamuukw</em> that S. 35 enshrines their existing rights, but does
not define them. One of those rights is to trace back to Natural Justice
and the Maxims of Equity that existed prior to the 1881 <span
class="quote">'merger'</span> of Law and Equity.[220]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bogue sought leave to appeal two Ontario Court of Appeal decisions,
costs of $500,000.00, and argued that five additional actions conducted
by Bogue also be joined and heard together with the AC 37380 application
since <span class="quote">"all have Sovereign Jurisdiction of the Metis
Nation as their main issue."</span>[221]</p>
<p>The Law Society Tribunal has concluded Bogue lacks capacity to meet
his obligations as a lawyer due to mental illness.[222] He had been
ordered to undergo psychiatric examination.[223] Bogue, <span
class="quote">"a.k.a. Spirit Warrior,"</span> has repeatedly demanded
panel members recuse themselves, and denied the Law Society Tribunal has
jurisdiction over him.[224] At a 7-8 January 2019 hearing, Bogue
summoned officers of the Ottawa Police Service, presumably to arrest the
Tribunal panel.[225] The Law Society of Ontario's slow and apparently
ineffectual control of Bogue, an abusive OPCA litigation representative,
is troubling.</p>

<p>Kevin Annett's Republic of Kanata is one of the fake nations which
has signed the AIN treaty. Annett used to run his own fake international
tribunal called ITCSS, similar to Sacha Stone's ITNJ and Webre's
tribunal. Donald Neotlitzky wrote:

<p>Annett subsequently expanded into pseudolaw. That initially, in 2012,
took the form of a fake common law court: the International Tribunal
into Crimes of Church and State (ITCCS).[102] Between 2012-2013, the
ITCCS announced it had dissolved Canada, and convicted and ordered the
arrest of numerous politicians and religious figures for genocide.[103]
Annett also authored several pseudolaw texts,[104] and, on 15 January
2015, proclaimed the foundation of an alternative/replacement <span
