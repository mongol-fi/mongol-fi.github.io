seminars attended by Fenton and McLachlan</a>
</h2>
<p>Fenton posted a tweet where he wrote: <span class="quote">"Between
2016 and 2022, I attended many research seminars in the UK on using AI
and Machine Learning to <span class="quote">'combat
misinformation'</span>. The example of Hunter Biden's laptop was
invariably used as a key <span class="quote">'learning'</span> example
so algorithms classified it as <span
class="quote">'misinformation'</span>, <span class="quote">'Russian
propaganda'</span>, <span class="quote">'Trump lies'</span>. Moreover,
anybody pushing that story was classified as a <span
class="quote">'spreader of misinformation'</span>, <span
class="quote">'conspiracy theorist'</span> etc. In fact, most of the
common <span class="quote">'training'</span> examples that were used -
many of which were based on things Trump supposedly said, as well as
about Covid - turned out to be true. So an enormous amount of research
was (and is still) spent on developing <span
class="quote">'clever'</span> algorithms which simply censor the truth
online."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/profnfenton/status/1829137988355281114>https://x.com/profnfenton/status/1829137988355281114</a>]
The seminars Fenton described sound like they might have been organized
by some organization connected to intelligence or mainstream media. Did
he also attend seminars on how to produce disinformation in order to
combat inconvenient information?</p>
<p>In an article where the Canadian company Calian described their
disinformation services, they wrote: <span class="quote">"We have
delivered disinformation components for military exercises, for domestic
major event security and for nuclear power generation exercises ranging
from coordinated campaigns across all media channels to limited
disinformation activities on key issues."</span> Calian wrote that their
training on information operations focuses on understanding how
adversaries use disinformation, which sounds similar to the content of
the seminars Fenton attended: <span class="quote">"Training on
information operations should focus on understanding how adversaries use
disinformation, who they are targeting, with what messaging and what
effect they are trying to achieve. As mentioned earlier, disinformation
is a deliberate process. Training for disinformation can help us unravel
the intention, target and likely outcomes the authors and spreaders of
disinformation are seeking to achieve."</span>
[<a href=https://www.calian.com/resources/blogs/disinformation-in-digital-spaces-a-key-weapon-in-war-and-competition-below-the-threshold-of-armed-conflict/>https://www.calian.com/resources/blogs/disinformation-in-digital-spaces-a-key-weapon-in-war-and-competition-below-the-threshold-of-armed-conflict/</a>]</p>
<p>Fenton is a professor emeritus at the Queen Mary University of
London, which is located about 3 km away from the City of London and
about 10 km away from the headquarters of MI6. It's not very damning
information by itself, but the London area is the UK equivalent of the
DC area where the headquarters of various intelligence agencies are
located, so people who live in the London area might be more likely to
have intelligence connections than people who live in more remote
regions of the UK. Clare Craig and Jonathan Engler also live in the
London area according to their LinkedIn profiles.</p>

<a href=#BBC_documentary_with_Hannah_Fry_and_David_Spiegelhalter id=BBC_documentary_with_Hannah_Fry_and_David_Spiegelhalter>BBC
documentary with Hannah Fry and David Spiegelhalter</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2015 BBC released a mainstream documentary about climate change
that was presented by Norman Fenton, Hannah Fry, and David
Spiegelhalter:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jsdrk>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jsdrk</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fentondoc-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In 2022 Hannah Fry hosted a BBC documentary which criticized
anti-vaxxers:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019g27>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019g27</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fentondoc-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In 2018 BBC released a documentary that starred Hannah Fry titled
<span class="quote">"Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/12/contagion-pandemic>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/12/contagion-pandemic</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The groundbreaking BBC Four experiment uses app technology to <span
class="quote">'infect'</span> users whilst tracking their movements and
social interactions over 24 hours. The information collected from the
app could inform public health policy and help save lives during the
next pandemic. But will Hannah persuade enough people nationwide to
download it? If she does, this will allow a team of mathematicians from
the University of Cambridge to create a simulation of how a deadly flu
virus could spread across the UK, predicting how many of us will be
infected - and how many might die.</p>
<p>Whilst Hannah masterminds the experiment and adopts the role of
Patient Zero - walking the streets of Haslemere in Surrey to launch the
outbreak - Javid finds out why flu is such a danger to society. He meets
the researchers trying to discover what makes some people more
contagious than others and visits a factory that will produce vaccine
when the next pandemic virus emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the BBC documentary Hannah Fry seeded a fictional pandemic in the
borough of Haslemere, which in February 2020 was reported to be the
location of the first COVID case with a UK origin (when cases in people
who were infected outside the UK and brought the virus to the UK were
excluded).
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51683428>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51683428</a>]
It's fairly likely to be a coincidence, but on the other hand the
borough of Haslemere has a population of only about 20,000.</p>
<p>In 2025 Hannah Fry joined Cambridge as a <span
class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of
Mathematics"</span>, but before it she was an associate professor at
another college in London.
[<a href=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hannah-fry-joins-cambridge-as-professor-of-the-public-understanding-of-mathematics>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hannah-fry-joins-cambridge-as-professor-of-the-public-understanding-of-mathematics</a>]
Wikipedia says that Fry's work <span class="quote">"has included studies
of patterns of human behaviour, such as interpersonal relationships and
dating, and how mathematics can apply to them"</span>. But before COVID,
Fenton and Neil also published popularized articles about Bayesian
analysis applied to topics like soccer, and they had a blog written for
a popular audience. So both Fenton and Fry had an appropriate background
to present information about COVID to a lay audience, even though they
may have been cast to play roles on opposite sides of the debate (but
that is only speculation and I don't yet have good evidence it's
actually the case).</p>
<p>In 2019 Fenton wrote a review of a book by Hannah Fry:
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331812193>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331812193</a>,
<a href=https://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.com/2019/03/hannah-frys-hello-world-and-example-of.html>https://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.com/2019/03/hannah-frys-hello-world-and-example-of.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fenton-fry.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the replies of the tweet where Fenton wrote that he had attended
several seminars on combating misinformation, Fenton's coauthor Scott
McLachlan wrote: <span class="quote">"You'll recall I attended several
too. A noteable one was that of <span class="citation"
data-cites="d_spiegel">@d_spiegel</span> who had the temerity to
complain because I pointed out that he offered no proof to support his
misinformation examples beyond that it was misinformation because he or
similar <span class="quote">'clever'</span> folks said it was"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/LawHealthTech/status/1829139475202506974>https://x.com/LawHealthTech/status/1829139475202506974</a>]
He referred to David Spiegelhalter, who was the third person who
presented the BBC documentary about climate change together with Fenton
and Hannah Fry.</p>
<p>David Spiegelhalter is a <span class="quote">"Professor of the Public
Understanding of Risk"</span> at Cambridge, and Hannah Fry is a <span
class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of
Mathematics"</span> at Cambridge. I didn't find any other professors of
public understanding at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Spiegelhalter, Fry, and Fenton were all prominent public commentators
on COVID-related issues. Spiegelhalter wrote a weekly column about COVID
statistics, and he wrote a book titled <span class="quote">"Covid By
Numbers: Making Sense of the Pandemic with Data"</span>.</p>
<p>In 2020 Spiegelhalter posted a tweet that said: <span
class="quote">"<span class="quote">'the most consistent predictor of
decreased susceptibility to misinformation about Covid-19 was numerical
literacy'</span> - great study (COI, by my colleagues)
<a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201199>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201199</a>
Data literacy is vital"</span>. The last author of the paper he linked
was Sander van der Linden. In 2019 van der Linden and Spiegelhalter were
featured as authors of a paper titled <span class="quote">"Communicating
uncertainty about facts, numbers and science"</span>, where they wrote
about Bayesian analysis applied to science communication, which is
similar to Fenton and Neil's area of expertise.
[<a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181870>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181870</a>]
The authors of the paper also included Alexandra Freeman, who was the
producer of the BBC documentary that was presented by Fenton, Fry, and
Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p>Spiegelhalter, van der Linden, and Freeman coauthored two papers that
were published by the Journal of Risk Research, but the same journal has
also published multiple papers by Neil and Fenton.
[<a href=https://exaly.com/journal/19864/journal-of-risk-research/top-authors/most-cited/lifetime>https://exaly.com/journal/19864/journal-of-risk-research/top-authors/most-cited/lifetime</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Added in March 2025: Fenton published a Substack post about his
involvement in the BBC documentary about climate change:
<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/climate-change-by-numbers-10-years.><a

<h2>
<a href=#Nudge_expert_Magda_Osman id=Nudge_expert_Magda_Osman>Nudge
expert Magda Osman</a>
</h2>
<p>The psychologist Magda Osman was previously faculty at the Queen Mary
University of London, and she has coauthored many papers with Fenton,
including several papers about COVID.
[<a href=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=norman+fenton+magda+osman>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=norman+fenton+magda+osman</a>]
In June 2021 McLachlan, Osman, Fenton, and three other people from Queen
Mary University published a preprint titled <span
class="quote">"Analysis of COVID-19 vaccine death reports from the
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) Database Interim:
Results and Analysis"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 Magda Osman was the first author of a paper published by
Journal of Risk Research titled <span class="quote">"People's
understanding of the concept of misinformation"</span>, and in 2024
Osman published a paper titled <span class="quote">"Public Evaluations
of Misinformation and Motives for Sharing It"</span>.
[<a href=https://bmeder.org/publication/2022-03-18_osman_et_al-2022-misinformation/2022-03-18_Osman_et_al-2022-misinformation.pdf>https://bmeder.org/publication/2022-03-18_osman_et_al-2022-misinformation/2022-03-18_Osman_et_al-2022-misinformation.pdf</a>,
<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5172/5/2/50>https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5172/5/2/50</a>]
In 2020 Osman, McLachlan, Fenton, Neil, and two other authors published
a paper about nudging as a strategy of behavior modification. Queen Mary
University of London published an article about the paper, where they
quoted Magda Osman as saying: <span class="quote">"We believe that
causal analysis can advance existing behaviour change frameworks as they
allow us to formally model behaviour change problems and the context in
which these interventions are situated. By incorporating these
approaches into the early design of behavioural interventions, we can
begin to understand what factors are relevant to the success of the
intervention and how the intervention could influence these factors, and
even prepare precautionary measures to help avoid failure."</span>
[<a href=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/news/items/nudges-fail-more-often-than-is-reported-experts-warn.html>https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/news/items/nudges-fail-more-often-than-is-reported-experts-warn.html</a>]</p>
<p>Magda Osman wrote on her website that her areas of research include
<span class="quote">"examining effectiveness of methods of behavioural
change"</span> and <span class="quote">"why nudges are not the answer to
effective wide scale behavioural change"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.magdaosman.com/>https://www.magdaosman.com/</a>]
She also wrote: <span class="quote">"I have been working with Fuel (an
arts based company) for several years now on several exciting projects,
the most recent of which was <span class="quote">'the lab'</span> which
is a Wellcome Trust funded project that helps bring life sciences
researchers and artists together to work on innovating and representing
scientific ideas to mass audiences."</span> And she wrote: <span
class="quote">"I spent the day with the newly appointed government in
this arts project, in which as scientific advisor I presented with them
several interventions informed by behavioural change frameworks (like
Nudge) to solve a social policy problem."</span></p>
<p>Magda Osman's THE LAB project commissioned three art projects. One of
them was about vaccines and another was about misinformation. The
projects started in August 2020, even though vaccines were not yet a
very common topic of discussion at the time:

<div>
<img src=i/turbo-vaccinium.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In 2018 Fenton and Neil coauthored another paper with Magda Osman
about nudging as a technique of behavioral change. The abstract of the
paper said: <span class="quote">"Social policy interventions, such as
nudges (behavioral change techniques), have gained significant traction
globally. But what do the public think? Does the type of expert
proposing a nudge influence the kinds of evaluations the public make
about nudges? Three experiments investigated this by presenting U.S.
(N = 689) and U.K. (N = 978) samples with descriptions of nudges
(genuine and fictitious) proposed by either scientists or the
government. Overall, compared to opaque and fictitious nudges,
transparent and genuine nudges were judged more ethical and plausible,
and scientists proposing them were judged more trustworthy than a
government working group. Also, trust in fictitious interventions
proposed by scientists was higher than in genuine interventions proposed
by a government working group."</span>
[<a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2018.1469986>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2018.1469986</a>]
Queen Mary University of London published an article about the paper,
where they quoted Fenton as saying <span class="quote">"While people
judged genuine nudges as more plausible than fictitious nudges, people
trusted some fictitious nudges proposed by scientists as more plausible
than genuine nudges proposed by government"</span> (which sounds just
like alt media, where people readily believe outlandish claims as long
as the source of the claim is a former chief scientist at Pfizer, or the
inventor of the PCR test, or great Bayesian eggheads from London).

<p>In 2023 the BBC published a radio program presented by Magda Osman,
where she discussed the future of nudging as a method of behavior
modification.
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001slsl>https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001slsl</a>]
Even though she introduced herself as a critic of the method of nudging,
she discussed both the pros and cons of nudging, and overall she
presented nudging in a mostly favorable light. Osman has also written
articles published by BBC, and she has been a guest on TV programs by
BBC and Channel 4, and she was a guest on the YouTube channel of the
rapper Zuby.</p>

partnership with QinetiQ</a>
</h2>
<p>The main product of Fenton and Neil's company Agena is the AgenaRisk
software. The software was originally developed in 2001-2004 under the
name MODIST, until it was commercialized by Fenton and Neil's company
Agena in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2003 a paper about MODIST was coauthored by three people from
QinetiQ Consulting, who were Lisa Tipping, David Milledge, and John
Elliot.
[<a href=https://conference.eurospi.net/images/proceedings/EuroSPI2003_ISBN-3-901351-84-1.pdf>https://conference.eurospi.net/images/proceedings/EuroSPI2003_ISBN-3-901351-84-1.pdf</a>]
The paper said that QinetiQ was <span class="quote">"the lead partner of
the MODIST project"</span>, and that MODIST was managed by David
Milledge from QinetiQ. QinetiQ was also listed as the coordinator of
MODIST on the website of the European Commission.
[<a href=https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28749>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28749</a>]</p>
<p>Another article about MODIST said: <span class="quote">"The prototype
was available fairly early on in the project lifetime, which enabled it
to be trialled in fifteen different software development projects. The
tool has now been commercialised and is available from one of the
partners, Agena, under the name of Agena Risk."</span>

<p>The partners of the MODIST project were Agena, Israel Aerospace
Industries, Philips, and QinetiQ.

QinetiQ is a UK private defense and intelligence company. Israel
Aerospace Industries is Israel's largest aerospace and defense company,
which primarily produces military aircraft and drones.</p>
<p>In 2020 QinetiQ signed a special security agreement with the US
Defense Counterintelligence &amp; Security Agency (DCSA).

<p>In 2001 the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) split off
into the private company QinetiQ and the public agency Defence Science

both halves of the former DERA. Martin Neil has also consulted for both
QinetiQ and DSTL according to his old bio: <span class="quote">"Martin

<p>Fenton and Neil were consultants to the BARD project, which was part
of IARPA's Project CREATE. A short paper about BARD said: <span
class="quote">"We present our new methodology and application, Bayesian
ARgumentation via Delphi (BARD), which combines BNs with a Delphi social
process: a systematic method for combining multiple perspectives in a
democratic, reasoned, iterative manner [Linstone and Turoff, 1975]. The
initial motivation for BARD was to extend the use of BNs to a new
domain: intelligence analysis. Development began as part of the
Crowdsourcing Evidence, Argumentation, Thinking and Evaluation (CREATE)
program funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
(IARPA). CREATE sought to develop, and experimentally test, systems that
use crowdsourcing and structured analytic techniques to improve analytic
reasoning, and help users to communicate it, without requiring prior
expertise or expert assistance."</span>

<p>Birtles said: <span class="quote">"I have known Tristan Crawford,
AERALIS' Founder &amp; CEO for about 30 years and I have always been
amazed &amp; impressed by his encyclopaedic knowledge, passion &amp;
enthusiasm for aerospace &amp; aircraft design. About 5 years ago,
Tristan introduced me to his concept of what he initially called Dart
Jet, which he had been working on quietly in his spare time for about 3
years. Soon afterwards - at my installation dinner as Master of the IT
Livery Company - Tristan sat next to a couple of other guests of mine,
one of whom had flown in the Fleet Air Arm, then for British Airways as
a 747 Captain and another who had actual experience of designing &amp;
building his own aircraft. Tristan explained his idea for a new jet
trainer aircraft to them and they both thought it was an idea with real
potential and so encouraged Tristan to pursue it further, so from this,
AERALIS was born in the summer of 2015."</span>

Birtles said he was good friends with another Past Master of the IT
Livery Company called Michael Webster. The other Past Master guy said
that one of his best golf buddies was Brian Hibbert, who was the
managing director of a British defense manufacturer called Insys, so the
Past Master guy arranged for Hibbert to meet Crawford, and Hibbert ended
up investing money to AERALIS and becoming their chairman.
