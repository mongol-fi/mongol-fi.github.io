<a href=#Short_version id=Short_version>Short version</a>
</h2>
<p>Fenton wrote that <span class="quote">"Between 2016 and 2022, I
attended many research seminars in the UK on using AI and Machine
Learning to <span class="quote">'combat misinformation'</span>."</span>
His coauthor Scott McLachlan replied that <span class="quote">"you'll
recall I attended several too"</span> and that one of the seminars was
organized by David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p>In 2015 Fenton, Spiegelhalter, and Hannah Fry were the three stars of
a BBC documentary about climate change, where they presented the
mainstream view on climate change from a numerical point of view.
Spiegelhalter later wrote a book about COVID statistics. Hannah Fry was
the star of a BBC documentary released in 2018, where she played the
role of a patient zero who seeded a fictional pandemic in the town of
Haslemere, but in 2020 the same town became the location of the first
documented COVID case with a UK origin. In 2022 Hannah Fry was the star
of a BBC documentary which criticized anti-vaxxers. In 2019 Fenton wrote
a paper where he reviewed a book by Hannah Fry.</p>
<p>In 2020 Spiegelhalter promoted a paper which analyzed suspectibility
to misinformation about COVID. The senior author of the paper was Sander
van der Linden, who has coauthored three papers together with
Spiegelhalter and the producer of the BBC documentary about climate
change. One of the papers dealt with Bayesian analysis applied to
science communication, and two of the papers were published by the
Journal of Risk Research which has also published multiple papers by
Fenton and Neil.</p>
<p>Fenton has coauthored multiple papers with the psychologist Magda
Osman, who is specialized in researching misinformation and the nudge
method. Fenton coauthored papers about the nudge method with her in 2018
and 2020. Osman said that a purpose of the other paper was to help
design efficient means of behavioral intervention. In 2020 she
coordinated a project funded by Wellcome Trust, where she explored how
scientists can collaborate with artists to engage the public on topics
related to life sciences. Her project commissioned three art projects,
one of which was about vaccines and the other was about misinformation.
She wrote that <span class="quote">"I spent the day with the newly
appointed government in this arts project, in which as scientific
advisor I presented with them several interventions informed by
behavioural change frameworks (like Nudge) to solve a social policy
problem."</span></p>
<p>The main product of Fenton and Neil's company Agena is the AgenaRisk
software, which was originally developed under the name MODIST until it
was commercialized by Fenton and Neil's company. The lead partner of the
MODIST project was the military and intelligence contractor QinetiQ, and
the other partners were Agena, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Philips.
A paper about MODIST was coauthored by three people from QinetiQ. Fenton
also worked with QinetiQ on a program to predict military vehicle
reliability. Agena has also worked with BAE, DSTL, and Untited States
Strategic Command.</p>
<p>Fenton and Neil served as consultants to IARPA Project CREATE, which
included a subproject where the authors modified AgenaRisk to create a
Bayesian reasoning software to serve intelligence applications. The
Cicada 3301 member Defango also took part in IARPA Project CREATE.</p>
<p>The chairman of Agena from 2004 until 2020 was Nicholas Birtles, who
started an aerospace defense company called AERALIS together with his
stepson who previously worked at QinetiQ. Birtles is a Past Master of
The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, which is a City of
London livery company which has a program to find civilian employment
for members of the Royal Corps of Signals, and which is also affiliated
with the Joint Forces Cyber Group and the Maritime Cyber Support Unit.
Funding for AERALIS was provided by a golf buddy of another Past Master
of the livery company, who was the director of a British defense
manufacturer called Insys.</p>

<p>Fenton posted a tweet where he wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Between 2016 and 2022, I attended many research seminars in the UK on
using AI and Machine Learning to <span class="quote">'combat
misinformation'</span>. The example of Hunter Biden's laptop was
invariably used as a key <span class="quote">'learning'</span> example
so algorithms classified it as <span
class="quote">'misinformation'</span>, <span class="quote">'Russian
propaganda'</span>, <span class="quote">'Trump lies'</span>. Moreover,
anybody pushing that story was classified as a <span
class="quote">'spreader of misinformation'</span>, <span
class="quote">'conspiracy theorist'</span> etc. In fact, most of the
common <span class="quote">'training'</span> examples that were used -
many of which were based on things Trump supposedly said, as well as
about Covid - turned out to be true. So an enormous amount of research
was (and is still) spent on developing <span
class="quote">'clever'</span> algorithms which simply censor the truth
online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seminars Fenton described sound like they might have somehow been
linked to intelligence services. Did he also attend seminars on how to
produce disinformation in order to combat inconvenient information?</p>
<p>In an article where the Canadian government and military contractor
Calian described their services of producing disinformation, they wrote
that their training on information operations focuses on understanding
how adversaries use disinformation, which sounds similar to the content
of the seminars Fenton attended: <span class="quote">"Training on
information operations should focus on understanding how adversaries use
disinformation, who they are targeting, with what messaging and what
effect they are trying to achieve. As mentioned earlier, disinformation
is a deliberate process. Training for disinformation can help us unravel
the intention, target and likely outcomes the authors and spreaders of
disinformation are seeking to achieve."</span>

<p>Fenton is a professor emeritus at the Queen Mary University of
London, which is located about 3 km away from the City of London and
about 10 km away from the headquarters of MI6. The London area is the UK
equivalent of the DC area where the headquarters of various intelligence
agencies are located, so people who live in the London area might be
more likely to have intelligence connections than people who live in
more remote regions of the UK. Clare Craig and Jonathan Engler also live
in the London area according to their LinkedIn profiles.</p>

documentary with Hannah Fry and David Spiegelhalter</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2015 BBC released a documentary called <span
class="quote">"Climate Change by Numbers"</span>, which supported the
mainstream view about climate change. The documentary was presented by
Norman Fenton, Hannah Fry, and David Spiegelhalter:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jsdrk>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bbc.<wbr>co.<wbr>uk/<wbr>programmes/<wbr>p02jsdrk</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fentondoc-1.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In 2018 BBC released a documentary presented by Hannah Fry titled
<span class="quote">"Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic"</span>. BBC's
website says:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/12/contagion-pandemic>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bbc.<wbr>co.<wbr>uk/<wbr>mediacentre/<wbr>proginfo/<wbr>2018/<wbr>12/<wbr>contagion-<wbr>pandemic</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The groundbreaking BBC Four experiment uses app technology to <span
class="quote">'infect'</span> users whilst tracking their movements and
social interactions over 24 hours. The information collected from the
app could inform public health policy and help save lives during the
next pandemic. But will Hannah persuade enough people nationwide to
download it? If she does, this will allow a team of mathematicians from
the University of Cambridge to create a simulation of how a deadly flu
virus could spread across the UK, predicting how many of us will be
infected - and how many might die.</p>
<p>Whilst Hannah masterminds the experiment and adopts the role of
Patient Zero - walking the streets of Haslemere in Surrey to launch the
outbreak - Javid finds out why flu is such a danger to society. He meets
the researchers trying to discover what makes some people more
contagious than others and visits a factory that will produce vaccine
when the next pandemic virus emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the BBC documentary Hannah Fry seeded a fictional pandemic in the
borough of Haslemere. In February 2020 Haslemere was reported to be the
location of the first COVID case with a UK origin, if cases in people
who were infected outside the UK and brought the virus to the UK were
excluded.
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51683428>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bbc.<wbr>com/<wbr>news/<wbr>uk-<wbr>51683428</a>]
It's fairly likely to be a coincidence, but on the other hand Haslemere
has a population of only about 20,000.</p>
<p>In 2022 Hannah Fry hosted a BBC documentary which criticized
anti-vaxxers:
[<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019g27>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bbc.<wbr>co.<wbr>uk/<wbr>programmes/<wbr>m0019g27</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fentondoc-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In 2025 Hannah Fry joined Cambridge as a <span
class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of
Mathematics"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hannah-fry-joins-cambridge-as-professor-of-the-public-understanding-of-mathematics>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>cam.<wbr>ac.<wbr>uk/<wbr>research/<wbr>news/<wbr>hannah-<wbr>fry-<wbr>joins-<wbr>cambridge-<wbr>as-<wbr>professor-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>public-<wbr>understanding-<wbr>of-<wbr>mathematics</a>]
Wikipedia says that Fry's work <span class="quote">"has included studies
of patterns of human behaviour, such as interpersonal relationships and
dating, and how mathematics can apply to them"</span>.
[<a href=https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Fry>https://<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Hannah_<wbr>Fry</a>]
Before COVID, Fenton and Neil also published popularized articles about
Bayesian analysis applied to topics like soccer, and they had a blog
written for a popular audience. So both Fenton and Fry had an
appropriate background to present information about COVID to a lay
audience, even though they may have been cast to play roles on opposite
sides of the debate (but that is only speculation and I don't yet have
good evidence it's actually the case).</p>
<p>In 2019 Fenton published a paper where he reviewed a book by Hannah
Fry:
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331812193>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>researchgate.<wbr>net/<wbr>publication/<wbr>331812193</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/turbo-fenton-fry.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>In the replies of the tweet where Fenton wrote that he had attended
several seminars on combating misinformation, Fenton's coauthor Scott
McLachlan wrote: <span class="quote">"You'll recall I attended several
too. A noteable one was that of <span class="citation"
data-cites="d_spiegel">@d_spiegel</span> who had the temerity to
complain because I pointed out that he offered no proof to support his
misinformation examples beyond that it was misinformation because he or
similar <span class="quote">'clever'</span> folks said it was"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/LawHealthTech/status/1829139475202506974>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>LawHealthTech/<wbr>status/<wbr>1829139475202506974</a>]
McLachlan referred to David Spiegelhalter, who was the third person who
presented the BBC documentary about climate change together with Fenton
and Hannah Fry.</p>
<p>David Spiegelhalter is a <span class="quote">"Professor of the Public
Understanding of Risk"</span> at Cambridge, and Hannah Fry is a <span
class="quote">"Professor of the Public Understanding of
Mathematics"</span> at Cambridge. I didn't find any other professors of
public understanding at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Spiegelhalter, Fry, and Fenton were all prominent public commentators
on COVID-related issues. Spiegelhalter wrote a weekly column about COVID
statistics, and he wrote a book titled <span class="quote">"Covid By
Numbers: Making Sense of the Pandemic with Data"</span>.</p>
<p>In 2020 Spiegelhalter posted a tweet that said: <span
class="quote">"<span class="quote">'the most consistent predictor of
decreased susceptibility to misinformation about Covid-19 was numerical
literacy'</span> - great study (COI, by my colleagues)
<a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201199>https://<wbr>r<wbr>o<wbr>y<wbr>a<wbr>l<wbr>s<wbr>o<wbr>c<wbr>i<wbr>e<wbr>t<wbr>y<wbr>p<wbr>u<wbr>b<wbr>l<wbr>i<wbr>s<wbr>h<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>g<wbr>.<wbr>org/<wbr>doi/<wbr>10.<wbr>1098/<wbr>rsos.<wbr>201199</a>

The senior author of the paper he linked was Sander van der Linden. In
2019 van der Linden and Spiegelhalter were featured as authors of a
paper titled <span class="quote">"Communicating uncertainty about facts,
numbers and science"</span>.
[<a href=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181870>https://<wbr>r<wbr>o<wbr>y<wbr>a<wbr>l<wbr>s<wbr>o<wbr>c<wbr>i<wbr>e<wbr>t<wbr>y<wbr>p<wbr>u<wbr>b<wbr>l<wbr>i<wbr>s<wbr>h<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>g<wbr>.<wbr>org/<wbr>doi/<wbr>10.<wbr>1098/<wbr>rsos.<wbr>181870</a>]
The paper dealt with Bayesian analysis applied to science communication,
which is similar to Fenton and Neil's area of expertise. The authors of
the paper also included Alexandra Freeman, who was the producer of the
BBC documentary that was presented by Fenton, Fry, and
Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p>Spiegelhalter, van der Linden, and Freeman coauthored two papers that
were published by the Journal of Risk Research, but the same journal has
also published multiple papers by Neil and Fenton.

<hr />
<p>Added in March 2025: Fenton published a Substack post about his
involvement in the BBC documentary about climate change:

<h2>
<a href=#Nudge_expert_Magda_Osman id=Nudge_expert_Magda_Osman>Nudge

<p>Fenton has coauthored many papers with the psychologist Magda Osman,
who used to be a faculty member at the Queen Mary University of London.

In June 2021, McLachlan, Osman, Fenton, and three other people from
Queen Mary University published a preprint about vaccine deaths at
VAERS.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>researchgate.<wbr>net/<wbr>publication/<wbr>352837543_<wbr>Analysis_<wbr>of_<wbr>COVID-<wbr>19_<wbr>vaccine_<wbr>death_<wbr>reports_<wbr>from_<wbr>the_<wbr>Vaccine_<wbr>Adverse_<wbr>Events_<wbr>Reporting_<wbr>System_<wbr>VAERS_<wbr>Database_<wbr>Interim_<wbr>Results_<wbr>and_<wbr>Analysis</a>]</p>
<p>Magda Osman is a researcher of misinformation, which is interesting
considering how Fenton and McLachlan attended several seminars about
combating misinformation. In 2022 Magda Osman was the first author of a
paper published by Journal of Risk Research titled <span
class="quote">"People's understanding of the concept of
misinformation"</span>, and in 2024 Osman published a paper titled <span
class="quote">"Public Evaluations of Misinformation and Motives for

<p>In 2020, Osman, McLachlan, Fenton, Neil, and two other authors
published a paper about nudging as a strategy of behavior modification.
Queen Mary University of London published an article about the paper,
where they quoted Magda Osman as saying: <span class="quote">"We believe
that causal analysis can advance existing behaviour change frameworks as
they allow us to formally model behaviour change problems and the
context in which these interventions are situated. By incorporating
these approaches into the early design of behavioural interventions, we
can begin to understand what factors are relevant to the success of the

even prepare precautionary measures to help avoid failure."</span>

So even though she presented herself as a critic of the nudge method,
the reason why she appears to have been critical of the method was
because it sometimes failed as a method of behavior modification, and
not because she thought that the government had no business engaging in
covert schemes of behavior modification.</p>
<p>In 2018 Fenton and Neil coauthored another paper with Magda Osman
about nudging as a technique of behavior modification. The abstract of
the paper said: <span class="quote">"Social policy interventions, such
as nudges (behavioral change techniques), have gained significant
traction globally. But what do the public think? Does the type of expert
proposing a nudge influence the kinds of evaluations the public make
about nudges? Three experiments investigated this by presenting U.S. (N
= 689) and U.K. (N = 978) samples with descriptions of nudges (genuine
and fictitious) proposed by either scientists or the government.
Overall, compared to opaque and fictitious nudges, transparent and
genuine nudges were judged more ethical and plausible, and scientists
proposing them were judged more trustworthy than a government working
group. Also, trust in fictitious interventions proposed by scientists
was higher than in genuine interventions proposed by a government
working group."</span>
[<a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2018.1469986>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>tandfonline.<wbr>com/<wbr>doi/<wbr>abs/<wbr>10.<wbr>1080/<wbr>01973533.<wbr>2018.<wbr>1469986</a>]
Queen Mary University of London published an article about the paper,
where they quoted Fenton as saying <span class="quote">"While people
judged genuine nudges as more plausible than fictitious nudges, people
trusted some fictitious nudges proposed by scientists as more plausible
than genuine nudges proposed by government"</span> (which sounds just
like alt media, where people readily believe outlandish claims as long
as the source of the claim is a former chief scientist at Pfizer, or the
inventor of the PCR test, or great Bayesian eggheads from London).

<p>Magda Osman wrote on her website that her areas of research include
<span class="quote">"examining effectiveness of methods of behavioural
change"</span> and <span class="quote">"why nudges are not the answer to
effective wide scale behavioural change"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.magdaosman.com/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>magdaosman.<wbr>com/<wbr></a>]
She also wrote: <span class="quote">"I have been working with Fuel (an
arts based company) for several years now on several exciting projects,
the most recent of which was <span class="quote">'the lab'</span> which
is a Wellcome Trust funded project that helps bring life sciences
researchers and artists together to work on innovating and representing
scientific ideas to mass audiences."</span> And she continued: <span
class="quote">"I spent the day with the newly appointed government in
this arts project, in which as scientific advisor I presented with them
several interventions informed by behavioural change frameworks (like
Nudge) to solve a social policy problem."</span></p>
<p>Magda Osman was the <span class="quote">"academic lead"</span> of THE
LAB project. The paper about the project said: <span class="quote">"THE
LAB was produced and coordinated by Fuel, partnered with Queen Mary
University of London, and supported by Wellcome Trust, and Arts Council
England. The objective of THE LAB was to pilot a process for
coordinating small scale collaborations between two types of experts:
scientists and artists. The outputs from these collaborations were
artistic, and were designed with the aim of engaging the public on
topics themed around life sciences that directly impact our lives
(e.g. global health, public health). Given that the planning of THE LAB
started in January 2020, the themes were prescient."</span>
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313024233/https://www.magdaosman.com/_files/ugd/8b1381_695ef92003a8487fb1b80584662c6038.pdf>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20220313024233/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>magdaosman.<wbr>com/_<wbr>files/<wbr>ugd/<wbr>8b1381_<wbr>6<wbr>9<wbr>5<wbr>e<wbr>f<wbr>9<wbr>2<wbr>0<wbr>0<wbr>3<wbr>a<wbr>8<wbr>4<wbr>8<wbr>7<wbr>f<wbr>b<wbr>1<wbr>b<wbr>8<wbr>0<wbr>5<wbr>8<wbr>4<wbr>6<wbr>6<wbr>2<wbr>c<wbr>6<wbr>0<wbr>3<wbr>8<wbr>.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<p>THE LAB project commissioned three art projects, one of which was
about vaccines and another was about misinformation. The projects
started in August 2020, even though vaccines were not yet a very common
topic of discussion at the time:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-vaccinium.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>So the purpose of Osman's project may have been to explore how
scientists can recruit artists to control the narrative about COVID
vaccines, where by scientists she may have meant researchers of behavior
modification or misinformation like herself, or the type of researchers
who would be employed to coordinate the public messaging about COVID
vaccines.</p>
<p>In 2023 the BBC published a radio program presented by Magda Osman,
where she discussed the future of nudging as a method of behavior
modification.
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001slsl>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bbc.<wbr>com/<wbr>audio/<wbr>play/<wbr>m001slsl</a>]
Even though she introduced herself as a critic of the nudge method, she
discussed both the pros and cons of nudging, and overall she presented
nudging in a mostly favorable light.</p>
<p>Osman has also written articles published by BBC, and she has been a
guest on TV programs by BBC and Channel 4, and she has been a guest on
the YouTube channel of the rapper Zuby. So like Fenton and
Spiegelhalter, she is somewhat of a public figure who does presentations
about science to a popular audience.</p>

<p>The main product of Fenton and Neil's company Agena is the AgenaRisk
software. The software was originally developed in 2001-2004 under the
name MODIST, until it was commercialized by Fenton and Neil's company
Agena in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2003 a paper about MODIST was coauthored by three people from
QinetiQ Consulting, who were Lisa Tipping, David Milledge, and John
Elliot.

The paper said that QinetiQ was <span class="quote">"the lead partner of
the MODIST project"</span>, and that MODIST was managed by David
Milledge from QinetiQ. The MODIST project was funded by the European
Commission, which listed QinetiQ as the coordinator of the project.

<p>Another article about MODIST said: <span class="quote">"The prototype
was available fairly early on in the project lifetime, which enabled it
to be trialled in fifteen different software development projects. The
tool has now been commercialised and is available from one of the
partners, Agena, under the name of Agena Risk."</span>

<p>Fenton and Neil served as consultants to an IARPA project where the
authors developed a Bayesian reasoning software called BARD. A paper
about BARD said: <span class="quote">"We present our new methodology and
application, Bayesian ARgumentation via Delphi (BARD), which combines
BNs with a Delphi social process: a systematic method for combining
multiple perspectives in a democratic, reasoned, iterative manner

extend the use of BNs to a new domain: intelligence analysis.
Development began as part of the Crowdsourcing Evidence, Argumentation,
Thinking and Evaluation (CREATE) program funded by the Intelligence
Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). CREATE sought to develop,
and experimentally test, systems that use crowdsourcing and structured
analytic techniques to improve analytic reasoning, and help users to
communicate it, without requiring prior expertise or expert
assistance."</span>

Birtles said he was good friends with another Past Master of the IT
Livery Company called Michael Webster. A golf buddy of the other Past
Master guy was Brian Hibbert, who was the director of a British defense
manufacturer called Insys, so the Past Master guy arranged for a meeting
between Birtles's stepson and the golf buddy, who ended up investing
money in AERALIS and becoming their chairman.

In 2024 Birtles was one of the people who organized WTIC's annual Royal
Signals Career workshop, where members of the Royal Corps of Signals
were mentored on opportunities to find civilian employment.

<p>The magazine of the Royal Corps of Signals said: <span
class="quote">"The WCIT sponsors an Apprentice of the Year medal, a
Yeoman of Signals Course prize, the Employment Panel (to date assisting
over 500 former R SIGNALS personnel into a second career) and the
Journeyman Scheme. This last initiative extends an opportunity for
selected R SIGNALS personnel to embark upon a mentored process to join
the WCIT as <span class="quote">'Freemen'</span>, guided by civilian IT
professionals. These mentors willingly volunteer their time to assist
personnel to develop their career profile and skills in a
readily-understood format by their civilian counterparts."</span>

<p>In 2013 Fenton made a website called <span class="quote">"Bayes and
the law"</span> together with Amber Marks, who is the co-director of the
Criminal Justice Centre at Queen Mary University of London.

Marks is the daughter of the infamous drug smuggler Howard Marks, who
according to Wikipedia was <span class="quote">"connected with groups as
diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia"</span>, and who was
recruited by the MI6 <span class="quote">"because of his connections in
the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan,
for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the
IRA"</span>.

<p>In the acknowledgments of their book about Bayesian analysis, Fenton
and Neil listed a Past Master of a City of London livery company, the
head of an IARPA project, the daughter of an infamous drug smuggler
recruited by MI6, and an expert on the nudge method:
