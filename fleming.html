<p>When someone asked Fleming to post his PhD thesis to show it wasn't
fake, Fleming replied simply <span class="quote">"Q-clearance"</span>
(which I presume meant he couldn't publish his thesis because it
contained classified information).
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1876722383400083499>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1876722383400083499</a>]
Fleming also told me: <span class="quote">"As far as my research for the
thesis, this was classified as Q-clearance in 1974. I have reached out
to Trump and others to work with him using this research."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882153774636028052>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882153774636028052</a>]
And later Fleming said: <span class="quote">"I myself agreed to make my
doctorate research Q-clearance because I could not envision humanity
using it for the peaceful purposes I had intended it to be used for. I
could only envision it being used for destructive purposes."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1893677446081269778>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1893677446081269778</a>]</p>
<p>The Twitter user LogarithmicDis found many problems with Fleming's
diploma:
[<a href=https://x.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1882133468500660348>https://x.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1882133468500660348</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On his website he has posted his <span class="quote">"highly
unusual"</span> PhD diploma that he started on supposedly at age 12, if
you subtract his birth year (posted online by him) from a 1968
matriculating date = 12 years old.</p>
<p>But the diploma has MANY problems.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>First, the doctor is a convicted felon and was sentenced for his
criminal acts and debarred by the FDA.</p>
<p><a href=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/omaha/press-releases/2009/om082009.htm>https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/omaha/press-releases/2009/om082009.htm</a></p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-2.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>So his honesty isn't exactly batting a thousand here. Upon closer
look at his CV posted on his website:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>And closer look at the unusual PhD diploma with contrast adjusted, we
see a copy and paste left hand signature rectangle and very unusual
seals.</p>
<p>But there are 12 total problems with this <span
class="quote">"diploma"</span> that I see:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-4.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>1. There is no such thing as <span class="quote">"The State
Universities of Iowa"</span>.</p>
<p>University of Iowa was in fact called <span class="quote">"State
University of Iowa"</span>.</p>
<p>Singular, not plural.</p>
<p><a href=https://iowaregents.edu/the-board/regents-history>https://iowaregents.edu/the-board/regents-history</a></p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>2. The copy &amp; paste left hand signatures (contrast adj).</p>
<p>3. The president of the Board of Regents was Mary Peterson in 1974.
So wrong name here.</p>
<p>4. The proper title is President, Board of Regents (not Board of
Education, a term that ceased in 1955).</p>
<p><a href=https://iowaregents.edu/the-board/regents-history>https://iowaregents.edu/the-board/regents-history</a></p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-6.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>5. The seals appear to not be original to the background</p>
<p>6. LT and RT seals do not fade w/the document (along w/the square
patch on left and e-signatures in right, addressed later).</p>
<p>7. The middle seal appears curved and uneven, like a poor patch
job.</p>
<p>8. Right seal is what?</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-7.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>9. Two electronic signatures are exactly the same font and
uncharacteristic of 1974.</p>
<p>10. Weird fine print at bottom with misspelling.</p>
<p>11. Executive order reference to JFK is strange on a diploma. Here
are JFK's EOs:</p>
<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_actions_by_John_F%2e_Kennedy>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_actions_by_John_F%2e_Kennedy</a></p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-9.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>12. UNI does not confer PhD degrees. It was formerly a teachers
college and confers only EdD degrees.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-10.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Here's his CV from <span class="citation"
data-cites="Doctor_I_am_The">@Doctor_I_am_The</span> federal criminal
court case in 2009.</p>
<p>He failed to update it.</p>

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-11.jpg width=400><img src=i/fleming-dis-12.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>I verified the diploma was fake with the regent universities. I
actually called (like that was necessary? lol 😂)</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>And the ridiculous statement at the bottom of Fleming's confirmed
fake degree is a complete joke.</p>
<p>Here are JFK's EO's that day.</p>
<p><a href=https://federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/john-f-kennedy/1963>https://federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/john-f-kennedy/1963</a></p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-13.jpg width=300>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The line at the bottom of the diploma says: <span class="quote">"This
Doctorate is issued for the recipient's work on plasma and positrons
pursuant to Executive Order APP#43 issued January 29, 1963 by John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the Unisted [sic] States of
America."</span> But the list of executive orders issued by JFK is
public, and it doesn't include any order number <span
class="quote">"APP#43"</span>.</p>
<p>I tried to check if the diploma featured fonts which had not yet been
published in 1974, but I believe the two fonts I was able to identify
had both been published before 1974 (even though it's possible that
Fleming would have used newer near-identical variants of the old fonts I
identified, because there's newer copycat versions of both fonts, but I
didn't bother doing a detailed investigation of the fonts).</p>
<p>The signatures of Francis F Chen and CD Anderson seem to have been
written in some version of the Brush Script font, which was designed in
1942:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-brush.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>At first I thought the blackletter font in the diploma was Monotype
Old English Text which was only published in 1990.
[<a href=https://www.myfonts.com/collections/old-english-text-font-monotype-imaging>https://www.myfonts.com/collections/old-english-text-font-monotype-imaging</a>]
However Monotype Old English Text is a clone of an older font called
Cloister Back that was designed around 1904, and based on the angle of
the upper left arm in the capital letter U, Fleming's font actually
seems closer to Cloister Black than to Monotype Old English:
[<a href=http://identifont.com/show?249>http://identifont.com/show?249</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-dis-fonts.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>When I linked to the thread by LogarithmicDis, Fleming told me: <span
class="quote">"This image of my doctoral diploma is clearly altered and
you are either guilty of altering it or guilty of presenting an altered
diploma. It's a new country. :-)"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882159478986170631>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882159478986170631</a>]
Fleming also told me: <span class="quote">"This doctorate was
manipulated by people on line. People who spend a lot of time
manipulating images including published research."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882153774636028052>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1882153774636028052</a>]
However I didn't find any way the images in the thread by LogarithmicDis
were manipulated apart from the adjustment of contrast which she
mentioned in her thread.</p>
<p>But perhaps Fleming was projecting his own sins onto his adversaries,
because at some point after LogarithmicDis posted her thread, Fleming
altered the image of his diploma on his website so that the background
of the signatures on the left and the two seals on the middle was
modified to match the background of the rest of the paper:

<div>

<p>The old version of the image where the backgrounds didn't match is
still available at the Wayback Machine:

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-diploma-old.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>When I asked Fleming about his PhD thesis, he told me to read his
book <span class="quote">"Are We the Next Endangered Species"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1878458620402151869>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1878458620402151869</a>]
I believe he wanted me to read the appendix in his book called <span
class="quote">"Fleming Doctorate Research and Training"</span>. However
I didn't find the book on Libgen or Anna's Archive, and it costs 27 USD
on Amazon, but I don't want to pay that much for a single book
chapter.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Twitter_accounts_ExperiencedStud_and_ImBodu id=Twitter_accounts_ExperiencedStud_and_ImBodu>Twitter

<p>Fleming used to have a Twitter account called ExperiencedStud where
he advertised his work as an actor and he tried to get casted in adult
films. There's no snapshots of the account at the Wayback Machine, but
Cheshire managed to take these screenshots of the account:
[<a href=https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1559607005848883200/photo/1>https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1559607005848883200/photo/1</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-stud-1.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Fleming actually managed to appear in any adult
movie, because one of his tweets from 2016 said: <span
class="quote">"I've been acting a couple years. Just started in porn a
few weeks ago after people told me for years I'm a natural. Looking to
be your talent"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1386706893788258313>https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1386706893788258313</a>]</p>
<p>Fleming said that the account was hacked, and that when people said
he was an adult actor, it just meant that he was not a child actor:
[<a href=https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1386712519436349440>https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1386712519436349440</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-stud-2.webp width=550>

<p>Fleming also claimed that the account was called <span

(The truncation theory is actually somewhat plausible, because when you
register a new account on Twitter, you are first asked to enter a
display name, and then Twitter automatically suggests a username based
on the display name which is truncated to at most 15 characters, and
<span class="quote">"ExperiencedStud"</span> happens to be 15 characters
long. But why would Fleming not have edited the username manually?)</p>
<p>However as evidence against Fleming's hacking theory, the court
documents of the Fleming v. Sims case said: <span
class="quote">"According to Larry Sims, the parties first came into
contact after Defendants placed a job posting on an adult entertainment
job listing website. (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 90 at 1-2, 124 at 1, 188 at 1,
234 at 1, 244 at 1.) Plaintiff allegedly responded to the advertisement
and represented himself as an adult film actor and model. (Id.)"</span>

<p>Fleming's current Twitter account used to be called MedicinesDarkK1
until October 2020.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=medicinesdarkk1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=medicinesdarkk1&amp;f=live</a>]
After that he briefly changed his username to Lys_og_sannhet (which
means <span class="quote">"light and truth"</span> in Norwegian) until
he settled with his current username Doctor_I_am_The.
[<a href=https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1331705114659229696>https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1331705114659229696</a>]
His old username was probably a reference to how Batman is called the
Dark Knight:

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-stud-3.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Fleming's IMDB profile has a photo where he poses as Batman and a
video where he poses as Joker:
[<a href=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6222842/mediaviewer/rm57834240/>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6222842/mediaviewer/rm57834240/</a>,

<p>There's an account with a Batman avatar created in May 2021 called
<span class="quote">"ImBodu"</span> (where the <span
class="quote">"Im"</span> seems to match <span
class="quote">"I_Am"</span> in the username of Fleming's main account).
ImBodu currently only has 12 tweets. Its display name is <span
class="quote">"im back for richards ass ANND his bodu"</span> and its
bio says <span class="quote">"He thought he could block me. But imma get
him"</span>. Cheshire suspected the account might have been created by
Fleming himself.
[<a href=https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1397312313531650050>https://x.com/Thatsregrettab1/status/1397312313531650050</a>]
The account seemed familiar with several of Fleming's short films, his
IMDB videos, and his YouTube videos, which likely few people besides
Fleming himself would know about. They supposedly included a Joker video
which would match the Batman theme, an audition video, a penis pump
video, and a video where Fleming exposed himself in a speedo. The Batman
account seems to have wanted Fleming to post his penis on the internet
again (which likely few people besides Fleming himself would be
interested in):

chi-squared comparison of Fleming FMTVDM method and mammography</a>
</h3>
<p>In 2019 Fleming published a paper titled <span
class="quote">"Statistical Demonstration that FMTVDM is Superior to
Mammography"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.remedypublications.com/open-access/statistical-demonstration-that-fmtvdm-is-superior-to-mammography-5186.pdf>https://www.remedypublications.com/open-access/statistical-demonstration-that-fmtvdm-is-superior-to-mammography-5186.pdf</a>]
FMTVDM stands for the <span class="quote">"Fleming Method for Tissue and
Vascular Differentiation and Metabolism"</span>, which Fleming claims
had a perfect accuracy of detecting breast cancer 1000 times out of 1000
when mammography detected breast cancer correctly only 828 times out of
1000:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-breast-1.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>In the table above the sum on the second row is wrong, because
<code>142+747</code> adds up to 889 and not 781. But that's the least of
Fleming's problems. The formula he used to calculate the chi-squared
test is also wrong, and it has two divisions by zero:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-breast-2.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>In his formula <span class="quote">"χ<sup>2</sup> = E
(O-E)2/E"</span>, the first <span class="quote">"E"</span> should've
been <span class="quote">"∑"</span> and the second number 2 should've
been superscripted: <span class="quote">"χ<sup>2</sup> =
∑((O-E)<sup>2</sup>/E)"</span>.</p>
<p>Fleming also misunderstood the meaning of the expected counts E in
the formula. He treated the results of FMTVDM as the expected counts and
he compared it to the results of mammography which he treated as the
observed counts. But his observed counts should've consisted of a
contingency matrix with one row for mammography and another row for his
Fleming method. And then he should've calculated the expected matrix
based on the observed matrix by doing a matrix multiplication of the row
sums and column sums and then dividing the result with the sum of all
values in the contingency matrix:</p>
<pre>&gt; m=rbind(mammography=c(77,34,747,142),Fleming_FMTVDM=c(111,0,889,0))

<p>Fleming claimed that his Twitter account had been hacked so that
someone had added a photo of David Icke to a poster for Fleming's Crimes

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-icke.webp width=550>

<p>But then was Fleming's Facebook account also hacked? The Facebook
account of the tour also has a poster that features David Icke:
[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/103054418992983/photos/142901295008295/>https://www.facebook.com/103054418992983/photos/142901295008295/</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-icke-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The tweet by Fleming that featured Icke was posted on June 17th 2022
UTC, and the Facebook post that featured Icke was posted on June 19th
2022 UTC.</p>
<p>David Icke's blog also has a post dated May 24th 2022 which says:
<span class="quote">"I am currently traveling the country with Drs. Judy
Mikovits, Richard Fleming and Reiner Fuellmich. Our one-day conference
topic in nine cities focuses on the case for crimes against humanity
having been committed by leaders of Big Pharma and the biosecurity
cartel."</span>

<p>Kevin McCairn was also featured on the tour, and he told me that he
asked Fleming to remove Icke. But even after that Fleming still denied
that Icke was ever included on the tour and said it was just <span
class="quote">"more photoshopping and hacking"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/NestCommander/status/1882872073883976179>https://x.com/NestCommander/status/1882872073883976179</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-icke-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>In 2022 Fleming even quoted the poster with Icke himself and referred
to Icke in his tweet. So if the image file of the poster was
photoshopped by the hackers, then did the hackers also edit Fleming's
the text of Fleming's tweet so that it referred to the photoshopped
poster?

<p>Before the paper about Fleming's fake trial was published in a
predatory journal, he published two preprint versions of the paper as
well as two accompanying short reports. Here's links to all of them for
the sake of convenience:</p>
<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Highlights: 23 sites, 7 countries, 1,800 patients, 10 treatment arms.
No other authors other than Fleming and son. None of the sites were
identified, although the ill-formatted tables (apparently due to
unfamiliarity with Acrobat) include Table 3 showing the country of the
sites. No funding was required for this study (?).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Clinicaltrials.gov site shows that on October 8,
the first author/sponsor changed the <span class="quote">"treatment arms
and interventions"</span> details on all of the tested protocols. This
is 3 weeks <em>after</em> the trial was marked concluded. An example of
the changes:</p>
<p>Experimental: Treatment 1 <strong>ORIGINAL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg po q 8 hrs (600 mg qD) for a total of
10-days, and Azithromycin 500 mg IV on day 1, followed by 250 mg IV on
days 2-5 (to prevent bacterial superinfection).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experimental: Treatment 1 <strong>REVISED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg po q 8 hrs (600 mg qD) for a total of
10-days , <strong>OR Hydroxychloroquine 155 mg IV every 8-hours (600 mg
qD) for 10-days if patient is intubated</strong> and Azithromycin 500 mg
IV on day 1, followed by 250 mg IV on days 2-5 (to prevent bacterial
superinfection). (emphasis added)</p>

<p>Other remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>While there is mention of centralized institutional board review
there is no mention of informed consent by patients or authorized
representatives</li>
<li>There does not seem to be any data provided as to the racial
demographics of the patients</li>
<li>Although 8 different Figures are referenced in the text, none appear
in the preprint</li>
<li>The author acknowledges 6 individuals (by initials only) for their
assistance with the <span class="quote">"individual patient

COVID-19 with 35% fewer patients than this one, acknowledged over 200

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheshire also pointed out that after the trial is supposed to have
already ended, Fleming changed the number of enrollees from 500 to 501
to 1,800:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trial ended on September 14; at which time clinical trials.gov showed
500 enrollees.</p>
<p>Dr. Fleming posted this on Twitter on September 24, showing 501
enrollees:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>On October 2, the sponsor (Dr. Fleming) changed the trial enrollment
number to 1,800 at clinicaltrials.gov and 1,800 is the figure used in
this preprint.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>However the discrepancy seems to be because Table 3 shows that the
total number of patients was 1,800, but 1,299 of them were outpatients
and the number of inpatients enrolled to phases I and II was 501:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-7.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Fleming wrote that <span class="quote">"NCT04349410 required
identification of a seven-person SARS-CoV-2 treatment team"</span>
(where presumably each site would've had its own <span
class="quote">"treatment team"</span> with at least seven persons, but
the study is supposed to have included 23 sites so 23 times 7 would be
161). Cheshire wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the extraordinary <em>requirement</em> that a 7-person
treatment team (see below) be formed to treat the 501 hospitalized
patients, how is it possible that all this additional care was provided
with no funding from the sponsor? Why was this <span
class="quote">"required identification"</span> not included as part of
the pre-registered trial protocols? What evidence does the sponsor have
that this <span class="quote">"required identification"</span> was
followed in every case?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Someone also posted this comment at PubPeer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that these ambiguities about the study's feasibility
and protocols are reminiscent of earlier skepticism, expressed 18 years
ago, about another purported clinical trial from the same author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...clinical trials are expensive, difficult and time-consuming. Even
small dietary trials can easily cost several hundred thousand dollars
and require entire research teams. The DPP estimated a cost of $1,075
just to recruit each participant. Fleming reports on a one-year trial of
100 participants and four diets with extensive follow-up. His paper,
however, has no co-authors; it acknowledges no source of funding, nor
any nurses, dietitians or technicians who might have helped. Fleming
identifies himself as Medical Director of Preventive Cardiology, the
Camelot Foundation at the Fleming Heart &amp; Health Institute, but if
his Web site or receptionist are any indication, he is the sole member
of each of those.</p>
<p>As for the issue of peer-review, Fleming states that his patients
<span class="quote">"were randomly assigned to one of the four dietary
regimens based upon dietary preferences."</span> This protocol is
pivotal to interpretation of the findings, yet oxymoronic: If patients
were assigned to diets based on their dietary preferences, then they
weren't randomly assigned. If they were randomly assigned, then their
preferences must be irrelevant. The two methods are incompatible. If
this paper was peer-reviewed, it was done poorly. If this constitutes
high-quality research in this field, then I suggest even more skepticism
is necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm confused again.</p>
<p>From the Methods section of this preprint (posted 10/27/20):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outpatient Treatment: Patient recruitment for each outpatient
treatment site is shown in Tables 3, 4 and Figure 2. Outpatient
treatment was by definition provided by clinicians prior to hospital
admission. Outpatient sites included private offices, physician and
hospital clinics. Decision to treat (Treatments 1-4; Tables 2A and 2B)
was made solely by the physician and patient. <strong>All outpatients
received a minimum of 200 mg of elemental zinc daily</strong> while
taking aminoquinolines. Following initial evaluation including PCR
testing and initiation of treatment or the decision to provide no
treatment, patients returned 3-5 days later for re-evaluation."
(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm puzzled how the treating physicians would have known to treat
patients with 200 mg of zinc daily? In the protocol document dated April
2020 (still available at clinicaltrials.gov), there is no mention of
pre-hospitalization or outpatient treatment. On July 4, 2020, an
Appendix G was added that added a prehospitalization step which
includes, <span class="quote">"<strong>Begin immune supportive Rx,
including Zn.</strong>"</span> No <em>quantity</em> of Zn is
specified.</p>
<p>Further in a late September YouTube video by the first author he
recommended <strong>10 mg of daily zinc</strong> for prehospitalized
COVID-19 patients.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>If the protocol provided to physicians at the outset of the trial did
not include prehospitalization instructions, but zinc (of unknown
quantity) was included beginning in July, and in late September (after
the conclusion of this study) the first author was recommending 10 mg
daily Zn... how can the author make the statement that <strong>all
outpatients received a minimum of 200 mg of elemental zinc
daily?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheshire pointed out that a table in Fleming's preprint indicated
that in all treatment groups patients received either 10 mg of zinc
orally or 4 mg of zinc intravenously:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-5.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>But Fleming responded by saying that his table showed the treatment
regime in hospitalized patients and not outpatients:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-6.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>However in case zinc was suspected to be helpful in treating COVID,
why was the dosage of zinc reduced from 200 mg to 10 mg after a patient
was hospitalized? In Fleming's YouTube video, he also recommended a
dosage of only 10 mg of zinc to outpatients.</p>

</h3>
<p>The abstract of Fleming's paper said: <span class="quote">"The three
successful treatment regimens include (1) Tocilizumab &amp; Interferon
a-2b, (2) Primaquine, Clindamycin, Tocilizumab &amp; Interferon a-2b,
and (3) Methylprednisolone. These three regimens were effective 99.83%
of the time and shortened hospital stays from 40 ± 3 days to 1-2
weeks."</span></p>
<p>It's not clear how he determined the baseline hospital stay of 40 ± 3
days, because his study did not have any control group. I found no other
reference to the figure of 40 ± 3 days apart from the abstract. The
average duration of 40 days seems far too high, and the standard
deviation of 3 days seems too narrow relative to the average
duration.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of COVID hospitalization studies from 2020 said:
<span class="quote">"We identified 52 studies, the majority from China
(46/52). Median hospital LoS [length of stay] ranged from 4 to 53 days
within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45
studies."</span>

A meta-analysis from 2021 said: <span class="quote">"The mean length of
hospital stay due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 12.5 days (SD
6.8)."</span>
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8206636/>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8206636/</a>]
A study from a hospital in Brazil said that the mean duration of
hospital stay was 10 ± 8 days.

<p>The conclusion of Fleming's paper said: <span
class="quote">"Successful treatment interventions focused on (1)
avoiding intubation or extubating the patient within a matter of days -
less than one week - to minimize the ARDS associated ventilator
complications associated with the immunologic ITR to SARS-CoV-2, in
addition to (2) using a combination of treatments within the first few
days of admission including Interferon a-2b, Tocilizumab, and
Methylprednisolone. These combinations were most effective if the
patient had already received an aminoquinoline as an outpatient, or
Primaquine as an inpatient. When provided the administration of
convalescent plasma proved effective; however, given the limited supply
of convalescent plasma, the potential consequences of a blood product
transfusion including increased potential for thrombosis as a plasma
product, and the availability of effective ITR treatments, convalescent
plasma should be reserved for cases not responding to Interferon a-2b,
Tocilizumab, Methylprednisolone, or the combination of Tocilizumab with
Interferon a-2b. These ITR drugs proved most promising when initiated
upon admission and when used in combination, reducing hospitalization
time from 30-45 days to as little as 18-25 days with 0.17%
mortality."</span></p>
<p>However 18 to 25 days is about 2.6 to 3.6 weeks, and not 1 to 2 weeks
like Fleming wrote in the abstract.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of 0.17% seems to match the figure of 99.83%
effectiveness Fleming mentioned in the abstract, so at first I thought
that by effectiveness Fleming simply meant the percentage of subjects
who did not die. Hovever then I thought I was wrong because I noticed
that his paper said: <span class="quote">"Successful treatment outcomes
were defined using the quantitative measurements of FMTVDM with a
reduction of ≥ 25, or a level of &lt; 150, Ferritin levels &lt; 270
ng/ml for men and &lt; 160 ng/ml for women, and an IL-6 level of &lt; 5
pg/ml."</span> But next I noticed that Fleming also wrote: <span
class="quote">"Three hundred and forty patients entered Phase I and
received sequentially added medical Treatment(s) until the patient
demonstrated treatment success or expired."</span> So apparently all of
his imaginary subjects are supposed to have been treated until they
either died or they recovered as measured by one of his three
biomarkers, which explains why his efficacy against death is the same as
his efficacy determined based on the biomarkers.</p>
<p>A mortality rate of 0.17% would correspond to 1 death per 570 to 606
people when rounded to the nearest digit. But I think the study didn't
even have 570 subjects who received any of Fleming's so-called <span
class="quote">"three successful treatment regimes"</span>. There were
only 501 inpatient subjects, and the section for outpatient treatment
said: <span class="quote">"Outpatient treatment was by definition
provided by clinicians prior to hospital admission. Outpatient sites
included private offices, physician and hospital clinics. Decision to
treat (Treatments 1-4; Tables 3A &amp; 3B) was made solely by the
physician and patient."</span> And Table 3A shows that none of Fleming's
<span class="quote">"three succesful treatment regimes"</span> were
given to outpatients, even though clindamycin alone was given to some
outpatients (in the imaginary realm where Fleming conducted his
trial):</p>

<p>Cheshire pointed out that people in all 11 treatment arms had the
same baseline levels of ferritin and IL-6 at admission:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-trial-8.jpg width=600>

<p>When I asked Fleming to explain it, he replied: <span
class="quote">"As explained in the paper, although clearly not read or
comprehended by others, all participants began at baseline. This was
baseline. They were then randomly assigned to treatments and then based
upon measured FMTVDM outcomes, additional treatments were added or not.

Then I asked him: <span class="quote">"Ok, so did you first measure the
ferritin level in each subject and then divided the subjects into
treatment arms so that each arm happened to have the same average
ferritin level with the same CI? It wouldn't be possible."</span> (Where
I should've said SD and not CI.) But Fleming replied: <span
class="quote">"You obviously are not very good at this and obviously
have not read the paper. The sequence was laid out in the paper. You act
like the typical student who has a reading assignment, shows up for
class not having read the assignment and then try to blame the professor
for your lack of understanding. Thus wasting your time, my time and
everyone else's time."</span></p>
<p>But I still don't understand how it's possible for each arm to have
the same levels of ferritin and IL-6 at admission.</p>

<p>According to this State of Nebraska <span class="quote">"Petition for

excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and all other federal
healthcare programs."</span></p>
<p>I verified that he is on the exclusion list accessible here:
<a href=https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/index.asp>https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/index.asp</a>
and that site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from
Federally funded health care programs for a variety of reasons,
including a conviction for Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Those that are
excluded can receive no payment from Federal healthcare programs for any
items or services they furnish, order, or prescribe. This includes those
that provide health benefits funded directly or indirectly by the United
States (other than the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan).</p>
<p>OIG maintains a list of all currently excluded individuals and
entities called the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE). Anyone
who hires an individual or entity on the LEIE may be subject to civil
monetary penalties (CMP). To avoid CMP liability, health care entities
should routinely check the list to ensure that new hires and current
employees are not on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this, it sounds unlikely that Fleming/Dr. who? would be in a
position to legally run a clinical trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However I don't know to what extent US regulations would've applied
to Fleming's trial since none of his imaginary trial sites were located
in the United States. There were 5 sites in India, 4 in Germany, 4 in
Brazil, 3 in Philippines, 3 in Cuba, 3 in Belgium, and 1 in South
Africa.</p>

0.224418 [note: actually 0.244218] and is NOT statistically significant;
i.e. there is no statistical difference in the number of people
diagnosed with COVID who were vaccinated when compared with the
non-vaccinated group of people."</span> And next he showed this image,
where he made the images on the right himself but he took the table on
the left from a review memorandum for the emergency use authorization of
the Pfizer vaccine:

</div>
<p>There were 8 cases out of 17,411 people in the vaccine group and 162
cases out of 17,511 people in the placebo group, so common sense
should've dictated that the difference between the groups was
statistically significant, and Fleming should've noticed that there was
something wrong with his calculation because he only got a p-value of
about 0.24.</p>
<p>In his contingency matrix the <span class="quote">"observed"</span>
column shows the number of people with no case, or for example
<code>17411-8</code> = 17403 for Pfizer. However I don't understand how
he calculated the <span class="quote">"expected"</span> column. The
numbers in parentheses show the result of
<code>rowSums(m)%*%t(colSums(m))/sum(m)</code> (for example
<code>34652*34752/69503</code> = 17326.25 for the top left square).</p>
<p>However the proper way to make the contingency matrix would've been
to have one column for the number of people with a COVID case and
another column for the number of people with no COVID case. It gave me a
p-value of about 9e-32 here:</p>
<pre>&gt; cases=c(8,162);people=c(17411,17511)

placebo  162   17349

<p>Kevin McCairn also got a similar p-value when he used MATLAB to do a
chi-squared test (but the reason why McCairn said he got a lower p-value
than me was because my p-value was shown as <code>&lt; 2.2e-16</code> by
R even though it was actually about 9e-32 which was similar to McCairn's
result). McCairn wrote:

<p>The figure of 3.21e-11 comes from a paper by Ambati et al. titled
<span class="quote">"MSH3 Homology and Potential Recombination Link to
SARS-CoV-2 Furin Cleavage Site"</span>.
[<a href=https://frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2022.834808/full>https://frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2022.834808/full</a>]
But in the paper 3.21e-11 was not calculated to be the odds of an FCS
occurring naturally but the odds that a given 19-base sequence would be
contained both within a random 30,000-base sequence and within a set of
24,712 random 3,300-base sequences.</p>
<p>The paper by Ambati et al. included the image below with this
caption: <span class="quote">"Calculations of the probability of natural
occurrence of the 19nt sequence under study. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is
~30,000 nucleotides long (P1). The patented sequence is ~3,300
nucleotides long (P2). The patented library encompasses 24'712 sequences
of varying lengths with median length being in the range of 3,300
nucleotides. Conventional probability calculations are given of the
probability of the presence of a 19-nucleotide sequence in the human
genome and in one of the patented library sequences."</span></p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Ambati calculated the likelihood that a given 19-base segment would
be included in SARS-CoV-2, and he multiplied it with the likelihood that
the same segment would be included in the single Moderna patent happened
to match the 19-base segment. But he should've instead just calculated
the likelihood that a given 19-base segment would match the Moderna
patent by chance, like what he did in his <code>P2c</code>
probability.</p>
<p>In order to search the patent BLAST database for sequences that were
published before 2020 and that matched the keyword <span
class="quote">"Moderna"</span>, I used the Entrez query
<code>0[0:2019] Moderna</code>. It returned a total of 669,810 sequences
with a total length of about 1,011,731,339 bases. So if all sequences
are assumed to be random, then the likelihood that any of them would
match a given 19-base segment would be about 0.007:
<code>1-((1-.25^19)^(1e9*2))</code> (where the likelihood of one or more
matches is calculated by subtracting the likelihood of zero matches from
1, and <code>1-.25^19</code> is the likelihood that a single 19-base
segment segment doesn't match the target sequence, and
<code>1e9*2</code> is the approximate number of 19-base segments on both
strands in all Moderna patent sequences). But since there's 8 different
ways to choose a 19-base segment of SARS-CoV-2 that contains the FCS
insert and a total of 7 surrounding bases from either side combined, the
likelihood further increases to <code>1-((1-.25^19)^(1e9*2*8))</code>
which is about 0.06.</p>
<p>For example if you pick two sets of 10 unique random integers between
1 and 1000, then what is the likelihood that both sets include one or
more shared integer? Ambati's logic for calculating the probability of
3.21e-11 was equivalent to calculating the likelihood that a given
integer like 123 would be incluced in both sets, which is
<code>(10/1000)*(10/1000)</code>. But the real likelihood that the two
sets contain one or more shared integers is
<code>1-kcombinations(990,10)/kcombinations(1000,10)</code>, which is
about 0.10 (where <code>kcombinations(990,10)</code> is the number of
ways to choose 10 unique integers which don't match any of the 10 unique
integers in the other set).</p>
<p>Ambati's probability calculation also had other more minor issues
which were mentioned in a response to his paper that was later published
in the same journal:
[<a href=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2022.914888/full>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2022.914888/full</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambati's <code>P2c</code> probability indicated the likelihood that
a given 19-base segment would occur exactly once among the patent
sequences. He should've instead calculated the likelihood that the
19-base segment would occur one or more times among the patent
sequences, which is the same as one minus the likelihood of zero
occurrences: <code>1-((1-.25^19)^((3300-19+1)*24712)</code> (where
<code>1-.25^19</code> is the likelihood that a segment at a given
position of a given patent sequence does not match the 19-base target
sequence, and <code>(3300-19+1)*24712</code> is the number of 19-base
segments on a single strand of all patent sequences). The resulting
probability is about 0.000295014, which is only about 0.01% higher than
Ambati's <code>P2c</code> probability so it doesn't make much difference
though.</li>
<li>Ambati forgot to take into account that the match can occur on
either strand, so he should've multiplied the <code>P2c</code>
probability by 2.</li>
<li>Ambati's probability should've been multiplied 8 because there's 8
different ways to select a 19-base segment that contains the entire
12-base FCS insert and a total of 7 surrounding bases on either side
combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't even know where Ambati et al. got their number of 24,712
sequences in the Moderna patent. Actually the patent contains a total of
33,915 sequences, out of which 4,573 are amino acid sequences and 406
are RNA sequences that contain U bases. The remaining number of
nucleotide sequences is 28,936 which doesn't math Ambati's number of
24,712 sequences. And Ambati's guess that the median length of the
sequences was about 3,300 bases was also wrong because actually the
median length is 1,250.5 bases if you exclude the amino acid and RNA
sequences.</p>
<p>But anyway, Fleming was wrong to say that <span class="quote">"the
odds of such a cleavage site occurring spontaneously (naturally) is 3.21
x 10<sup>-11</sup>"</span>. The likelihood that the FCS would occur
spontaneously is not the same as the likelihood that a specific Moderna
patent would happen to match the specific insert that happened to add
the FCS along with 7 surrounding bases. There are also many other
inserts that could've added an FCS to SARS-CoV-2 and even many
combinations of point mutations that could've added an FCS. The FCS
sequence only needs to have two arginine residues with two other
residues in between, and the sequence can be located at multiple
different spots near the S1/S2 junction.</p>
<p>There's 6 different codons for arginine so there's many different
ways to introduce mutations that produce an arginine residue. For
example in RaTG13 the codons after the spot where Wuhan-Hu-1 has
<code>RRAR</code> are <code>AGT GTA GCT AGT</code> which codes for
<code>SVAS</code>, but it would change to <code>RVAR</code> if the third
nucleotide was changed to <code>A</code> or <code>G</code> and the 12th
nucleotide was changed to <code>A</code> or <code>G</code>.</p>
<p>The codons around the S1/S2 junction in RaTG13 are
<code>T:act N:aat S:tca R:cgt S:agt V:gtg A:gcc</code>, which would match
<code>RXXR</code> if either the <code>T</code> at the start or the
<code>A</code> at the end changed to <code>R</code>. But there's 3
combinations of 2 nucleotide changes and 3 combinations of 3 nucleotide
changes which would change the <code>T</code> at the start to
<code>R</code>, and there's 1 combination of 2 nucleotide changes and 5
combinations of 3 nucleotide changes which would change the
<code>A</code> at the end to <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>The likelihood that the 12-base FCS insert would occur by chance is
not even the same as the likelihood that the 12-base FCS insert and the
7 surrounding bases would occur by chance. And the likelihood that the
specific FCS motif in Wuhan-Hu-1 would occur by chance is not the same
as the likelihood that any FCS motif would occur by chance. And the
likelihood that the FCS insert in Wuhan-Hu-1 would occur naturally is
not the same as the likelihood that it would occur by chance, because
certain mutations might be favored by natural selection. And the
likelihood that the 19-base segment happened to match one specific
Moderna patent is not the same as the likelihood that the 19-base
segment would have occurred naturally.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the likelihood that the 12-base insert and a
total of 7 surrounding bases from either side would have an exact match
in the patent database, you can go here:
<a href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn.><a
href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn"
class="uri">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn</a>.</a>
Set the query sequence to <code>ACTAATTCTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG</code>, which
consists of the 12-base FCS insert, 7 bases before it, and 7 bases after
it. Then switch the database to patent sequences, insert <span
class="quote">"SARS-CoV-2 (taxid:2697049)"</span> as the organism and
click the exclude checkbox next to it, and under algorithm parameters
set maximum results to 1000, and then click <span
class="quote">"BLAST"</span>. When I ran the query, the first 392
matches were mostly matches to SARS-CoV-2 that were not removed by the
species filter, but the matches to the Moderna patent sequences were
listed on rank 393 to 396 (JP 2017197545-A/7090, JP 2017197545-A/7089,
JP 2015518816-A/7090, and JP 2015518816-A/7089). However the E-value of
all matches was about 0.34, which means that about 0.34 similarly close
matches are expected to occur by chance in the patent database:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-modernagate-2.webp width=900>
</div>
<p>The E-value depends on the size of the database, and the patent
database is fairly small compared to other databases like the core
nucleotide database. So when I repeated the previous search but I
switched to the core nucleotide database, there were a bunch of
bacterial sequences that got a perfect match to some 19-base subsegment
of the 26-base query, but their E values were about 8.9 which means that
about 8.9 similarly close matches were expected to occur by chance.</p>
<p>There's 29,885 different 19-base segments of Wuhan-Hu-1, but 1,670 or
about 6% of them had an exact match to the GRCh38 human reference
genome:</p>

<p>Jikky's 19-base segment matches bases 23601 to 23619 of Wuhan-Hu-1,
which codes for the <code>PRRAR</code> codons along with 2 bases before
them and 2 bases after them. The 19-base segment matches the 12-base
insertion in Wuhan-Hu-1 and the next 7 bases. However if we go along
with Jikky's theory where SARS2 acquired the insert in a cell culture
from the human MSH3 gene, it's not clear if the 7-base flanking region
after the insert would've helped to facilitate accidental recombination
much better than a 6-base or 5-base flanking region. And if the last two
bases from Jikky's segment are left out so the flanking region is only 5
bases long, then the 17-base segment has a perfect match on BLAST to all
of these patent sequences published before 2020:</p>

<p>If the amino acid and RNA sequences are excluded, the Moderna patent

19-base segments in Wuhan-Hu-1. So if both collections of segments would

would be <code>.25^19*49159360*29885*2</code> which is about 11.</p>
<p>Jikky wrote this about the 19-base segment: <span class="quote">"In
order for that sequence to have arisen in that virus, the virus which
was manufactured with its HIV inserts, had to have had been infected
into patented cell lines supplied by Moderna that had that unique
sequence not seen in any other virus."</span>
[<a href=https://www.arkmedic.info/p/how-to-blast-your-way-to-the-truth>https://www.arkmedic.info/p/how-to-blast-your-way-to-the-truth</a>]
However it's possible for bioweaponeers to edit the genome as a text
file and then synthesize the whole genome, so they don't have to find a
cell line which contains the 12-base segment they want to insert, then
infect that cell line with the virus a zillion times until the right
piece of the cell line's genome happens to get inserted to the right
spot of the viral genome by chance. In the comments of Jikky's Substack
post, Jennifer Smith who is a PhD virologist also said that <span
class="quote">"the <span class="quote">'accidental'</span> nature you
implied is less likely than purposeful construction"</span>.

<a href=https://x.com/Patent_SUN/status/1901917154578202855.><a

For example he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following five patent publications ① to ⑤ each includes the above
reverse complementary sequence in its Sequence Listing, but no patent
rights have been granted to the reverse complementary sequence
itself.</p>
<p>①US9149506B2<br> ②US9216205B2<br> ③US9255129B2<br> ④US9301993B2<br>
⑤US9587003B2</p>
<p>Therefore, we must carefully explain the reverse complementary
sequence so as not to mislead the public. Regarding those patent
publications ① to ⑤, by referring to the <span class="quote">"We
claim"</span> section (scope of Claims) attached to the end of each
specification, we can understand where the patent rights exist.</p>
<p>As we can see in each <span class="quote">"We claim"</span> section
of the patent publications ① to ⑤, there is no description of <span
class="quote">"CTACGTGCCCGCCGAGGAG."</span></p>
<p>From this fact, we can understand that the patent rights have NOT
been granted to it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The topic has strayed off course, but realistically, it is not
possible for Moderna to obtain a patent for this specific sequence,
<span class="quote">"CTACGTGCCCGCCGAGGAG,"</span> or just a part of it
(i.e., the furin cleavage site). This is because Moderna disclosed <span
class="quote">"SEQ ID 11652"</span> as a complete sequence, which
includes that specific sequence, but did not disclose the segment as an
independent invention. This fails to meet the support requirement for
patentability, and it is unlikely that a patent will be granted for this
specific sequence in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if Moderna were to attempt to obtain a patent right
for <span class="quote">"SEQ ID 11652,"</span> I believe it would be a
difficult process. Realistically, if Moderna were to pursue a patent
right for <span class="quote">"SEQ ID 11652,"</span> the specification
would need to explicitly describe the usage, function, and effects of
<span class="quote">"SEQ ID 11652"</span> in order to meet the
aforementioned support requirement. However, none of the specifications
in the Patents 1 to 5 mention <span class="quote">"SEQ ID 11652,"</span>
nor is there any disclosure suggesting it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Moderna does not address the complementary sequence of
<span class="quote">"CTACGTGCCCGCCGAGGAG,"</span> which is <span
class="quote">"CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG,"</span> anywhere in the
specification. Therefore, the patent rights of the Patents 1 to 5 never
extend to the <span class="quote">'CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG'</span> sequence
of the COVID-19 virus.</p>

<p>Another addendum: I went to nucleotide BLAST:

I entered the accession of SARS-CoV-2 to the text field at the top
(NC_045512), and I changed the database to patent sequences. I set the
Entrez query to <code>0:2019[dp] Moderna</code> to return patent
sequences that were published at GenBank before 2020 and that matched
the word Moderna in any of the fields. Then under algorithm parameters I
reduced the word size to 16, I increased the expect threshold to 1000,
and I increased maximum target sequences to 1000.</p>
<p>There were a total of 495 results. The best matches with 100%
identity were 23 bases long, but even they had an expect value of about
2.3, which means that about 2.3 similarly close matches were expected to
occur by chance:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/modernagate-blast.webp width=900>
</div>
<p>The expect values of the perfect 19-base matches were about 381,
which means that about 381 similarly close matches were expected to
occur by chance within the set of patent sequences that were published
before 2020 and that matched the word <span
class="quote">"Moderna"</span>.</p>
<p>Then I clicked <span class="quote">"Download"</span> and selected
<span class="quote">"Hit Table (text)"</span>. It showed that there were
176 perfect matches with a length of 19 bases, 55 with length 20, 6 with
length 21, 13 with length 22, and 6 with length 23:</p>

19 176
20 55
21 6
22 13
23 6</pre>
<p>There weren't even that many duplicate matches among the perfect
matches that were at least 19 bases long, because the matches started at
92 unique positions of the genome of SARS-CoV-2. There were also 256
unique patent sequences which had a perfect match at least 19 bases
long:</p>

256</pre>
<p>The perfect matches that were at least 19 bases long covered 1,532
bases of the genome of SARS-CoV-2, which is about 5% of the total length
of the genome:</p>
<pre>$ awk &#39;$3==100&amp;&amp;$4&gt;=19{for(i=$7;i&lt;=$8;i++)a[i]}END{print length(a)}&#39; Downloads/XRN2HBFD016-Alignment.txt
1532</pre>
<p>When I clicked <span class="quote">"Search Summary"</span>, it showed
that there were a total of about 700,000 sequences in the patent
database that matched the Entrez query <code>0:2019[dp] Moderna</code>,
and their total length was about a billion bases:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/modernagate-blast-2.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>The total length of all sequences in the patent database in March
2025 was about 28.3 billion bases. So about 4% of the total length was
made up by sequences that were published before 2020 and that matched
the keyword <span class="quote">"Moderna"</span>.</p>
<p>This plot shows all matches with the same or lower expect value as
the match to Jikky's 19-base segment:</p>

<a href=#Alex_Washburnes_endonuclease_fingerprint_paper id=Alex_Washburnes_endonuclease_fingerprint_paper>Alex
Washburne's endonuclease fingerprint paper</a>
</h3>
<p>Fleming's affidavit referred to Alex Washburne's paper titled <span
class="quote">"Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of
SARS-CoV-2"</span>.</p>
<p>The paper said: <span class="quote">"Fisher's exact test was used to
assess if there was a higher rate of silent mutations within BsaI/BsmBI
recognition sites compared to the rest of the viral genome. Odds ratios
were computed as the ratio of silent mutations to all other nucleotides
within BsaI/BsmBI sites of either genome in a pairwise alignment
compared to the ratio of silent mutations outside BsaI/BsmBI sites to
all other nucleotides. There are 12 silent mutations found in 9 distinct
BsaI/BsmBI sites between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, and 882 silent mutations
outside of BsaI/BsmBI sites."</span>
[<a href=https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr560730>https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr560730</a>]</p>
<p>The BsaI recognition sequence is <code>GGTCTC</code> and the BsmBI
recognition sequence is <code>CGTCTC</code>, so both of them are 6 bases
long. So the total length of the 9 recognition sites is <code>9*6</code>
which is 54 bases.</p>
<p>So the Fisher's test can be calculated like this:</p>
<pre>recognition_silent=12
recognition_total=54
other_silent=882
genome_length=29903

m=c(recognition_silent,recognition_total-recognition_silent)
m=c(m,other_silent,genome_length-other_silent-recognition_total)
fisher.test(matrix(m,2))$p
# 5.120702e-08</pre>
<p>However Guy Gadboit showed here why Washburne's logic of calculating
the p-values and odds ratios was wrong:
<a href=https://x.com/gadboit/status/1833191562961887679.><a

class="uri">https://x.com/gadboit/status/1833191562961887679</a>.</a>
After Gadboit corrected the calculation, he got the odds ratios to be
centered around 1 and not around 2 like in Washburne's code. See also
these threads:

<p>There's 5 BsaI/BsmBI recognition sites in Wuhan-Hu-1 and 6 in RaTG13,
but 2 of them are included in both so there's 9 distinct sites:</p>

<p>People often say that the BsmBI and BsaI sites are ideally spaced for
a genetically engineered virus. But the output above shows that the two
sites that are shared by both RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 start at positions
17326 and 17969 in RaTG13. So why would two such nearby sites be kept?
But on the other hand the site 24494 would have been removed and 24102
would have been inserted in its place. And 10441 would be removed but
9751 would be inserted in its place.</p>
<p>In the scenario where a restriction map was built for Wuhan-Hu-1
using RaTG13 as a starting point, the engineers of the virus might have
introduced silent mutations to eliminate unwanted recognition sites and
to introduce wanted recognition sites, which is why Washburne counted
the number of recognition sites in both the source and target sequence.
His paper said: <span class="quote">"In 2013, researchers constructed a
recombinant MERS coronavirus (Scobey et al. 2013). The wildtype virus
had a few BglI sites at inconvenient locations, making it poorly
amenable to efficient assembly. To construct an idealized MERS-CoV
reverse genetic system for IVGA, the researchers removed the existing
BglI sites and inserted 6 more evenly spaced BglI sites. All
additions/removals were done via synonymous mutations, creating 7
fragments, the longest of which was 5721bp, or 19% the length of the
30kb MERS genome (Fig 2A)."</span></p>
<p>I don't know why the engineers would need to use both BsaI and BsmBI
and not just one of them, like in the case of the reverse genetics
system for MERS where only BglI was used. The draft version of the
DEFUSE proposal mentioned an order for BsmBI (R0580S and R0580L) but not
BsaI:

<div>
<img src=i/fleming-defuse-bsai.jpg width=500>

<p>If only BsmBI was used, it would produce only 4 fragments where the
longest fragment would be about 12,000 bases long:</p>

<p>Washburne's paper says that <span class="quote">"the BsaI sites in
SARS-COV-2 flank the S1 gene and S1/S2 junction, and a similar design
has been used before for substitutions in this region"</span>. However
one BsaI site is about 500 away from the S1/S2 junction and the other

<p>Corman-Drosten's RdRp primer set was designed to match both
SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV. It has two
different probes, where the P2 probe is designed to be specific to
SARS-CoV-2 but the P1 probe is a so-called <span
class="quote">"pan-sarbecovirus"</span> probe that is also designed to
match other SARS-like viruses. So it's no surprise that the RdRp primers
actually match the MA15 strain of SARS1 and SHC014 and Rs3367 which are
SARS1-like bat viruses, because that's what they were designed to
do.</p>
<p>The paper about the Corman-Drosten protocol includes the figure below
which shows that their primers match various SARS-like viruses like
ZC45, SARS1, and BM48-31 (even though the E gene primers and probe each
have a single mismatch to BM48-31, and the N gene primers and probe have
even more mismatches to BM48-31, so the N gene primers and probe might
have too many mismatches to yield a positive result for BM48-31):

<p>I also don't understand why Fleming claims that MA15 is a <span

combination of two or more viruses. The paper about MA15 said: <span

There's a large number of different MA15 sequences at GenBank, but
Fleming's screenshot showed the MA15 isolate d30m5, which has only 23
nucleotide changes from the SARS-CoV Urbani sequence at GenBank:</p>

suspicious, and it's also strange how Rs3367 is otherwise nearly
identical to WIV1 but Rs3367 is missing ORFx but WIV1 is not). Fleming
may have confused SHC014 with the chimeric virus described in Menachery
et al. 2015, where the spike protein of SHC014 was inserted to an MA15
backbone. In another version of his graphic I showed above he has in
fact inserted the SHC014-MA15 chimera in place of the regular SHC014.
However even in the SHC014-MA15 chimera the RdRp comes from SARS1, so
it's not unusual that the RdRp would match Corman-Drosten's primers
which were designed to match SARS1.</p>
<p>SHC014 and Rs3367 both have about 95-96% nucleotide identity to
SARS1. And in both of them the region of the RdRp that was shown in
Fleming's image is 100% identical to the Tor2 reference genome of
SARS1:</p>

I believe he suggested that SHC014 was the same virus as SARS-CoV
Urbani. He may have been confused by how at GenBank Baric's MA15-SHC014
chimera is called <span
class="quote">"SARS-Urbani-MA_SHC014-spike"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT308984.1>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT308984.1</a>]
But MA15 is a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV which is derived from the
Urbani strain, and in Baric's chimera the spike protein of the
SARS1-like bat virus SHC014 was inserted to MA15.</p>
<p>I also don't understand what evidence Fleming has that specifically
Rs3367 was <span class="quote">"built by Baric and Zhengli"</span> like
he wrote. It's one of about 50 published SARS1-like bat viruses that
have around 5-6% nucleotide distance to SARS1. I do consider some of the
SARS1-like bat viruses to have a laboratory origin, and it's suspicious
how Rs3367 is otherwise nearly identical to WIV1 except Rs3367 is
missing ORFx but WIV1 is not, and there are similarly other branches of
SARS1-like viruses where ORFx is included in some members of the branch
but not others, which is reminiscent of how an ACE2-binding RBM seems to
have mysteriously emerged in some closely related SARS1-like viruses but
not others.

<p>However if other sarbecoviruses would've been in widespread
circulation then they would've been detected by metagenomic sequencing,
where all genetic material in a sample is sequenced without having to
rely on primers to amplify any targeted organism:

The NCBI provides cloud services that make it possible to search the
Sequence Read Archive for sequencing runs with reads that have a k-mer
hit for a specific virus like SARS-CoV. A lot of people including me
have searched through sequencing runs trying to look for unusual
SARS-like viruses, and I have downloaded thousands of SRA runs with
k-mer hits for sarbecoviruse and I have aligned the reads of the runs
against SARS-like viruses, but I haven't found evidence that any other
sarbecovirus besides SARS-CoV-2 would've circulated in humans since
2020. In 2021 Chinese researchers found French influenza sequencing runs
from 2007-2012 that were contaminated with the lab-created ExoN1 and
wtic strains of SARS1 (so the runs were probably either contaminated in
a laboratory or there was an outbreak of SARS1 in France due a
laboratory leak).

But if SARS1-like viruses would've been in any kind of widespread
circulation since 2020, then people would've found reads of SARS1 at the
SRA by using similar methodology that the Chinese researchers used to
find the French influenza A samples that were contaminated with SARS1.
And in general a huge amount of resources was directed to researching
sarbecoviruses during COVID, so if other sarbecoviruses woudl've been in
any kind of widespread circulation in humans, they would have certainly
been detected.</p>
<p>Fleming also posted a tweet that said: <span class="quote">"People

But I don't know how he was confident enough that specifically Rs3367,
SHC014, and MA15 were circulating in humans that he was willing to state
it as a fact that people died because of those specific viruses. Apart
from SHC014 and Rs3367, there are approximately 50 other SARS1-like
viruses published at GenBank that have around 95% identity to SARS1, so
how did Fleming know it wasn't one of them circulating in humans
instead?</p>

<p>However viruses obviously don't have chromosomes (even though the

[<a href=https://www.flemingmethod.com/gain-of-function>https://www.flemingmethod.com/gain-of-function</a>,
part 2 of presentation in Tampa, time 11:09] However in the paper by Wu
et al. which described the first published genome of SARS-CoV-2, the
authors did metagenomic sequencing where they sequenced all genetic
material in a sample of bronchoalveolar fluid but they didn't remove
human or bacterial genetic material. In their STAT results only about
0.2% of their reads are identified as viral.

About half of their reads consist of only <code>N</code> bases because
human reads were masked with <code>N</code> bases for privacy reasons.
Supplementary Table 1 of the paper shows that 49 out of 50 of the most
abundant MEGAHIT contigs consisted of fragments of the genomes of
bacteria.

<p>Next Fleming said: <span class="quote">"Now frequently it's broken
into pieces and you have to put it together like a puzzle. But you can
do that just like a puzzle, and that's called Sanger sequencing."</span>
But the procedure of assembling the reads like a puzzle is not called
Sanger sequencing but it's called genome assembly. Wu et al. used
next-generation sequencing and not Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing
is used only rarely to sequence SARS-CoV-2. The NCBI's Sequence Read
Archive has raw reads of about 7 million sequencing runs where the
organism is listed as SARS-CoV-2, but I haven't found a single SRA run
where Sanger sequencing was used to sequence the entire genome, but I
have only found runs where fragments of the virus like a part of the
spike protein were sequenced with Sanger sequencing, and Sanger
sequencing is sometimes also used to sequence amplicons produced by PCR
tests.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=sars-cov-2+%22sanger+sequencing%22>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=sars-cov-2+%22sanger+sequencing%22</a>]</p>
<p>Next Fleming described PCR testing like this: <span
class="quote">"And so the spike protein was chosen. And you already saw
that we know where the spike protein is in this sequence. And so you
look for the beginning of it, and you find about 12 to 18 pieces - amino
acids - rather nucleotide bases - that start the spike protein, and
that's called the forward primer. And you look for the end of it and you
say, well, where's the end? And you look for a roughly 15 to 18 of
those, and that's called a reverse primer, which reads the opposite
direction."</span> But the spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 is 3,822 bases
long if you include the stop codon, but typically in PCR tests for
SARS-CoV-2 the distance between the forward and reverse primers is only
about 100 to 200 bases. The forward and reverse primers don't have to be
located at opposite ends of the same gene or even within the same gene.
Also PCR primers are almost always longer than 12 bases. In PCR tests
for SARS-CoV-2, the length of the primers ranges from about 18 to 26
bases.</p>

part suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not naturally occurring but

manmade, going as far back as 2006, then doesn't this add credence to

<p>However in the paper he referred to, the authors used <span

they inserted into a 1,200-base chimeric RNA sequence. The paper said:
<span class="quote">"Because most commercial armored RNA preparations

species are often prepared for calibration of each target in multiple
virus assays. To reduce costs and simplify multivirus detection, we are
seeking to produce a single chimeric armored RNA species that might be
used as a positive control for multiple viral targets. We consider this
task to be feasible because the inventors of armored RNA predicted that,
theoretically, at least 2 kb of nonbacteriophage RNA sequence might be
encapsulated. As proof of this principle, we tried to directly package a
1200-nucleotide-long foreign RNA sequence containing gene fragments of
hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome

<p>In 2010, Shi Zhengli conducted chimeric research on SARS-CoV-1 (then
called SARS-CoV), including combining HIV-pseudovirus to look at the
binding capacity of this virus with human ACE2 receptors. Their work
specifically included altering (through mutagenesis) the spike proteins
to determine how to increase the spike protein binding to the ACE2
receptor.</p>
<p>The research showed no proline-arginine-arginine-alanine (PRRA)
insert critical to the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors on
human cells. As noted in this published research (jointly done by
Dr. Zhengli at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, researchers in
Australia, and the University of Minnesota Medical School), not only is
the spike protein from horseshoe bats unable to bind to ACE2 receptors,
but also these differences along with differences in civets highlight a
critical missing piece to the zoonotic theory of the original of
SARS-CoV-2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, although the genetically related SARS-like coronavirus
(SL-CoV) has been identified in horseshoe bats of the genus Rhinolophus
[5, 8, 12, 18], <strong>its spike protein was not able to use the human
ACE2 (hACE2) protein as a receptor</strong>. Close examination of the
crystal structure of human SARS-CoV RBD complexed with hACE2 suggests
that truncations in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of SL-CoV
spike protein abolish its hACE2-binding ability [7, 10], and hence the
SL-CoV found recently in horseshoe bats is unlikely to be the direct
ancestor of human SARS-CoV.</p>
<p>Also, it has been shown that <strong>the human SARS-CoV spike protein
and its closely related civet SARS-CoV spike protein were not able to
use a horseshoe bat</strong> (<em>R. pearsoni</em>) ACE2 as a receptor
[13], <strong>highlighting a critical missing link in the
bat-tocivet/human transmission</strong> chain of SARSCoV. [Emphasis
added [by Fleming].]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However the paper he quoted said that other studies had found that
various SARS-like bat viruses were not able to use human ACE2 as a
receptor, and next it said that SARS-CoV was not able to use bat ACE2 as
a receptor. But the paper he quoted did not say anywhere that SARS-CoV
was not able to use human ACE2 as a receptor.

<p>ACE2 binding ability is not even determined by the FCS insert like
Fleming suggested but by the RBD, because cleavage by furin occurs at a
later step after the virus has already bound to the ACE2 receptor.
ChatGPT said that the procedure of viral entry to a human cell consists
of these steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Spike protein on virus</strong> binds to the <strong>ACE2
receptor</strong> on human cells via the S1 subunit.</li>
<li><strong>Conformational change</strong> occurs in the spike protein
after ACE2 binding.</li>
<li><strong>Furin cleavage</strong> of the spike protein between the S1
and S2 subunits primes the virus for entry.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary cleavage</strong> by <strong>TMPRSS2</strong> or
<strong>cathepsins</strong> activates the spike protein, exposing the
fusion peptide.</li>
<li><strong>Membrane fusion</strong> is mediated by the S2 subunit,
allowing viral RNA to enter the host cell.</li>
<li><strong>Viral RNA release</strong> into the host cell cytoplasm
initiates infection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Taken together, these statements from research paid for by NIAID

Gain-of-Function research - appear to confirm both Dr. Li-Meng Yan's
assertion that SARS-CoV-1 was the first bioweapon and that SARS-CoV-2 is
the advanced version noting the PRRA segment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Fleming didn't mention that by <span class="quote">"the bat
coronavirus"</span> the authors he quoted referred to RaTG13.)</p>
<p>I don't understand how Fleming concluded based on the paper he quoted
that <span class="quote">"SARS-CoV-1 was the first bioweapon"</span>. If
motifs similar to Pradhan's inserts are missing from SARS-CoV but
present in RaTG13, MERS, or HKU1, then how does that show that SARS-CoV
was artificially engineered? Was SARS-CoV engineered to remove Pradhan's
inserts?</p>
<p>I wrote about Pradhan et al. here:
<a href=pradhan.html>pradhan.html</a>. Pradhan identified the locations
of the so-called inserts by doing a pairwise alignment of SARS-CoV-2
against SARS-CoV, so you couldn't tell if the gaps in Pradhan's pairwise
alignment were insertions in SARS-CoV-2 or deletions in SARS-CoV.
Pradhan's first so-called insert actually looks more like a deletion in
SARS-CoV. When I used a more accurate method to determine the positions
of the gaps by doing a multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 against
a diverse set of sarbecoviruses, the gaps near the second and third
so-called inserts were placed at different spots than in Pradhan's
paper, so it looked like Pradhan's second and third inserts were not
inserts at all, but the real second insert was after the motif
identified by Pradhan and the real third insert was before the motif
identified by Pradhan.</p>
<p>For example in Pradhan's pairwise alignment it looked like SARS-CoV-2
had the insert <code>YYHK</code> relative to SARS-CoV:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-pradhan-insert2.webp width=300>
</div>
<p>But the next image shows that two residues after the
<code>YYHK</code>, SARS-CoV-2 has the motif <code>KSW</code> which is
shared by European and African sarbecoviruses, but after the
<code>KSW</code> SARS-CoV-2 has the insert <code>MESEFR</code> that is
missing from the European and African viruses. So the real insert rather
seems like <code>MESEFR</code> and not <code>YYHK</code> (but before
<code>YYHK</code> SARS-CoV also seems to have an insertion of the
residues <code>SK</code>):</p>

<p>18 RNA fragments of homology equal or more than 80% with human or

are concentrated in a small part of the genome.</p>

<p>This is shown schematically in the figure found on page XXX in the

<p>Fleming misunderstood what Perez meant by the 1,770-base region of
the spike protein. It wasn't an HIV-like insertion in SARS-CoV-2 that
was missing from other sarbecoviruses, but it was a region where
SARS-CoV-2 had high similarity to RaTG13:
[<a href=https://www.granthaalayahpublication.org/journals/granthaalayah/article/view/IJRG20_B07_3568>https://www.granthaalayahpublication.org/journals/granthaalayah/article/view/IJRG20_B07_3568</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-perez.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>Pezez's 1,770-base region started after the FCS insert and it
extended to the end of the spike protein, so it was identical to the S2
subunit of the spike protein. Perez seems to have calculated the length
of the region of the wrong, because it should actually be 1,767 or 1,764
nucleotides depending on whether you include the stop codon or not.
Perez made many similar errors in his paper where he got the length or
coordinates of sequences wrong. But anyway, the black rectangle here
shows that there's only 3 amino acid changes in the S2 region, because
there's only 3 steps up in the line for nonsynonymous mutations:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-perez-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>In one of his presentations Fleming said: <span class="quote">"Luc
Montagnier - who was a friend of mine - passed away on the 8th of
February, he and Jean-Claude Perez did this work to show the HIV and SIV
inserts that they found. PRRA, four proteins, each one has three
nucleotide bases. That's 12 nucleotide bases. They found
1,770-nucleotide-base inserts. That's not naturally occurring. They
occur one nucleotide base at a time."</span>
[<a href=https://www.flemingmethod.com/gain-of-function>https://www.flemingmethod.com/gain-of-function</a>,
video from Phoenix, time 43:48] But again Perez's 1,770-base region is
not any kind of an insert, but it consists of the entire S2 subunit of
the spike protein (plus 3 or 6 extra bases that were likely the due to
an error Perez made in calculating the length of the S2 subunit).</p>
<p>I have shown here why Perez's paper is complete junk:

He used nucleotide BLAST instead of protein BLAST like Pradhan, but he
forgot to exclude matches that were on the wrong strand or wrong frame,
which caused most of his matches to be meaningless because they don't
code for the same amino acids in HIV and SARS-CoV-2. His Table 1

<p>Perez identified two regions in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 where he
found an unusually high density of BLAST matches to HIV/SIV, which he
called regions A and B. However he identified the regions based on the
web GUI for BLAST, which had a lot of duplicate results for matches to
the same region of SARS-CoV-2 from similar subtypes of HIV. In order to
get a more diverse representation of different subtypes of HIV, I tried
to instead do a BLAST search of SARS-CoV-2 against sequences from the
LANL HIV subtype reference, which consists of 555 sequences from various
subtypes of HIV along with a few HIV-1-like sequences of SIV.</p>
<p>In the next plot you can ignore the top panel which shows matches to
both strands, and focus on the bottom panel that shows only the plus

<p>By 2023 she had become a member of a neo-Theosophical cult called
ALLATRA, even though I don't know if it's related to her criminal
charges.

In 2023 Peková presented genetic evidence that Slavs are the oldest
ethnic group after the fall of Atlantis.

In a video in 2024, Soňa Peková talked about the Pleiadians and how
contact with aliens is a win-win situation, and she also said that Gaia
has the capacity to reach up to 9D reality and not only 5D, even though
it's possible that vaccinated people cannot move to a higher dimension.
[<a href=https://www.podtatransky-kurier.sk/galaxia/sona-pekova-gaia-ma-byt-az-9d>https://www.podtatransky-kurier.sk/galaxia/sona-pekova-gaia-ma-byt-az-9d</a>]</p>
<p>ALLATRA says that the world will end in the year 2036, they promote
theories about ancient aliens and 5D ascension, and they say that
reality is contaminated by Draconian reptilians who have a goal of
enslaving humanity.

A member of ALLATRA called Zhanna is allegedly an Anunnaki who makes
TikTok videos from a space station. The primary book of ALLATRA is
presented as a dialogue between the author of the book and the ascended
master Rigden Djappo, who is a mythical character invented by the
Russian Theosophist Nikolas Roerich.
[<a href=https://handwiki.org/wiki/Organization:AllatRa>https://handwiki.org/wiki/Organization:AllatRa</a>]</p>
<p>ALLATRA is overtly based in Ukraine, but they run a multilingual
media operation that produces conspiracy content in various languages,
and much of their content is initially released in English but then
translated to various Slavic languages. It is reminiscent of the
multilingual empires operated by the Unification Church, Falun Gong, and
Miles Guo's cult. All of them are based in New York even though they
primarily target East Asian countries, and the leaders of all three
cults moved from an East Asian country to New York to run the cult. But
ALLATRA seems very much like a version of Falun Gong that was created
for the Eastern European demographic instead of China.</p>
<p>ALLATRA's international representative is Egon Cholakian, who claims
that he is an intelligence expert who studied under Henry Kissinger, and
that he had a close working relationship with the head of the CIA while
he resided in Iran, and that he was a founding member of the OSINT
Foundation.
[<a href=https://earthsavesciencecollaborative.com>https://earthsavesciencecollaborative.com</a>]
However his bio seems to be mostly fake and I didn't find it
corroborated by outside sources.</p>
<p>Egon Cholakian's website used to have an AI-generated photo where he
posed together with the Nobel laureate Robert Merton, but if you zoomed
in on the background, there were photos on display where people were
missing faces, and the backs of books on a bookshelf didn't have any
legible text.

<p>ALLATRA has a YouTube channel that consists of AI-generated videos
that employ the avatar of Egon Cholakian:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-allatrayoutube.webp width=863>
</div>
<p>In one of the videos Egon Cholakian said that <span
class="quote">"The claim by Russian media that I am a deep fake is so
absurd it would be laughable if it weren't part of a larger coordinated
effort to mislead you."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EM0Dp2Cmg&start=1m46s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EM0Dp2Cmg&amp;start=1m46s</a>]
In another video he called himself a <span class="quote">"specialist in
intelligence and disinformation"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2GVN5Hj16Y&t=18m30s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2GVN5Hj16Y&amp;t=18m30s</a>]
In the same video he also said that Scientology was an <span
class="quote">"international pro-democratic organization"</span>, and
that Scientology was unjustly persecuted in Russia. [time 1:32:47]</p>
<p>ALLATRA claims that they are not a cult, but they made an 8-hour
documentary about how the anti-cult movement is the root of all the
world's evils, and how the anti-cult movement is the power behind
Putin's throne, and the anti-cult movement did 9/11, and the anti-cult
movement is secretly orchestrating school shootings.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l4CAqW1B2g&t=21060s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l4CAqW1B2g&amp;t=21060s</a>]
The film also included a long segment about how Falun Gong was
persecuted in China.</p>
<p>The secular arm of ALLATRA is known as the Creative Society, which
ALLATRA aims to one day make into the governing body of the world. Their
emblem looks similar to the emblem of the Theosophical Society, except
the head of the snake has been replaced with an arrowhead, the star of
David has been replaced with a triangle, the ankh has been replaced with
a Moebius strip, and the swastika has been removed:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-creative-theosophical.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>The Creative Society has developed a <span
class="quote">"comprehensive mathematical and tectonophysical model of
contemporary changes occurring on earth"</span>.
[<a href=https://creativesociety.com/climate-model>https://creativesociety.com/climate-model</a>]
The term <span class="quote">"earth changes"</span> was coined by the
Theosophical guru Edgar Cacey.</p>
<p>In the same way Scientology is allied with the Nation of Islam,
ALLATRA is allied with an African American freemasonic lodge called the
World's Masonic United Nations. The Facebook page of Creative Society
featured a speech by the Most Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander of the
World's Masonic United Nations, who said that the world's strongest
foundation is the Eight Pillars of Creative Society, and he said that
<span class="quote">"we support the Creative Society project and we will
use all legal and peaceful means to implement this ideal as broadly and
quickly as possible"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=264451399321129>https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=264451399321129</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/fleming-worldmasonic.webp width=1185>
</div>
<p>In a Czech-language Facebook post, Soňa Peková wrote that humans have
to find peace within themselves, <span class="quote">"So that we can
start building a new society as quickly as possible, based on the
principles of humanity, solidarity, generosity, equality and
belonging."</span>
[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=122184364922255070&id=61557652117076>https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=122184364922255070&amp;id=61557652117076</a>]
She used the same Czech word for <span class="quote">"society"</span>
that is used in the Czech name for Creative Society. So by building a
new society, she might have referred to the Creative Society, which is
the organization that ALLATRA aims to establish as the governing body of
the world, so that one day the world will be ruled by ALLATRA.
[<a href=https://creativesociety.com/about-the-project>https://creativesociety.com/about-the-project</a>]</p>
<p>Similar to Scientology and NOI, ALLATRA is also concerned with the
topic of autism, except ALLATRA says that autism is caused by
microplastics and not by vaccines.

by Slovak Academy of Sciences</a>
</h3>
<p>The Slovak Academy of Sciences published the following statement
about the paper by Richard Fleming, Peter Kotlár, and Soňa Peková:
[<a href=https://www.sav.sk/?lang=sk&doc=services-news&source_no=20&news_no=12787>https://www.sav.sk/?lang=sk&amp;doc=services-news&amp;source_no=20&amp;news_no=12787</a>,

<blockquote>
<p>The Slovak Academy of Sciences is responding to a publication
published in the HSOA Journal of Angiology and Vascular Surgery,
co-authored by the Slovak Government's Plenipotentiary for Review of the
Resource Governance and Management Process during the COVID-19 pandemic,
Peter Kotlár.</p>
<p>The Slovak Academy of Sciences is following with interest the
attempts to re-analyze vaccines that have been analyzed many times.
However, the published publication does not adequately describe the
methods, lacks controls, and does not clearly define the input
quantities of material. The published claims are not confronted with
existing knowledge or other methods, which is necessary given the
seriousness of the findings presented.</p>
<p>The title of the publication suggests a quantitative analysis, but
the results are not compared to the prescribed and strictly controlled
quantitative limits of residual DNA, and estimated numbers of molecules
are given, which can be misleading. Strong conclusions are not supported
by sufficiently strong data.</p>
<p>The scientific shortcomings of the aforementioned publication reflect
the fact that the journal in which it was published is classified as a
predatory journal. This particular journal does not meet even basic
quality criteria, is not registered in recognized databases, has a very
short review process and unclear review procedure, and does not have
defined basic rules for presenting results and methodologies.</p>
<p>The Slovak Academy of Sciences strictly condemns publishing in
predatory journals and warns that publications published in this way do
not bring value and are of no importance to the scientific community,
medical practice, or the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper by Fleming, Kotlár, and Pekova was published in a journal
of the predatory publisher Herald Scholarly Open Access.
[<a href=https://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/quantitative-analysis-of-nucleic-acid-content-in-spikevax-moderna-and-bnt162b2-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-lots>https://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/quantitative-analysis-of-nucleic-acid-content-in-spikevax-moderna-and-bnt162b2-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-lots</a>]
One of Herald's journals published a paper by Hellsing et al. about the
benefit of garlic in fighting vampires. The authors wrote that the
purpose of their paper was <span class="quote">"improving the stature of
vampire hunting among the scientifically literate populace, and testing
whether or not AIMS journals are predatory"</span>.
