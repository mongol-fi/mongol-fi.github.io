<h2>
<a href=#Short_version id=Short_version>Short version</a>
</h2>
<p>This HTML file addresses misconceptions about the reference genome of
SARS-CoV-2 that have emerged among people who claim that viruses do not
exist.</p>
<p>In the paper by Wu et al. where the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome was
described, the authors wrote that when they did metagenomic sequencing
for a sample of lung fluid from a COVID patient, they got a total of
384,096 contigs when they did de-novo assembly for the reads using
MEGAHIT, and they used the longest contig as the initial reference
genome of SARS2. Some no-virus people thought it meant that the other
contigs were alternative candidates for the genome of SARS2, but
actually the other contigs mostly consisted of fragments of the human
genome or bacterial genomes. In Supplementary Table 2 which shows the
best match on BLAST for the 50 most abundant contigs, the best match is
bacterial for all other contigs except the contig for SARS2.</p>
<p>Wu et al.'s longest MEGAHIT contig happened to be the contig for
SARS2 by chance, because there were no bacterial contigs longer than
30,000 bases even though one bacterial contig listed in Supplementary
Table 1 was longer than 10,000 bases. When I ran MEGAHIT for Wu et al.'s
raw reads, my second-longest contig was a 16,036-base contig for
<em>Leptotrichia hongkongensis</em> and my third-longest contig was a
13,656-base contig for <em>Veillonella parvula</em>. However in other
cases MEGAHIT will of course produce longer contigs for bacteria, and
for example when I used MEGAHIT to assemble metagenomic reads of the bat
sarbecovirus RmYN02, my longest contig was a contig for <em>E. coli</em>
which was about 50,000 bases long, and the contig for RmYN02 was only
the 4th-longest contig.</p>
<p>When I ran MEGAHIT Wu et al.'s raw reads, I got a total of about
30,000 contigs, but when I aligned my contigs against a set of about
15,000 virus reference sequences, I got only 8 contigs which matched
viruses. I got only one contig which matched SARS2. And I got 4 contigs
which matched the human endogenous retrovirus K113, but the contigs
probably just came from the human genome since the sequences of HERVs
are incorporated into the human genome. And I got one short contig which
matched a <em>Streptococcus</em> phage and two short contigs which
matched a parvovirus, both of which also had a handful of reads in the
STAT results so they probably represent genuine matches to viruses. So
among approximately 30,000 contigs, there may have been only 4 contigs
which came from viruses. The reason why my number of contigs was an
order of magnitude lower than the number reported by Wu et al. is
probably because almost all human reads were masked with N bases in the
reads uploaded to SRA, so my contigs included only a small number of
contigs for fragments of the human genome.</p>
<p>About half of Wu et al.'s reads consist of only N bases, but it's
probably human reads were masked because of NCBI's privacy policy. The
NCBI has even published a command-line utility called Human Scrubber,
which is used to replace human reads with N bases in raw reads that are
submitted to the Sequence Read Archive. Wu et al. wrote that about 24
million reads out of about 57 million reads remained after they filtered
out human reads, which roughly matches the reads at the SRA where
there's about 27 million reads that consist of only N bases out of a
total of about 57 million reads.</p>
<p>The first version of Wuhan-Hu-1 submitted to GenBank was 30,474 bases
long but the current version is only 29,903 bases long. That's because
the first version accidentally included a 618-base segment of human DNA
at the 3' end, where the first 20 bases of the segment are part of both
the actual genome of SARS2 and the human genome. The error was soon
fixed in the second version of Wuhan-Hu-1 which was published at GenBank
two days after the first version, and the error was even mentioned by
Eddie Holmes on Twitter. I have found similar assembly errors in other
sarbecovirus sequences, like RfGB02, Sin3408, Rs7907, Rs7931, GX-P1E,
and Ra7909. So the reason why the original 30,474-base contig cannot be
reproduced from the reads at the SRA is because almost all human reads
were masked with N bases at SRA.</p>
<p>When the anonymous mathematician from Hamburg used BBMap to align Wu
et al.'s raw reads against the reference genomes of SARS2 and other
viruses, he got a large number of reads to align against the reference
genomes of HIV-1, measles, and hepatitis delta, but that's because he
ran BBMap with the parameter <code>minratio=0.1</code> which used
extremely loose alignment criteria. Among the reads which aligned
against HIV-1, the average error rate was about 40% and the most common
read length 37 bases, but almost all of the reads would've remained
unaligned if he would've ran BBMap with the default parameters which
tolerate a much lower number of errors. The error rate was not mentioned
in his paper but I was able to calculate it by running his code myself.
However for the reads which aligned against SARS2, the most common
length was 151 bases and the average error rate of the 151-base reads
was only about 2%.</p>
<p>In the paper by the mathematician from Hamburg, there's plots for
each virus reference sequence which show how many reads of each length
aligned against the reference. The plot for SARS2 has a bimodal
distribution with one peak around length 151 and another peak around
length 35-40, but the plots for other viruses only have a single peak
around length 35-40, which consists of reads which did not actually
match the reference genome and which would have remained unaligned if he
ran BBMap with the default parameters. But in the plot for SARS2, the
y-axis is cut off in a deceptive way so you cannot see that the peak for
reads around length 151 is much higher than the peaks around length
35-40 in the plots for other viruses.</p>
<p>Wu et al. wrote that the longest contig they got with Trinity was
only 11,760 bases long, but that's because Trinity split the genome of
SARS2 into multiple shorter contigs, which probably either overlapped or
had only small gaps in between. In order to merge the contigs, Wu et
al. could've aligned all contigs against a related virus like ZC45 or
SARS1, and they could've selected the most common base at each spot of
the alignment. And if any gaps remained, Wu et al. could've filled in
the gaps by using segments on either end of the gap as PCR primers and
by sequencing the PCR amplicons. By default Trinity and MEGAHIT both
require a region of a genome to be covered by at least two contigs
before the contigs get merged, so Wu et al. may have also gotten Trinity
to merge the shorter contigs into a single contig if they would've added
the option <code>--min_glue 1</code> which reduces the minimum coverage
requirement from 2 to 1.</p>
<p>When I ran Trinity on Wu et al.'s raw reads without trimming, my
longest contig was 29,879 bases long, and it was otherwise identical to
the third version of Wuhan-Hu-1 except it included a 5-base insertion at
the 5' end, it had one nucleotide change in the middle, and it was
missing the last 29 bases of the poly(A) tail. When I ran Trinity again
after trimming the reads, my longest contig was 31,241 bases long
because there was a 1,379-base insertion in the middle which consisted
of two segments that were identical to two different parts of
Wuhan-Hu-1. The reason why Wu et al. failed to get a single complete
contig with Trinity may have been because they used a different method
to trim the reads, or because they used a different version of Trinity,
or because Trinity was confused by the human reads which had been masked
in my Trinity run.</p>
<p>In the current 29,903-base version of Wuhan-Hu-1, the poly(A) tail is
33 bases long, but the full poly(A) tail cannot be assembled from the
metagenomic raw reads because the full poly(A) tail is not included in
the raw reads. Wu et al. wrote that they sequenced the ends of the
genome with RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), which is a method
similar to PCR which only requires specifying a single primer instead of
two primers, so it can be used to amplify the end of a genome by
specifying a single segment near the end as the primer. In October 2020
when the sequence of RaTG13 was updated at GenBank so that a new 15-base
segment was added to the 5' end, some people from DRASTIC were
suspecting fraud because the 15-base segment was not included in the
metagenomic raw reads for RaTG13, but the segment was however included
in the RACE amplicon sequences for RaTG13 which were only published
later in 2021. But I believe the RACE amplicon sequences of Wuhan-Hu-1
have never been published.</p>
<p>When Wu et al. wrote that they determined the viral genome
organization of WHCV by aligning it against SARS-CoV Tor2 and bat
SL-CoVZC45, they meant that after they had already assembled the
complete genome of SARS2, they aligned it against SARS1 and ZC45 in
order to make annotating the proteins easier. So if for example they got
one open reading frame that started around position 21,500 and ended
around position 25,000, they knew that it was the spike protein if it
covered roughly the same region as the spike protein of SARS1. But they
did not mean that they aligned the raw reads of SARS2 against a SARS1
genome in order to do reference-based assembly.</p>
<p>USMortality did an experiment where he downloaded the reference
genomes of various viruses, he generated simulated short reads for the
genomes, and he tried to assemble the reads back together with MEGAHIT,
but he failed to get complete contigs for a couple of viruses, like
HKU1, HIV-1, HIV-2, and porcine adenovirus. But that's because the
reference genome of HKU1 contains a region where the same 30-base
segment is repeated 14 times in a row. And in HIV-1 and HIV-2 there's a
long terminal repeat where a long segment at the 5' end of the genome is
repeated at the 3' end of the genome. And porcine adenovirus contains a
tandem repeat where the same 724-base segment is repeated twice in a
row. Also when USMortality did another experiment where he mixed
together simulated reads from multiple different viruses and he ran
MEGAHIT on the mixed reads, he failed to get complete contigs for SARS2
and SARS1, but that's because the contigs were split at a spot where
there's a 74-base segment that is identical in the reference genomes of
SARS2 and SARS1, and when I repeated his experiment, I was able to get
complete contigs for SARS2 and SARS1 when I simply increased the maximum
k-value of MEGAHIT from 141 to 161.</p>
<p>One reason why USMortality says that the genome has not been
validated is that in all of Wu et al.'s reads which align against the
very start of the 5' end of Wuhan-Hu-1, there are 3-5 extra bases at the
start of the read that usually end with one or more G bases. However the
G bases are part of the template-switching oligo which anneals to
complementary C bases that are added to the 5' end of the RNA strand by
reverse transcriptase. USMortality also got two extra G bases at the
start of one of his MEGAHIT contigs, but I was able to get rid of them
by trimming 5 bases from the ends of reads.</p>

<p>The standard reference genome of SARS2 is known as Wuhan-Hu-1, and it
was described in a paper by Wu et al. titled <span class="quote">"A new

There's currently three versions of Wuhan-Hu-1 at GenBank: MN908947.1 is
30,474 bases long and it was published on January 12th 2020, MN908947.2
is 29,875 bases long and it was published on January 14th 2020, and
MN908947.3 is 29,903 bases long and it was published on January 17th
2020.

I believe the dates are in UTC and not in a local timezone.</p>
<p>Apart from a single nucleotide change in the N gene, the only
differences between the three versions are at the beginning of the
genome in the 5' UTR and at the end of the genome in the 3' UTR:</p>

bases from <code>CGGTGACGCATACAAAACATTCCCACC</code>, then it's identical
to a 24-base segment that's included near the end of all three versions

<p>I have found similar assembly errors in several other sarbecovirus
sequences, where there's a short segment at either end of the sequence
which consists of another part of the genome or its reverse complement.
For exaple in a sequence for the SARS1 isolate SoD, there's a 24-base
segment at the 3' end which is the reverse complement of another 24-base
segment near the 3' end:</p>

<p>Assembly errors like this are easy to spot if you do a multiple
sequence alignment of related virus sequences, and you then look for
inserts at the beginning or end of the alignment which are only included
in one sequence but missing from all other sequences. And you can then
do a BLAST search for the insert to find its origin.</p>
<p>The 3' end of the first version of Wuhan-Hu-1 accidentally included a
618-base segment of human DNA.

The first 20 of the 618 bases are part of the actual genome of SARS2
which may have confused MEGAHIT. You can do a BLAST search for the
618-base segment by going here:

<p>When I did a BLAST search for the first 150 bases of the Rs7907
sequence, the first 96 bases were 100% identical with several sequences
of mammalian DNA or rRNA, like for example there were results titled
<span class="quote">"PREDICTED: Pan troglodytes 18S ribosomal RNA
(LOC129143085), rRNA"</span> and <span class="quote">"Delphinus delphis
genome assembly, chromosome: 21"</span>.</p>
<p>In the paper where Rs7907 was published, the authors didn't describe
removing host reads before they did de-novo assembly: <span
class="quote">"For SARSr-CoV-positive RNA extraction, next-generation
sequencing (NGS) was performed using BGI MGISEQ 2000. NGS reads were
first processed using Cutadapt (v.1.18) to eliminate possible
contamination. Thereafter, the clean reads were assembled into genomes
using Geneious (v11.0.3) and MEGAHIT (v1.2.9). PCR and Sanger sequencing
were used to fill the genome gaps. To amplify the terminal ends, a
SMARTer RACE 5'/3'kit (Takara) was used."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344244/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344244/</a>]
(However I don't know if they did RACE for the 5' tail of Rs7907,
because they would've noticed the assembly error in their contig if they
would've incorporated the RACE sequences into their contig, or maybe
they just published their MEGAHIT contig without combining it with the
RACE sequences.)</p>
<p>The assembly error in the first version of Wuhan-Hu-1 was also
mentioned by Eddie Holmes, who tweeted that <span class="quote">"Zhang's
sequence did have some human sequences at the ends which we quickly
fixed"</span>.

And in an email to USMortality, Eddie Holmes also wrote: <span
class="quote">"I do know that the initial upload to Virological/GenBank
had some human DNA at the 5' and 3' ends that was then
corrected."</span>

However the insert at the 5' end did not actually come from the human
genome but from another part of the genome of SARS2.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Rapid_amplification_of_cDNA_ends_RACE id=Rapid_amplification_of_cDNA_ends_RACE>Rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)</a>
</h3>
<p>When the middle part of an RNA sequence is known but it's not certain
if the ends of the sequence are correct, the ends can be sequenced
accurately using method called RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends).
RACE is also known as <span class="quote">"one-sided PCR"</span> or
<span class="quote">"anchored PCR"</span>, and it basically requires
only specifying a single primer for each amplified segment instead of a
forward and reverse primer like in regular PCR.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_amplification_of_cDNA_ends>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_amplification_of_cDNA_ends</a>]</p>
<p>In the third version of Wuhan-Hu-1 at GenBank, an additional 44 bases
were inserted to the 3' end so that the poly(A) tail became 33 bases
long. I believe it's because the ends of the genome were sequenced with
RACE, because the paper by Wu et al. said: <span class="quote">"The
genome sequence of this virus, as well as its termini, were determined
and confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)10 and 5'/3' rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively."</span>

<p>Supplementary Table 6 shows the primers used to do RACE, where on
each row the number in parentheses is the expected length of the
amplicon which extends from the primer until the end of the genome:

<p>The third version of Wuhan-Hu-1 has a 33-base poly(A) tail, but I
think they sequenced the tail with RACE because there's only a few bases
of the tail included in the metagenomic reads published at the SRA. The
output below shows reads that aligned against the end of the third
version of Wuhan-Hu-1. To save space, I only included one read per each
starting position even though many positions have over ten aligned
reads. The first column shows the starting position and the second

<p>In the output above, there's a huge gap between positions 29,791 and
29,855 with no reads starting from the 63 positions in between. I think
it's because the reads after the gap don't actually come from SARS2 but
from some other organisms.</p>
<p>The last 50 bases of Wuhan-Hu-1 before the poly(A) tail are
<code>ATTTTAGTAGTGCTATCCCCATGTGATTTTAATAGCTTCTTAGGAGAATGAC</code>, which
is matched in the by the reads above the gap within a couple of
mismatches. But the first read below the gap starts with
<code>CTGTT</code> which has three nucleotide changes from
<code>ATGAC</code> at the corresponding position in Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>
<p>Out of the reads whose starting position is 29,700 or above, there's
only one read which has five A bases after the sequence
<code>ATGAC</code>:</p>

<p>In Supplementary Table 8 of Wu et al. 2020, there's a list of the PCR
primers they used to do PCR-based sequencing in order to verify the
results of the metagenomic de-novo assembly they did with MEGAHIT.
[<a href=https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2008-3/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2008_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2008-3/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2008_MOESM1_ESM.pdf</a>]
The last reverse primer is <code>AAAATCACATGGGGATAGCACTACT</code> which
is shown to end at position 29,864, so I guess I guess by the time they
designed the primers, they had already noticed that they accidentally
included a piece of human DNA at the beginning of the first version of
Wuhan-Hu-1 at GenBank. The first forward primer is
<code>CCAGGTAACAAACCAACCAACTT</code> and it's shown to start at position
36, which matches the coordinates in the first and second version of
Wuhan-Hu-1 but not the third version, so I guess they designed the
primers based on the second version. However another part of
Supplementary Table 8 says that the <span class="quote">"primers for
WHCV detection using qPCR"</span> were <span class="quote">"designed
based on the whole genome of WHCV (MN908947.3)"</span>, and the
coordinates of the primers match the third version of Wuhan-Hu-1 at
GenBank and not the second version. So I guess Wu et al. designed
different sets of primers based on different versions of the genome.</p>

<p>Below I ran MEGAHIT for Wu et al.'s lung metagenomic reads. When I
did trimming with <code>fastp</code>, my longest contig was 29,802 bases
long and it missed the last 102 bases of MN908947.3 and had an insertion
of one base at the beginning. When I did trimming with
<code>trimmomatic</code>, my longest contig was 29,875 bases long and
now it only missed the last 30 bases of MN908947.3 even though it still
had the single-base insertion at the beginning:</p>

<p>The paper by Wu et al. says: <span class="quote">"In total, we

screened for potential aetiological agents. Of the 384,096 contigs
assembled by Megahit [9], the longest (30,474 nucleotides (nt)) had a
high abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus
(CoV) isolate - bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession number MG772933) -
that had previously been sampled in China, with a nucleotide identity of
89.1% (Supplementary Tables 1, 2)."</span>. And 56,565,928 is identical

<p>In Wu et al.'s metagenomic dataset, about half of the reads have been
masked entirely so that they consist of only <code>N</code> bases:</p>

<p>So it could be that by the time Wu et al. submitted the reads to SRA,
they had noticed that their initial 30,474-base contig included a
segment of human DNA at the end, so maybe they replaced the reads which
matched human DNA with reads that consisted of only N letters. That
would explain why the number of reads at SRA is the same as the number
of reads which produced their 30,474-base contig but why the contig
cannot be reproduced. But it could be that at the point when they
noticed the assembly error in MN908947.1, they were no longer able to
update the main text of their paper in Nature, which might explain why
the assembly error in MN908947.1 was accounted for in Supplementary
Table 8 but not in the main text of the paper.</p>
<p>Wu et al. wrote that about 24 million reads out of about 57 million
reads remained after human reads were filtered out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequencing reads were first adaptor and quality trimmed using the
Trimmomatic program[32]. The <strong>remaining 56,565,928 reads</strong>
were assembled de novo using both Megahit (v.1.1.3)[9] and Trinity
(v.2.5.1)[33] with default parameter settings. Megahit generated a total
of 384,096 assembled contigs (size range of 200-30,474 nt), whereas
Trinity generated 1,329,960 contigs with a size range of 201-11,760 nt.
All of these assembled contigs were compared (using BLASTn and Diamond
BLASTx) against the entire non-redundant (nr) nucleotide and protein
databases, with e values set to 1 × 10−10 and 1 × 10−5, respectively. To
identify possible aetiological agents present in the sequencing data,
the abundance of the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the
expected counts using the RSEM program[34] implemented in Trinity.
<strong>Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads), generated by filtering host
reads using the human genome</strong> (human release 32, GRCh38.p13,
downloaded from Gencode) by Bowtie2[35], were used for the RSEM
abundance assessment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However in the STAT analysis for the reads uploaded to SRA, only
about 0.1% of the reads match <em>Homo sapiens</em>, about 0.8% of the
reads match simians, and about 4.6% of the reads match eukaryotes.
There's also an unusually low percentage of only 39% identified reads,
because the half of reads which consist of only <code>N</code> bases are
unidentified:</p>

[<a href=https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/02/02/scrubbing-human-sequences-sra-submissions/>https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/02/02/scrubbing-human-sequences-sra-submissions/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Human Read Removal Tool (HRRT; also known as the Human Scrubber)
is available on GitHub and DockerHub. The HRRT is based on the SRA
Taxonomy Analysis Tool (STAT) that will take as input a fastq file and
produce as output a fastq.clean file in which all reads identified as
potentially of human origin are masked with <span
class="quote">'N'</span>.</p>
<p>You may also request that NCBI applies the HRRT to all SRA data
linked to your submitted BioProject (more information below). When
requested, all data previously submitted to the BioProject will be
queued for scrubbing, and any future data submitted to the BioProject
will be automatically scrubbed at load time.</p>
<p>This tool can be particularly helpful when a submission could be
contaminated with human reads not consented for public display. Clinical
pathogen and human metagenome samples are common submission types that
benefit from applying the Human Scrubber tool.</p>
<p>For more information on genome data sharing policies, consult with
institutional review boards and the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. It
is the responsibility of submitting parties to ensure that they have
appropriate consent for human sequence data to be distributed publicly
without access controls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usage message of the Human Scrubber tool also says that human
reads are masked with N bases by default.

</h3>
<p>Wu et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"Of the 384,096 contigs
assembled by Megahit [9], the longest (30,474 nucleotides (nt)) had a
high abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus
(CoV) isolate—bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession number MG772933)—that
had previously been sampled in China, with a nucleotide identity of
89.1% (Supplementary Tables 1, 2)."</span> Some Lankatards think that
because there were about 400,000 contigs, it means that MEGAHIT produced
about 400,000 candidate genomes for the virus but one of them was
arbitrarily selected to be the genome of SARS2, and Lankatards also
don't understand why Wu et al. selected the longest contig.</p>
<p>However the longest contig happened to be the contig for SARS2 by
accident, and when I have ran MEGAHIT on other metagenomic samples which
have contained a coronavirus, I have sometimes gotten bacterial contigs
which were longer than the longest coronavirus contig. For example here
where I ran MEGAHIT on a sample of bat shit that contained the bat
sarbecovirus RmYN02, my longest contig was a contig for <em>E. coli</em>
which was about 50,000 bases long, and the 2nd-longest and 3rd-longest
contigs also matched <em>E coli.</em>, but the contig for RmYN02 was
only the 4th-longest contig:</p>

<p>If Wu et al. would've had a larger number of reads, they might have
also gotten bacterial contigs with a length over 30,474 bases, because
then their additional reads might have filled in the gap between two
contigs for different regions of a bacterial genome so that they
would've been joined together into a single contig.</p>
<p>You can find out which contigs are viral by doing a BLAST search for
each contig, like what Wu et al. did in their Supplementary Table 1. It
shows that apart from the contig for SARS2, all of their other most
abundant contigs were bacterial:

<img src=i/hamburgmath-wu-supplementary.jpg width=600>

<p>You can also find out which contigs are viral by trying to align all
contigs against a FASTA file for virus reference sequences. For example
here I ran MEGAHIT on Wu et al.'s raw reads. I got only 29,463 instead
of 384,096 contigs because human reads were masked with N bases in the
version of Wu et al.'s reads that were uploaded to the SRA:</p>

<p>When I aligned all contigs against virus refseqs, I got only 8
aligned contigs. There was only contig for SARS2 because the contig
covered almost the entire genome of the virus apart from a part of the
3' UTR so the genome was not split into multiple shorter contigs.
There's 4 contigs which matched different parts of the human endogenous
retrovirus K113, which is usually matched by human reads because the
genomes of HERVs are incorporated as part of the human genome. There was
also one short contig that matched a <em>Streptococcus</em>
bacteriophage, and there were two short contigs which matched a
parvovirus:</p>

<p>MEGAHIT uses a default minimum length of 200 bases for contigs, but I
only got two 200-base contigs. When I did a BLAST search for the first
contig, it matched the human genome (because a small number of human
reads remained in the raw reads at the SRA even though the vast majority
of human reads were masked). And when I did a BLAST search for the other
contig, it had a 100% match with about 80% coverage for ribosomal RNA
sequences of <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, and some other
bacteria:</p>

<p>But basically many of these shorter contigs match different parts of
bacterial genomes. And there's only a tiny number of contigs for
viruses. And the original reads by Wu et al. also had a lot of human
contigs because human reads had not been masked with N bases.</p>

results of SRA reads</a>
</h3>
<p>The sequencing runs at the SRA have been analyzed with a program
called STAT, which stands for SRA Taxonomic Analysis Tool. STAT relies
on matches to 32-base k-mers to classify each read under some node in a
taxonomical tree, where it's able to classify some reads on the
species-level but other reads are only classified at higher taxonomical
levels.

It shows that about 61% of reads are unidentified, about 33% of reads

<a href=#Results_of_Trinity_runs id=Results_of_Trinity_runs>Results of
Trinity runs</a>
</h3>
<p>Trinity is a lot slower than MEGAHIT, and it requires more RAM and
more free disk space, so the first few times when I ran it on my local
computer, I either ran out of disk space, or I ran out of RAM so it had
to use swap and I terminated the run. I think it required around 20-30
GB RAM and around 50 GB disk space to assemble Wu et al.'s reads. The
<code>--max_memory</code> flag which specifies a maximum limit for RAM
and swap use cannot be omitted, and one of the first times I ran Trinity
I think it was interrupted in the middle of the run because it exceeded
the <code>--max_memory</code> limit. Running Trinity took about 24 hours
on a server with 16 cores:</p>
<pre>trinity --seqType fq --left SRR10971381_1.fastq --right SRR10971381_2.fastq --max_memory 50G --CPU 16 --output trinityout</pre>
<p>The contigs produced by Trinity can be downloaded from here:
<a href=f/Trinity.fasta.gz>f/Trinity.fasta.gz</a>.</p>
<p>I got a total of only 159,532 contigs even though Wu et al. wrote
that they got 1,329,960 contigs with Trinity, but it's probably because
I used the reads that are publicly available at the SRA where almost all
human reads are masked, so I got only a small number of human
contigs.</p>
<p>My Trinity run produced six contigs for SARS2 but the longest contig
is 29,869 bases even though Wu et al.'s longest contig was only 11,760
bases. It might be because I didn't trim the reads before I ran Trinity,
or because human reads were masked in my run but not in Wu et al.'s run,
or because I used a different version of Trinity than Wu et al.:</p>

<p>The reason why the longest contig is shown to have 10 mismatches in
the BAM file is that Bowtie2 doesn't allow gaps within the first 4 bases
of the read by default, so it treated the first 4 bases as mismatches
and it added a 5-base insert after them:</p>
<pre>$ bowtie2 -h|grep gbar
  --gbar &lt;int&gt;       disallow gaps within &lt;int&gt; nucs of read extremes (4)</pre>
<p>I don't know why Trinity produced 6 different contigs without merging
them into a single contig, even though the longest contig covered the
entire genome apart from the poly(A) tail. However it could be because
the reads were not trimmed properly so there were mismatches in the
middle of the contigs.</p>
<p>Out of my 6 contigs, the shortest 233-base contig matched positions
28,394 to 28,626 of Wuhan-Hu-1. It has 3 wrong bases at the start of the
contig, but it might be because many reads have 3-5 bases of extra crap
at the ends but I didn't trim the ends of reads. The shortest contig
also has 6 errors where a T base was changed to an A base, which may
have been because A bases have the lowest average quality and I didn't
trim low-quality bases from the ends of reads:</p>

<p>When I ran Trinity a second time so that I trimmed the reads with

31,241. Now only two contigs aligned against SARS2, but the longer
contig was 31,241 bases long because it had a 1,379-base insertion in
the middle, and the shorter contig also had the same 1,379-base

<p>When I did a BLAST search for the insert, it started with a 64-base
segment which was identical to bases 29,109-29,172 of Wuhan-Hu-1 which
was followed by a 1,315-base segment which was identical to bases
27,794-29,108 of Wuhan-Hu-1. So even though the starting position of the
first segment was one base bigger than the ending position of the second
segment, for some reason the order of the two segments was flipped in
the insert.</p>

<p>However the authors meant that after they had already assembled the
complete genome of SARS2, they aligned it against the genomes of SARS1
and ZC45 in order to annotate the proteins corresponding to each ORF.
They didn't mean that they used SARS1 as a reference genome when they
assembled the raw reads.</p>
<p>You can try running NCBI's ORFfinder on the genome of SARS2. Go here,
enter <code>NC_045512</code> as the accession number, enable the option
to ignore nested ORFs, and click submit:

ends at position 25,384:</p>

<img src=i/hamburgmath-orf.jpg width=700>

<p>In order to know what name you should give to the protein coded by
the ORF, you can check which protein SARS1 has around the same region.
But it happens to be the spike protein:</p>

<p>But for example the ORF6 of Wuhan-Hu-1 starts at position 27,202, so
if you simply looked at which ORF in SARS1 is the closest to it but you
didn't align the sequences, it would be ORF7a. But if you align the
sequences, then the ORF6 of SARS2 and SARS1 will have the same starting
position so it's easier to do the annotation:</p>

<p>The website of the NCBI's sequence read archive has a tab which shows
a breakdown of what percentage of reads are estimated to come from
different organisms and different taxonomial nodes. The tab displays the
results a program called SRA Taxonomy Analysis Tool (STAT), which
searches for 32-base k-mers among the reads which match a set of
reference sequences. A database which contains the number of reads which
match each taxonomical node for each SRA run is currently about 500 GB
in size, but you can search it through BigQuery at the Google Cloud
Platform.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-cloud-based-taxonomy-analysis-table/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-cloud-based-taxonomy-analysis-table/</a>]
I tried using BigQuery to search for the oldest sequencing runs which
matched over 10,000 reads of SARS2 (taxid2697049):</p>
<pre>select * from `nih-sra-datastore.sra.metadata` as m, `nih-sra-datastore.sra_tax_analysis_tool.tax_analysis` as tax where m.acc=tax.acc and tax_id=2697049 and total_count&gt;10000 order by releasedate</pre>
<p>I got 17 results from before 2020 but all of them had zero reads
which aligned against Wuhan-Hu-1 when I used Bowtie2 with the default
settings. The oldest results I found which had reads that aligned
against SARS2 were runs for the samples WHU01 and WHU02 which were
submitted by Wuhan University and published on January 18th 2020 (in an
unknown timezone).

had a bunch of non-A bases near the end of the read and it only had 48
contiguous A bases. But I also got another read with 47 contiguous A
bases, another with 39, and another with 38. And may of the long
segments of A bases are preceded by <code>GAATGAC</code> which are also
the last bases of Wuhan-Hu-1 before the poly(A) tail. So I don't know if
the included samples of SARS2 which actually had a poly(A) tail longer
than 33 bases or if its's just some kind of an artifact:</p>

<p>Some people were saying that it was somehow problematic that the full
poly(A) tail of Wuhan-Hu-1 could not be reproduced from the metagenomic
sequencing run of Wu et al. 2020. However above I have shown that
there's another early metagenomic sequencing run of SARS2 where the
reads actually feature a long poly(A) tail.</p>
<p>When I additionally ran MEGAHIT on the reads of the WHU02 sample, my
longest contig was 29,997 bases long, and it was otherwise identical to
Wuhan-Hu-1 except it had an insertion of 109 bases at the beginning,
there was one nucleotide change after the insertion, and the poly(A)
tail was missing the last 15 bases. When I did a BLAST search for the
109-base insertion, I found that it was 100% identical to the reverse
complement of the segment between positions 191 and 299 in
Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>In order to test if the genome of SARS2 can be assembled from other
metagenomic datasets, I searched the SRA for the phrase
<code>human bronchoalveolar pneumonia</code>.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=human+bronchoalveolar+pneumonia>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=human+bronchoalveolar+pneumonia</a>]
I picked the first result which was from a study titled <span

When I ran MEGAHIT with the default settings, I got a total of about 500
contigs with a maximum length of about 8,000. When I aligned the contigs
against a file of about 15,000 virus reference sequences, I got only 14
aligned contigs, none of which matched SARS2:</p>

<p>The contigs which matched human endogenous retrovirus K113 probably
just matched the human genome. When I did a BLAST search for the longest
contig, it got a 98.9% identical match to both some human endogenous
retroviruses and to human DNA. When I downloaded other metagenomic
sequencing runs for human lung or BALF samples from SRA and aligned the
reads against virus refseqs, human endogenous retrovirus K113 got the
highest coverage for most runs, including SRR22183691, SRR22183705,
SRR1553689, and SRR22183702. And when I did a BLAST search for the full
sequence of K113, it was about 98.8% identical to a segment of human
DNA.</p>

<p>Below I aligned 194 sequences of SARS1 and then printed the last 100
bases of the alignment. You can see that there's a lot of variation in
the length of the poly(A) tail, and many sequences are even missing a

<p>In a paper titled <span class="quote">"The Architecture of SARS-CoV-2
Transcriptome"</span>, the authors wrote: <span class="quote">"We
recently developed software to measure the length of poly(A) tail from
DRS data (Y. Choi and H.C., unpublished data). Using this software, we
confirm that, like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs carry poly(A) tails
(Figures 4A-4B). The tail of viral RNAs is 47 nt in median length. The
full-length gRNA has a relatively longer tail than sgRNAs. Notably,
sgRNAs have two tail populations: a minor peak at ∼30 nt and a major
peak at ∼45 nt (Figure 4B, arrowheads). Wu et al., 2013 previously
observed that the poly(A) tail length of bovine CoV mRNAs changes during
infection: from ∼45 nt immediately after virus entry to ∼65 nt at 6-9
hours post-infection and ∼30 nt at 120-144 hours post-infection. Thus,
the short tails of ∼30 nt observed in this study may represent aged RNAs
that are prone to decay."</span>

<p>On GISAID, the SARS2 sequence with the oldest collection date is
EPI_ISL_402123 (IPBCAMS-WH-01), which is listed as being collected on
2019-12-24. The sample was described in a paper by Ren et al. which was
only published in May 2020.

<p>If you search the NCBI's sequence read archive for something like
<code>sars nanopore</code>, almost all results employ a PCR-based
sequencing protocol where RNA is converted to cDNA and then segments of
cDNA are amplified with PCR. The amplicon length is around 400 bases in
the ARCTIC protocol and around 1,200 bases in the MIDNIGHT protocol.</p>
<p>However in a variant of nanopore sequencing called direct RNA
nanopore sequencing, the conversion to cDNA is not needed, and the read
lengths can exceed 10,000 bases. A paper from 2019 described using
direct RNA nanopore sequencing to sequence almost the entire length of a
coronavirus in a single piece.
[<a href=https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/9/1545.full>https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/9/1545.full</a>]</p>
<p>When I searched the SRA for <code>direct rna nanopore sars</code>,
there were only 130 results.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=direct+rna+nanopore+sars>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=direct+rna+nanopore+sars</a>]
In many runs, the maximum read length was only a few thousand bases, but
I found one run where the longest SARS2 read was over 10,000 bases long.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR11300652>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR11300652</a>]
The longest read in the entire run was about 52,000 bases, but the
longest read that aligned against SARS2 was 14,191 bases long and it had
about 93% identity with Wuhan-Hu-1:</p>

<p>In 2022, someone who called themselves <span class="quote">"a
mathematician from Hamburg, who would like to remain unknown"</span>
published a paper titled <span class="quote">"Structural analysis of
sequence data in virology: An elementary approach using SARS-CoV-2 as an
example"</span>.
[<a href=https://impfen-nein-danke.de/u/structural_analysis_of_sequence_data_in_virology.pdf>https://impfen-nein-danke.de/u/structural_analysis_of_sequence_data_in_virology.pdf</a>,

<p>When the mathematician from Hamburg aligned Wu et al.'s reads with
BBMap against reference genomes of HIV-1, hepatitis delta, and measles,
he was able to get a large number of aligned reads, but that's because
he ran BBMap with the <code>minratio=0.1</code> parameter which caused
it to tolerate a very high number of mismatches, so the most common
length of his aligned reads was about 35-40 bases, and the average error
rate among the reads was about 40%. And when he filtered his reads with
<code>reformat.sh</code>, he also used a low required minimum length
(37) and an extremely low required identity percent (60%). His paper
says that he ran BBMap with <span class="quote">"relatively unspecific
settings"</span>, but actually he ran it with extremely liberal
alignment criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, we mapped the paired-end reads (2x151 bp) with BBMap [23]
to the reference sequences we considered (Tables and Figures: Table 3)
using relatively unspecific settings. We then varied the minimum length
(M1) and minimum (nucleotide) identity (M2) with reformat.sh to obtain
corresponding subsets of the previously mapped sequences with
appropriate quality. Increasing minimum length M1 or minimum nucleotide
identity M2 thereby increases the significance of the respective
mapping. Subsequently, we formed consensus sequences with the respective
subsets of selected quality with respect to the selected reference. We
set all bases with a quality lower than 20 to <span
class="quote">"N"</span> (unknown). A quality of 20 means an error rate
of 1% per nucleotide, which can be considered sufficient in the context
of our analyses. Finally, the assessment of the agreement between
reference and consensus sequences was performed using BWA [24], Samtools
[25], and Tablet [26]. The ordered pair (M1; M2) = (37; 0.6) was just
chosen to give error rates F1 and F2, respectively, of less than 10% for
reference LC312715.1. The results of all calculations performed are
shown in Tables and Figures: Table 4. The calculations show the highest
significance for the choice of the ordered pair (37; 0.6), which can be
seen from the highest error rates in each case. Comparable significance
is provided by the ordered pairs (47; 0.50) and (25; 0.62). While the
genome sequences associated with coronaviruses show error rates
approximately above 10% for all ordered pairs considered (M1; M2), the
error rates of the two sequences LC312715.1 (HIV) and NC_001653.2
(Hepatitis delta) are below 10% and decrease further for the ordered
pairs (32; 0.60) and (30; 0.60).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the figure below, you can see that the mode length was around
150 bases for the reads which aligned against Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3),
but the mode length was around 35-40 bases for the reads which aligned
against HIV-1, hepatitis delta, measles, and randomly generated
sequences:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>I don't understand why the figure above shows that there's some reads
shorter than 37 bases even though the caption indicates that reads
shorter than 37 bases were filtered out with
<code>reformat.sh</code>.</p>
<p>And I also don't understand why the figure above shows that there
were reads longer than 151 bases which aligned against Wuhan-Hu-1,
because Wu et al.'s raw reads don't include any reads longer than 151
bases. Maybe the mathematician from Hamburg counted gaps in the middle
of the aligned reads as part of the reads, or maybe he calculated read
lengths based on the CIGAR strings so that he added together all numbers
in the CIGAR string without skipping deletions relative to the
reference. His paper indicated that he ran BBMap with the
<code>maxindel=0</code> parameter which doesn't allow indels, but it
might be that he forgot to include the parameter in the run where he
used Wuhan-Hu-1 as the reference, since there doesn't seem to be reads
longer than 151 bases in the plots for other reference sequences
above.</p>
<p>In the plot for SARS-CoV-2 above, there's two peaks for the length of
the aligned reads, where the first peak around length 37 looks almost as
high as the second peak around length 150, but it's misleading that the
y-axis is cut off so you can't see the full height of the second peak. I
tried aligning Wu et al.'s raw reads against Wuhan-Hu-1 so that I ran
<code>mapPacBio.sh</code> and <code>reformat.sh</code> with the same
parameters as the mathematician from Hamburg, but I got about 11 times
as many aligned reads of length 151 as reads of length 37:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>So you can compare my plot above to the plot by the mathematician by
Hamburg to see how misleading it was that he cut off the y-axis,
especially since it's the long reads with length around 151 that
actually matched the virus reference sequences, and the short reads with
length around 30-50 bases consisted of spurious matches that would have
remained unaligned if BBMap was ran with regular parameters.</p>
<p>Next I tried aligning Wu et al.'s reads against other reference
genomes, where I again ran BBMap and <code>reformat.sh</code> with the
same parameters as the mathematician from Hamburg:</p>

<p>The plot below shows the result of my BBMap alignment. If you compare
SARS2 to HIV-1, hepatitis delta, or the random sequence, they all have a
similar mismatch rate and similar number of aligned reads at the lowest
read lengths, but after around length 55, the mismatch rate of SARS2
starts to drop until it reaches about 2% at length 151. However the
mismatch rate of the other sequences remains at around 40% even for
longer reads:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath3.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Hepatitis delta has an extremely short genome of only about 1,700
bases, so in the plot above, hepatitis delta gets less aligned reads at
lengths 37 to 60 than the longer genomes. I don't know why the
difference between hepatitis delta and the longer genomes is not bigger
though, even though SARS2 and the random 30-kb genome are almost 20
times longer than hepatitis delta, but it might be because the longer
sequences are more likely to include multimapped reads which I omitted
from this analysis. Or it might be because I ran BBMap with such loose
alignment criteria that even for a short reference genome, random short
reads are likely to get aligned against some part of the genome.</p>
<p>(The number of mismatches is indicated by the <code>NM</code> tag in
the SAM file format. For some reason BBMap doesn't include the
<code>NM</code> tag for multimapped reads, which are reads that can map
to two or more spots in the reference genome and which are indicated by
a zero in the fifth column of the SAM file. Therefore I omitted
multimapped reads from the plot above in order to calculate the average
number of mismatches correctly.)</p>

<p>The page below from the paper by the mathematician from Hamburg is a
bit confusing, because in the table at the top he uses the term <span
class="quote">"short reads"</span> to refer to sequencing reads with a
short length, but at the end of the paragraph I highlighted he uses the
term <span class="quote">"short reads"</span> to refer to sequencing
reads in general, even though the set of about 120,000 reads he referred
to mostly consisted of long reads with length above 100 bases. So in the
last paragraph below, what he meant is that the reads which actually
matched SARS2 were mostly long reads:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath-shortreads.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The mathematician from Hamburg wrote that among the reads with a
maximum length of 100 bases, the average mismatch rate was about 30%,
but that's because he ran BBMap with the <code>minratio=0.1</code>
parameter which tolerated an extremely high number of mismatches.
However there's also some reads with a short length which genuinely
match SARS2, and he would've been able to differentiate them from the
spurious matches if he ran BBMap with the default parameters, or if he
used <code>reformat.sh</code> to filter out reads with a high mismatch
rate, or if he simply looked at which reads got aligned when he ran
Bowtie2 with the default settings:</p>

<p>When I tried aligning Wu et al.'s reads with Bowtie2, I got zero
reads that aligned against HIV-1, hepatitis delta, measles, or the
random sequence. I got 121,779 reads which aligned against SARS2, which
was identical to the figure reported by the mathematician from Hamburg,
because both of us did trimming with <code>fastp</code> using the
default parameters.</p>
<p>With Bowtie2, the shortest reads that aligned against SARS2 were 31
bases long. There were less than a hundred reads at each length below
89, and their error rate was much lower than in the case of BBMap.
However after around length 100-120, the results of Bowtie2 start to
converge with BBMap:</p>

<a href=#Parameters_used_with_BBMap id=Parameters_used_with_BBMap>Parameters
used with BBMap</a>
</h3>
<p>When I googled for <code>"minratio=0.1" "bbmap"</code>, I found that
the BBTools user guide included the command
<code>mapPacBio.sh in=reads.fq out=mapped.sam vslow k=8 maxindel=200 minratio=0.1</code>,
with the comment that the command can be used to <span
class="quote">"map with super-high sensitivity (useful for
very-low-quality data, or remote homologies)"</span>.
[<a href=https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/>https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/</a>]</p>
<p>A list of shell commands used by the mathematician from Hamburg
featured this BBMap command:
<code>mapPacBio.sh in=SRR10971381_1.fastq in2=SRR10971381_2.fastq outm=mapped.sam vslow k=8 maxindel=0 minratio=0.1</code>.
So maybe he copied the command from the BBTools user guide, because he
even used the same output file name <code>mapped.sam</code>, he listed
the parameters in the same order, and he used <code>mapPacBio.sh</code>
instead of <code>bbmap.sh</code>.</p>
<p>The value for the K-mer length can range from 8 to 15, where the
default value is <code>k=13</code> and lower values are more sensitive.
So the mathematician from Hamburg used the most sensitive possible value
for the K-mer length.</p>
<p>The <code>minratio</code> parameter is no longer listed in the help
message of BBMap, but I think it's because it has the same effect as the
<code>minid</code> parameter but it uses a different scale, so it's
basically redundant and the developer of BBMap recommended using
<code>minid</code> instead. The default value for <code>minid</code> is
0.76 which is approximately equal to <code>minratio=0.56</code>. The
developer of BBMap wrote the following:
[<a href=https://www.biostars.org/p/376782/>https://www.biostars.org/p/376782/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the confusion; they set the same thing, just with different
units. <span class="quote">"minratio"</span> is the internal number
using the internal scoring system; if you use the <span
class="quote">"minid"</span> flag it converts it to the equivalent
minratio. So if you set <span class="quote">"minid=0.76"</span> then it
will be converted to approximately <span
class="quote">"minratio=0.56"</span> and then the minratio variable will
be set to 0.56. So there is no reason to set both of them. If you do set
both of them, the last value will be used. I recommend minid over
minratio because it is easier to read, but they accomplish the same
thing.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"minid"</span> is approximate since it adjusts
minratio, or the ratio of the maximum possible internal score, but the
internal score is not directly related to percent identity because of
different penalties for substitutions, deletions, and insertions, which
vary by length. If you need an exact %identity cutoff, use <span
class="quote">"idfilter=0.76"</span> which will eliminate all alignments
below 76% identity, as a postfilter. <span
class="quote">"minratio/minid"</span> actually affect mapping, and
prevent the creation of any alignments with an internal score below
<span class="quote">"minratio"</span>. As such, a high value of minid
will make the program faster and a low value will make it slower.
Whereas <span class="quote">"idfilter"</span> does not affect speed.</p>
<p>That said, I don't recommend using <span
class="quote">"idfilter"</span> unless you have a good reason (like, a
paper with a graph showing %identity cutoffs, for clarity; not for
something like variant calling). <span
class="quote">"minid/minratio"</span> are proportional to the internal
score which should better model actual mutations or evolution, by trying
to minimize the number of independant events rather than the edit
distance; <span class="quote">"idfilter=0.5"</span>, for example, will
disallow a 100bp read from mapping with a 400bp deletion in the middle,
since that would be only 20% identity. <span
class="quote">"minid=0.5"</span> would allow this mapping because the
internal score would actually still be quite high (maybe 0.9 of the
maximum possible ratio).</p>

for the reference genomes LC312715.1 (HIV) and NC_001653.2 (Hepatitis

bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank: MG772933.1), which led to the origin hypothesis
of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we were able to substantiate our hypothesis that
the claimed viral genome sequences are misinterpretations in the sense
that they have been or are being constructed unnoticed from non-viral
nucleic acid fragments."</span> Table 4 of the supplementary PDF shows
that the error rate for ZC45 was 10.2% for both forward and reverse

<p>The ZC45 consensus had <code>N</code> bases but the HIV consensus
didn't, which might partially explain why the ZC45 consensus had a
higher error rate. The reads that aligned against HIV were short and
they didn't actually come from HIV, so the errors in the reads may have
been random enough that they ended up canceling each other out in the
consensus sequence. But in the case of ZC45 many of the aligned reads
actually came from SARS2, so they had a systematic profile of mismatches
at the spots where SARS2 was different from ZC45 so the mismatches
didn't get canceled out. The ZC45 consensus actually got a lower error
rate when I aligned it against the SARS2 reference instead of the ZC45
reference:</p>

Cowan's claim that Wu et al.'s contig was manually modified to support
the lab leak narrative</a>
</h3>
<p>In October 2023, Tom Cowan published a video where he claimed that
because the longest contig generated by the mathematician from Hamburg
was not identical to the longest contig reported by Wu et al., it meant
that Wu et al. manually manipulated their contig so they added in
features which made the genome seem like it had been tinkered in a lab,
and therefore they managed to trick people into believing in the lab
leak narrative.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Jt7uiAp9LfWs/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Jt7uiAp9LfWs/</a>]
So Cowan said that therefore the paper by Wu et al. laid the foundation
for the lab leak narrative.</p>
<p>Cowan said: <span class="quote">"The Fan Wu people made this whole
30,000-string nucleotide up and specifically put in parts that would
guarantee there would be this lab leak story, then that is the origin of
the story. [...] With those 56 million plus pieces, can you actually
assemble this 30,000 base pair genome, or did they simply make it up
from scratch - not from scratch, they took what they got and then
manually - in other words, these Fan Wu group put on the dodo bird part
deliberately and specifically, and it was not actually in the original
reads."</span> [time 32:50] And a bit later Cowan said: <span
class="quote">"So us - meaning Stefan and our group that helped fund
this - hired a mathematician who could do the sequencing, and said,
<span class="quote">'Here, take these 56 million reads and see if you
can get this 30,000 base pair genome.'</span> And surprise surprise, he
can't. That genome doesn't exist out of that raw data, which can only
mean, and I mean <em>only mean</em>, that the Fan Wu group made that
genome up based on - they took some 26, 28 thousand, 25 thousand - we
don't know - and then actually added on manually pieces and specifically
made them look like flesh-eating dodo bird beaks. In other words, they
put, quote, <span class="quote">'scary spike protein'</span> and <span
class="quote">'cleavage site'</span> sequences from other published
sequences like HIV, and put those not into a particle, not into a virus
that can be released, but into the computer database. That is the only
place that genome exists, not in the real world."</span> [time 40:00] (I
didn't even know that the mathematician from Hamburg was hired by
Lanka's group. Maybe he should've disclosed it as a conflict of
interest.)</p>
<p>I tried running <code>fastp</code> and MEGAHIT with the same
parameters that were listed in the paper by the mathematician from
Hamburg:</p>

<p>My longest contig was 29,802 bases long like in the case of the
mathematician from Hamburg, so it's probably identical to his contig.
When I compared my contig to the first 30,474-base version of Wuhan-Hu-1
at GenBank, there was one nucleotide change in the nucleocapsid gene at
position 29,293 of the alignment, but all other differences were in the
untranslated regions at the beginning and end of the genome (so there
were no differences in the regions of the spike protein which contain
the HIV-like inserts or the furin cleavage site):</p>

contig differs from the first version of Wuhan-Hu-1, where the first
column shows the position of the segment, the second column shows the
segment in my longest contig, and the third column shows the segment in
the first version of Wuhan-Hu-1. From the last line of the output above,
you can see that the first version of Wuhan-Hu-1 ends with a long piece
of the human genome but my longest contig only has gaps at the
corresponding region of the alignment. You can try copying the
nucleotide sequence from the last line above, and then paste it to the

It shows that the sequence has 99.7% match to a human genome with about
93% query coverage (where there's not 100% coverage because BLAST
skipped the first 38 bases of the segment because they came from the
genome of SARS2 but they were missing from my contig).</p>

<p>Mark Bailey's article titled <span class="quote">"Farewell to

about genetic sequencing and PCR. In a video about the second part that
was done by Steve Falconer from Spacebusters, he asked: <span

gun."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/p1bkp55x78aK/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/p1bkp55x78aK/</a>,
time 1:48:20] Then he showed a part of the paper by the mathematician
from Hamburg which said: <span class="quote">"At this point, the contig
with the identification k141_27232, with which 1,407,705 sequences are
associated, and thus about 5% of the remaining 26,108,482 sequences,
should be discussed in detail. Alignment with the nucleotide database on
05/12/2021 showed a high match (98.85%) with <span class="quote">'Homo
sapiens RNA, 45S pre-ribosomal N4 (RNA45SN4), ribosomal RNA'</span>
(GenBank: NR_146117.1, dated 04/07/2020). This observation contradicts
the claim in [1] that ribosomal RNA depletion was performed and human
sequence reads were filtered using the human reference genome (human
release 32, GRCh38.p13)."</span> And then Falconer asked: <span
class="quote">"If you filter out the human reads, then why are they
still in your virus genome?"</span></p>
<p>However the part of the paper he quoted wasn't talking about the
contig for SARS2, but about another contig assembled by MEGAHIT which
consisted of a part of the human genome. In the supplementary PDF
published by the mathematician from Hamburg, you can see the best BLAST
hits for the contig if you search for <span
class="quote">"k141_27232"</span> (or look at rows 12-16 of the table in
the image below).
[<a href=https://impfen-nein-danke.de/u/structural_analysis_of_sequence_data_in_virology_tables_and_figures.pdf>https://impfen-nein-danke.de/u/structural_analysis_of_sequence_data_in_virology_tables_and_figures.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>When the mathematician from Hamburg wrote that <span
class="quote">"human sequence reads were filtered using the human
reference genome"</span>, he referred to a part of the paper by Wu et
al. which said: <span class="quote">"To identify possible aetiological
agents present in the sequencing data, the abundance of the assembled
contigs was first evaluated as the expected counts using the RSEM
program3[4] implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads),
generated by filtering host reads using the human genome (human release
32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded from Gencode) by Bowtie[235], were used for
the RSEM abundance assessment."</span> However that paragraph came after
a part of the paper where they decribed running MEGAHIT on the original
unfiltered reads, so Wu et al. probably filtered out human reads before
they did the RSEM abundance assessment but not before they ran MEGAHIT.
In the set of reads that Wu et al. uploaded to the NCBI's sequence read
archive, they included all 56,565,928 reads but most human reads were
masked so that they consisted of only N bases. But some human reads were
missed by the masking procedure, which explains why the mathematician
from Hamburg got some human contigs when he ran MEGAHIT on the reads
from the SRA.</p>
<p>At time 1:49:55 in the video, Falconer said: <span class="quote">"In
their independent study, virologist Dr. Stefan Lanka and his
mathematician took the original published genomic sequence data for the
original work on coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from Fan Wu's team - remember,
based on the lung sputum fluid from a single patient in Wuhan, said to
have only an 89.1% match to a group of SARS-like beta coronaviruses
alleged to have been previously found in bats in China - and started
running this one patient's sequences in GenBank against other available
reference sequences - for not only things like bat SARS-CoV, but also
other alleged virus genomes that have nothing to do with SARS, like HIV,
hepatitis delta virus, measles virus, Zika virus, Ebola, and Marburg
virus. And lo and behold, they were able to get anywhere from 82 percent
to predominantly 96 to a 100 percent matches to all of these other
viruses from the same one patient's sample sequences, much more than Fan
Wu's 89% match to an alleged bat coronavirus."</span></p>
<p>However he mixed up two different parts of the paper, because the
table with the 96-100% matches showed the BLAST hits for the 50 longest
MEGAHIT contigs that were assembled by the mathematician from Hamburg.
Almost all of the other contigs matched parts of the human genome or
bacterial genomes, apart from one contig which matched SARS2, a few
contigs with no matches, and one contig where the best match was titled
<span class="quote">"Reagent-associated CRESS-like virus 1 isolate 7
replicase-like gene, partial sequence"</span>. But the table didn't
include HIV or hepatitis delta which were discussed in a different part
of the paper. The reason why the table includes matches for SARS2, ZC45,
and SARS1 is because it didn't just include the best match for the SARS2
contig but also matches to ZC45 and SARS1 for comparison, but from the
table below you can see that the viruses on the first 5 rows all match
the same contig:

<p>In June 2024 Mike Wallach published a Substack post about the paper
by the mathematician from Hamburg.
[<a href=https://theviraldelusion.substack.com/p/revealed-the-sars-cov-2-sequencing>https://theviraldelusion.substack.com/p/revealed-the-sars-cov-2-sequencing</a>]</p>
<p>Wallach wrote that one part of the sequencing procedure was to <span
class="quote">"Submit this mixture to a PCR process to amplify the
number of the RNA fragments, including the <span
class="quote">'amplification'</span> of any specific RNA fragments the
virologists expect to find."</span> However Wu et al. did metagenomic
sequencing where they weren't using PCR to do targeted enrichment for
any specific organism or genetic region, but they only did random
priming as part of the procedure of converting RNA to cDNA.</p>
<p>Wallach wrote: <span class="quote">"Fourth, he found that up to 17%
of the final sequence was based on RNA contigs specifically targeted and
then <span class="quote">'found'</span> by the PCR process at cycle
thresholds of ct 35 to 45, cycle counts well known in the literature to
<span class="quote">'find'</span> anything you want."</span> I believe
he referred to this sentence: <span class="quote">"While de novo
meta-transcriptomic assembly often uses no reference sequences or only
downstream reference sequences, whole genome sequencing uses a large
number of specific primer sequences, some of which already together
cover 4% to 17% of the target genome [1, 17]."</span> However the PCR
protocols he wrote about were published after Wu et al. had already done
the de-novo assembly of the genome, so it doesn't make sense to say that
the contigs Wu et al. assembled would've somehow been based on those PCR
primers. And how would you even design PCR primers if you don't first
know the sequence of the virus they're supposed to target?</p>
<p>Wallach wrote: <span class="quote">"Sixth, he found that contigs in
the remaining data sample AFTER the Fan Wu paper claims to have filtered
it for known human RNA, matched known human RNA."</span> However the
only sentence where Wu et al. wrote about filtering human reads said:
<span class="quote">"Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads), generated by
filtering host reads using the human genome (human release 32,
GRCh38.p13, downloaded from Gencode) by Bowtie2[35], were used for the
RSEM abundance assessment."</span> So Wu et al. wrote that they filtered
out human reads before they did RSEM abundance assessment, but not that
they filtered out human reads from the set of reads they uploaded to the
Sequence Read Archive. In the reads that were uploaded to the SRA, the
vast majority of human reads had been masked with N bases for privacy
reasons, but there's a small percentage of human reads that didn't get
masked.</p>

When he tried to assemble the short reads with MEGAHIT, he failed to get

and HIV-2:</p>

<p>From the table of percentages above, you can see that when
USMortality used <code>wgsim</code> to simulate short reads for the
reference genome of HKU1, his longest contig was only about 89% of the
length of the reference genome. I tried replicating his experiment so
that I used <code>wgsim</code> to generate 100,000 70-base reads for the
reference genome of HKU1. When I ran MEGAHIT to assemble the reads, I
got two different contigs, and the longer contig was only 26,533 bases
long even though the reference genome of HKU1 is 29,926 bases long:</p>

<p>When I aligned the contigs with Bowtie2, I noticed that my two
contigs covered positions 7-3108 and 3394-29927, so there was a gap of
285 bases between the contigs. But then I noticed that the gap fell
within a region where the same 30-base segment was repeated 9 times,
where there's also a few additional repeats which did not fall within
the gap between the contigs:</p>

<p>A paper about HKU1 said: <span class="quote">"Genome analysis also
revealed various numbers of tandem copies of a perfect 30-base acidic
tandem repeat (ATR) which encodes NDDEDVVTGD and various numbers and
sequences of imperfect repeats in the N terminus of nsp3 inside the
acidic domain upstream of papain-like protease 1 among the 22
genomes."</span>
[<a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16809319/>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16809319/</a>]
But <code>NDDEDVVTGD</code> is the translation of the 30-base repeated
segment:
<code>seqkit translate&lt;&lt;&lt;$'&gt;a\nAATGACGATGAAGATGTTGTTACTGGTGAC'</code>.</p>
<p>Above I ran <code>wgsim</code> using the default read length which is
70 bases, and I used paired reads instead of unpaired reads. But if
MEGAHIT would've had to assemble the contigs from unpaired reads that
each were 70 bases long, how could it know how many times the 30-base
segment was repeated if it can only see one a single 70-base window of
the genome at a time? Actually one of the main reasons why the paired
read layout is used is that it helps to assemble regions with repeats
because the read pair covers a region that is longer than an individual
read.
[<a href=https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/paired-end-vs-single-read.html>https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/paired-end-vs-single-read.html</a>]
But even though <code>wgsim</code> generated paired reads, I guess the
region with repeats was so long and the read length was so short that
the paired layout didn't help MEGAHIT to assemble the region correctly.
However I also tried using a longer read length with <code>wgsim</code>,
and I tried using a higher k-value with MEGAHIT, but neither helped with
getting a complete contig for HKU1.</p>
<p>USMortality also failed to assemble a complete contig for the
reference genome of porcine adenovirus, but that's because it contains a
tandem repeat where the same 724-base segment is repeated twice in a row
near the 3' end:</p>

<p>USMortality also failed to get complete contigs for HIV-1 and HIV-2,
but that's because HIV has a long terminal repeat where a long segment
at the 5' UTR is repeated at the 3' UTR:
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_terminal_repeat>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_terminal_repeat</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HIV-1 LTR is 634 bp[5] in length and, like other retroviral LTRs,
is segmented into the U3, R, and U5 regions. U3 and U5 has been further
subdivided according to transcription factor sites and their impact on
LTR activity and viral gene expression. The multi-step process of
reverse transcription results in the placement of two identical LTRs,
each consisting of a U3, R, and U5 region, at either end of the proviral
DNA. The ends of the LTRs subsequently participate in integration of the
provirus into the host genome. Once the provirus has been integrated,
the LTR on the 5' end serves as the promoter for the entire retroviral
genome, while the LTR at the 3' end provides for nascent viral RNA
polyadenylation and, in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, encodes the accessory
protein, Nef.[6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The long terminal repeat is 855 bases long in the reference genome of
HIV-2:</p>

<p>In order to assemble regions with repeats in MEGAHIT, it sometimes
helps to use a higher k-value, but it won't be very useful with these
huge terminal repeats in HIV since the maximum k-mer value supported by
MEGAHIT is only 255. The paper about MEGAHIT says: <span
class="quote">"While a small k-mer size is favourable for filtering
erroneous edges and filling gaps in low-coverage regions, a large k-mer
size is useful for resolving repeats."</span>

And the paper about SPAdes says: <span class="quote">"The choice of
<em>k</em> affects the construction of the de Bruijn graph. Smaller
values of k collapse more repeats together, making the graph more
<em>tangled</em>. Larger values of k may fail to detect overlaps between
reads, particularly in low coverage regions, making the graph more
<em>fragmented</em>. Since low coverage regions are typical for SCS
data, the choice of k greatly affects the quality of single-cell
assembly. Ideally, one should use smaller values of k in low-coverage
regions (to reduce fragmentation) and larger values of k in
high-coverage regions (to reduce repeat collapsing)."</span>

He then aligned the reads against the reference genome of SARS2, and he
posted the screenshots from IGV below with the description: <span
class="quote">"As you can see, the quality of these long Nanopore reads
is really terrible - so many errors and inserts! I could not find a
single read that perfectly aligns to either the head or the tail! Note,
that the highlighted letters are errors, and the purple/black areas are
inserts/deletions. Judge for yourself, but in my opinion, the amount of
errors, does not increase confidence in the genome."</span>

<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath-usmortality-3.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>The reason why the reads in his screenshots are full of N bases and
they have no T bases is that USMortality forgot to convert U bases to T
bases. And the reason why most reads appear to be full of errors is that
they are actually soft-clipped parts of reads which were shown by IGV
because he had enabled the <span class="quote">"Show soft-clipped
bases"</span> option from the <span class="quote">"Alignments"</span>
tab of the preferences. By default IGV doesn't display all letters
within reads but only letters for bases which have a mismatch from the
reference, but IGV displays all letters within soft-clipped parts of
reads which makes them look like mismatches (and the UI of IGV is a bit
confusing because there is no visual indication of which parts of reads
are soft-clipped).</p>
<p>In order to accurately gauge the number of mismatches in IGV, you
also have to uncheck <span class="quote">"Quick consensus mode"</span>
from the context menu of the alignment view, because otherwise IGV will
display mismatches as blanks unless the percentage of mismatches at the
reference position is above a given threshold.

</div>
<p>Added later: USMortality later edited the Substack post to fix his
screenshots. But he now said it was somehow problematic how a large
proportion of the reads had clipped bases at either end. But I pointed
out that chimeric reads are a well-known phenomenon, and if they would
somehow be an insurmountable problem then people could use other
sequencing methods or other library preparation methods that don't
result in chimeric reads. When I asked ChatGPT why direct RNA nanopore
sequencing would result in chimeric reads, it answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <strong>Template Switching During Reverse Transcription (if
applicable):</strong> In some workflows, RNA molecules are reverse
transcribed before sequencing. The reverse transcriptase enzyme can
occasionally switch between different RNA templates, leading to the
creation of chimeric sequences.<br> 2. <strong>RNA Fragment Annealing or
Ligation:</strong> During library preparation, RNA fragments from
different molecules may anneal or be ligated together. If these chimeric
RNA molecules are then sequenced, the resulting reads will appear as
chimeras.<br> 3. <strong>Nanopore Detection Errors:</strong> Nanopore
sequencing directly detects RNA molecules passing through a nanopore. If
two RNA molecules simultaneously enter or transiently interact within
the pore, the electrical signal may become a composite, leading to a
chimeric interpretation during basecalling.<br> 4. <strong>Molecular
Crowding or Sticky RNA Regions:</strong> RNA molecules with sticky
sequences, such as homopolymers or repetitive regions, may transiently
bind to other molecules. This interaction can result in misleading
signals interpreted as a single continuous molecule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then USMortality replied: <span class="quote">"Additionally, this
phenomenon should only occur in a subset of reads. If it is observed
consistently across all reads, it is more likely to reflect an actual
biological feature rather than an artifact, such as chimeric
reads."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1866792958478995927>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1866792958478995927</a>]</p>

ChatGPT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>inability of direct RNA sequencing (DRS) to sequence the
terminal ~12 nucleotides</strong> of RNA molecules, such as the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, stems from technical and physical limitations in the
nanopore sequencing process:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Nanopore Structure and Motor Protein Limitations:</strong>
During DRS, a motor protein unwinds and feeds the RNA strand through the
nanopore for sequencing. The motor protein must remain bound to the RNA
to control its movement. As the RNA approaches its 5' end, the motor
protein cannot maintain its grip on the molecule, leaving the terminal
nucleotides unsequenced.<br> 2. <strong>RNA Length Relative to
Adapter:</strong> The RNA molecule is attached to an adapter that
facilitates the interaction with the sequencing pore. The adapter
prevents complete threading of the RNA, leaving the last few nucleotides
unreachable by the nanopore for signal detection.<br> 3. <strong>Signal
Resolution and Decay:</strong> The electrical signal produced by the
nanopore becomes less reliable as the RNA molecule shortens, leading to
poor resolution or complete loss of signal for the terminal
nucleotides.</p>

<p>In all of the reads shown above except a single read, the match is on
the minus strand so the two extra G bases at the start of the read are
actually two extra C bases at the end of the read. So that's why you
have to trim the 3' ends of the reads in order to get rid of the extra G
bases at the start of the contig.</p>
<p>The reverse reads are sense relative to DNA and therefore antisense
relative to RNA, so they're what people might intuitively expect to be
the forward reads. The manual of the Takara RNA-Seq kit used by Wu et
al. says: <span class="quote">"For sequencing libraries produced with
this kit, Read 1 generates sequences antisense to the original RNA. This
contrasts with libraries produced by the original SMARTer Stranded Total
RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input Mammalian, for which Read 1 generates sequences
sense to the original RNA."</span>

An answer at BioStars said that the reads in the Read 1 file are called
forward reads regardless of whether they are sense or antisense relative
to the sequenced genome: <span class="quote">"For example, with Illumina
paired-end sequencing, you get two reads: commonly called <span
class="quote">'forward'</span> and <span class="quote">'reverse'</span>
reads, or even just <span class="quote">'Read 1'</span> and <span
class="quote">'Read 2'</span>. In this case, the terms <span
class="quote">'forward'</span> and <span class="quote">'reverse'</span>
refer only to the relative orientation of each read to the other, and do
not in themselves imply anything about their orientation relative to,
say, the coding strand of the original RNA molecule in an RNA-seq
experiment. When you do a strand-specific protocol, depending on the
protocol, these reads will now have an assigned strandedness relative to
the original RNA molecule. For example, a particular protocol might be
designed that the reverse read just happens to represent the actual
sequence of the RNA, while the forward read represents the
reverse-complement sequence."</span>

<a href=#Why_MEGAHIT_contigs_dont_include_the_full_33_base_poly_A_tail id=Why_MEGAHIT_contigs_dont_include_the_full_33_base_poly_A_tail>Why
MEGAHIT contigs don't include the full 33-base poly(A) tail</a>
</h3>
<p>One reason why USMortality says that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has not
been validated is that MEGAHIT contigs for Wu et al.'s raw reads don't
contain the full 33-base poly(A) tail that is included in the third
version of Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>
<p>However the full poly(A) tail is not even included in Wu et al.'s raw
reads. ChatGPT gave these reasons for why the reads might not include
the full poly(A) tail:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragmentation during Library Preparation:</strong> In
metagenomic sequencing, the RNA or DNA is typically fragmented during
the library preparation step to create a size distribution that is
suitable for sequencing. This fragmentation process can result in the
loss of the complete poly(A) tail, especially since the poly(A) tail is
a homopolymeric sequence that may be more susceptible to shearing.
[...]</li>
<li><strong>Primer Design and Amplification Bias:</strong> During
reverse transcription (for RNA viruses), primers used to convert RNA
into complementary DNA (cDNA) may not efficiently bind to the poly(A)
tail, leading to incomplete reverse transcription of the tail.
Additionally, amplification steps in library preparation can introduce
bias where certain sequences are preferentially amplified over
homopolymeric regions like poly(A) tails. [...]</li>
<li><strong>Biological Processing:</strong> In some cases, the poly(A)
tail may be naturally shortened or modified during the viral life cycle
or host processing of the viral RNA, resulting in variable lengths that
may not always be fully captured in sequencing reads.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, random priming used to convert RNA to cDNA can lead to the loss
of the full poly(A) tail in an RNA virus. Here's why this happens:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Random Primer Binding:</strong> Random primers bind to
various locations along the RNA molecule, not specifically to the
poly(A) tail. As a result, the cDNA synthesis initiated by these primers
will start at random positions along the RNA. If a primer binds upstream
of the poly(A) tail, the resulting cDNA will include only part of the
poly(A) tail or none of it, depending on where the primer binds.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Coverage:</strong> Since random priming does not
guarantee coverage of the very 3' end of the RNA where the poly(A) tail
is located, many cDNA fragments generated will not extend into the
poly(A) tail at all. This results in cDNA molecules that lack the full
poly(A) sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation and Size Selection:</strong> During library
preparation, RNA is often fragmented to create smaller pieces suitable
for sequencing. This fragmentation can occur before or after cDNA
synthesis. If fragmentation occurs before reverse transcription, the
poly(A) tail may be partially or entirely lost in the fragmentation
process. If it occurs after, the resulting cDNA fragments may include
only portions of the poly(A) tail.</li>
<li><strong>Bias Against Homopolymeric Sequences:</strong> Random
primers may have a lower efficiency in binding to and initiating cDNA
synthesis in homopolymeric regions like the poly(A) tail due to
secondary structure formation or sequence composition. This can lead to
a bias against the inclusion of the full poly(A) tail in the cDNA
library.</li>
<li><strong>Subsequent Amplification Steps:</strong> PCR amplification
of cDNA libraries can introduce biases where sequences that are easier
to amplify (non-homopolymeric regions) are preferentially amplified over
homopolymeric regions like the poly(A) tail. This can result in reduced
representation of the poly(A) tail in the final sequencing library.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a lot of variation in the length of the poly(A) tail
throughout the life cycle of a virus, so it's not reasonable to require
that the poly(A) tail should always be precisely 33 bases long:
[<a href=https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2820%2930406-2>https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2820%2930406-2</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently developed software to measure the length of poly(A) tail
from DRS data (Y. Choi and H.C., unpublished data). Using this software,
we confirm that, like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs carry poly(A) tails
(Figures 4A-4B). The tail of viral RNAs is 47 nt in median length. The
full-length gRNA has a relatively longer tail than sgRNAs. Notably,
sgRNAs have two tail populations: a minor peak at ∼30 nt and a major
peak at ∼45 nt (Figure 4B, arrowheads). Wu et al., 2013 previously
observed that the poly(A) tail length of bovine CoV mRNAs changes during
infection: from ∼45 nt immediately after virus entry to ∼65 nt at 6-9
hours post-infection and ∼30 nt at 120-144 hours post-infection. Thus,
the short tails of ∼30 nt observed in this study may represent aged RNAs
that are prone to decay.</p>

of extra 3-5 bases at the ends of reads</a>
</h3>
<p>One reason why USMortality says that the genome has not been
validated is because when he aligns Wu et al.'s reads against
Wuhan-Hu-1, he cannot find any read which has a perfect match to the 5'
end, but there's always 3-5 extra bases at the start of reads that don't
match Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>
<p>McKernan explained the purpose of the bases in this tweet:
[<a href=https://x.com/Kevin_McKernan/status/1674577464184512513>https://x.com/Kevin_McKernan/status/1674577464184512513</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what random priming means? It means the hexamer that
primes the second strand synthesis, is 5'-NNNNNN-3OH. The kit uses a
strand flipping enzyme which adds bases on the watson strand of the 5'
end. These become adaptors.</p>

<p>McKernan's screenshots are from the manual of the Takara SMARTer
Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v.2 that was used by Wu et
al. [<a href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User+Manual/SMARTer+Stranded+Total+RNA/SMARTer+Stranded+Total+RNA-Seq+Kit+v2+-+Pico+Input+Mammalian+User+Manual_050619.pdf>https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User+Manual/SMARTer+Stranded+Total+RNA/SMARTer+Stranded+Total+RNA-Seq+Kit+v2+-+Pico+Input+Mammalian+User+Manual_050619.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>Actually the 5' template switching oligo is the key feature of the
SMART method developed by Takara (and it's even where the name SMART
comes from):

<div>
<img src=i/hamburgmath-smart.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT <span class="quote">"are template switching
bases that end with ggg part of adapter or not"</span>, it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Template switching bases that end with <span
class="quote">"GGG"</span> are typically part of the template-switching
oligonucleotide (TSO), not the adapter.</p>
<p>In template switching, an enzyme like reverse transcriptase adds
several nucleotides to the 3' end of the cDNA, typically consisting of
cytosines (CCC). The TSO, which usually contains a sequence starting
with <span class="quote">"GGG,"</span> hybridizes to these cytosines,
allowing the enzyme to continue synthesizing the cDNA. This <span
class="quote">"GGG"</span> sequence is a crucial component of the TSO
and not part of the adapter sequence.</p>
<p>The adapter sequence, on the other hand, is usually added during a
later stage of library preparation and is used for subsequent PCR
amplification and sequencing. The adapter does not typically include the
<span class="quote">"GGG"</span> sequence used for template
switching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't sure what the difference between nontemplated bases and the
G bases was, and I wasn't sure if the G bases are part of the TSO or
not. But ChatGPT answered that the G bases are part of the TSO but the
term <span class="quote">"nontemplated bases"</span> refers to the C
bases that are added by reverse transcriptase and not to the G bases in
the TSO:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Non-Templated Bases</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>During reverse transcription, the reverse transcriptase enzyme
sometimes adds a few non-templated cytosine bases (<span
class="quote">"C"</span>) at the 3' end of the newly synthesized cDNA.
This addition is a key part of the template-switching process.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Template-Switching Oligonucleotide (TSO)</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The TSO is a short synthetic sequence that contains a few guanine
bases (<span class="quote">"G"</span>) at its 3' end. The <span
class="quote">"G"</span> bases in the TSO are designed to pair with the
non-templated <span class="quote">"C"</span> bases added to the
cDNA.</li>
<li>Once the non-templated <span class="quote">"C"</span> bases are
added to the cDNA, the TSO anneals to these bases, allowing the reverse
transcriptase to continue copying the TSO sequence into the cDNA.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Sequence Incorporation</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The non-templated <span class="quote">"C"</span> bases and the
complementary <span class="quote">"G"</span> bases from the TSO are
incorporated into the final cDNA product. As a result, the beginning of
your cDNA (and subsequently your sequencing reads) will contain the TSO
sequence, often preceded by these non-templated bases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT how I can trim TSO sequences from the start of
reads that consist of up to 5 bases and that usually end in a G base, it
told me to use <code>fastp --trim_front1=5</code> (which is exactly what
I did to get rid of the two extra G bases at the start of my MEGAHIT
contig, even though I also trimmed 5 bases from the back end of reverse
reads).</p>
<p>Added in February 2025: USMortality tweeted: <span class="quote">"You
know why McKernan's adapter theory is probably also false?! Because why
would this only occur at the ends? If it were true that there are still
technical sequences at the ends of the reads, this should apply to all
reads, implying that we should observe similar mismatches everywhere
else, not only at the ends."</span>

But I think it does also occur elsewhere. If you do local alignment and
you keep only reads with soft-clipped bases at the start, the segment of
soft-clipped bases often ends with one or more G bases like here (where
the first column shows the starting position, and in the second column
for example <code>2S149M</code> means that there are 2 bases at the
start that were clipped by the local alignment):</p>

<p>In August 2024 USMortality received this response to a FOIA request
(the ellipses are part of the original post):
[<a href=https://www.usmortality.com/p/an-official-cdc-foia-response-confirms>https://www.usmortality.com/p/an-official-cdc-foia-response-confirms</a>]</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to the first point, single-virion sequencing is difficult
to perform for RNA viruses according to a paper from 2020 titled <span
class="quote">"Single-virus genomics and beyond"</span>:
[<a href=https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/110342/5/Martinez-Martinez_etal_2020_NatRevMicrobiol_accepted.pdf>https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/110342/5/Martinez-Martinez_etal_2020_NatRevMicrobiol_accepted.pdf</a>,

<blockquote>
<p>However, SVG has its own biases and technical challenges. For
example, the detection of viruses with very small capsid size and/or
ssDNA and RNA genomes is virtually impossible with current flow
cytometers, which are mostly designed for targeting cells instead of
nanoparticles. The low fluorescence derived from the staining of ssDNA
and RNA viral genomes with commercially available dyes and their low
side and forward scatter signals are below detection limit or overlap
with background signal and electronic noise. The development of flow
cytometry instruments that can detect very small, low-fluorescence
particles would help pushing the boundaries of SVG to capture hidden
viral diversity. Other strategies for virus detection and sorting based
on microfluidic nano-devices and lab-on a chip with optics integration
are becoming very attractive alternatives to flow cytometry. Despite the
well-established protocols for detecting and targeting dsDNA viruses
using fluorescent nucleic acid-binding stains, to the best of our
knowledge, current commercial dyes with high affinity for ssDNA and RNA
do not fully discriminate against dsDNA, further complicating the
distinction of ssDNA and RNA containing particles. Furthermore, although
Phi29 DNA polymerase and variations of it can amplify DNA, we are not
aware of a commercially available enzyme with the required sensitivity
for whole genome amplification (WGA) of a single copy of a RNA virus
genome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to the second point, even though there wouldn't be a
sequencing run where the entire genome had been sequenced in a single
read, there are direct RNA nanopore sequencing runs which contain reads
that are over 10,000 bases long, like for example SRR11300652 which I
described in an earlier section. And even in the case that someone
would've managed to sequence nearly the entire genome in a single read,
the CDC wouldn't necessarily have any records relating to the study if
the study wasn't performed by the CDC.</p>
<p>In response to the third point, in previous sections of this file I
have explained why MEGAHIT contigs don't include the full 33-base
poly(A) tail and why they sometimes include one or two extra G bases of
the 5' end.</p>
<p>The CDC responded to the 4th point by saying that they haven't used
5' RACE to sequence SARS-CoV-2. However there are many other
institutions that have used 5' RACE to sequence SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>USMortality claimed that the FOIA response <span
class="quote">"confirms that the validation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has
not been completed to scientific standards"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1825961166667133203>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1825961166667133203</a>]
However the validation of the genome is not a scientific concept but
it's a concept that was invented by USMortality. For example one of his
criteria for establishing the validity of the genome is valid is that he
finds ten or more sequencing reads which match the 5' end of the genome
perfectly so that no bases have to be trimmed from the ends of the
reads. But I don't know any scientific source which has proposed similar
criteria for validating the genome of a virus. And single-virion
sequencing is a rare technique which currently seems to be difficult or
impossible to perform for RNA viruses, so few actual virologists would
probably agree that it's necessary to perform single-virion sequencing
of SARS-CoV-2 in order to validate the genome to <span
class="quote">"scientific standards"</span> (which are in fact not
scientific standards but standards that were invented by
USMortality).</p>
<p>Added in January 2025: USMortality also sent a similar request to the
Robert Koch Institute which is the German equivalent of the CDC, but he
received the following response which explained that his questions were
stupid:

<blockquote>
<p>However, the NGS techniques involve a significant burden for sample
preparation. Since to generate complete viral genome coverage, genomic
nucleic acid enrichment is required by reverse transcription PCR using
virus-specific primers or by viral particle concentration. Furthermore,
conventional NGS techniques cannot determine the 5' and 3' terminal
sequences of the RNA viral genome. Therefore, the terminal sequences are
determined one by one using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).
However, since some RNA viruses have segmented genomes, the burden of
the determination using RACE is proportional to the number of segments.
To date, there is only one study attempting whole genome sequencing of
multiple RNA viruses without using above mentioned methods, but the
generated sequences' accuracy compared to the reference sequences was up
to 97% and did not reach 100% due to the low read depth. Hence, we
established novel methods, named PCR-NGS and RCA-NGS, that were
optimized for an NGS machine, MinION. These methods do not require
nucleic acid amplification with virus-specific PCR primers, physical
viral particle enrichment, and RACE. These methods enable whole RNA
viral genome sequencing by combining the following techniques: (1)
removal of unwanted DNA and RNA other than the RNA viral genome by
nuclease treatment; (2) the terminal of viral genome sequence
determination by barcoded linkers ligation; (3) amplification of the
viral genomic cDNA using ligated linker sequences-specific PCR or an
isothermal DNA amplification technique, such as rolling circle
amplification (RCA). The established method was evaluated using isolated
RNA viruses with single-stranded, double-stranded, positive-stranded,
negative-stranded, non-segmented or multi-segmented genomes. As a
result, all the viral genome sequences could be determined with 100%
accuracy, and these mean read depths were greater than 2,500×, at least
using either of the methods.</p>

<p>When I tried aligning the reads for SARS-CoV-2 from the paper against
Wuhan-Hu-1, the reads with starting position 1 all included a sequence
of about 100 bases before the actual read. The sequence generally seem
to end with 2 to 5 <code>G</code> bases similar to Wu et al.'s reads,
which are part of the template switching oligo which anneals to the
complementary untemplated C bases that are added by reverse
transcriptase:</p>

<p>The reads also end with a sequence that is about 100 bases long,
where based on the figure in the screenshot above I guess the first part
consists of a PCR primer and the second part consist of an adapter. The
poly(A) tail seems to be about 10-20 bases long in most reads:</p>

<p>In the approximately 100-base sequences at the start and end of
reads, the outer half seems to be more variable but the inner half is
more constant, but it might just be if base calling errors are more
common at the ends of reads, because there is low average quality in
approximately the first 50 and last 50 bases of the reads:</p>

<p>Based on this figure from the Japanese paper, the inner half of the
5' end seems to correspond to the brown segment (strand switching
primer) and the outer half seems to correspond to the light purple
segment (adapter):</p>

<p>The longest read that aligned against Wuhan-Hu-1 was 8,454 bases
long, but the first 111 and last 52 bases were clipped by BLAST. It has
only about 90% identity to Wuhan-Hu-1, but a 10% error rate is typical
for the ONT MinION sequencer which was used in the study:</p>
