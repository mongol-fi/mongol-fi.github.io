<p>Matt Hancock served as the UK Secretary of State for Health and
Social Care from 2018 until 2021. In 2023 over of his 100,000 WhatsApp
messages were shared in a release that were called the <span
class="quote">"lockdown files"</span>. In WhatsApp messages that were
sent on December 13th 2020 UTC, Hancock told his media and PR advisor
Damon Poole <span class="quote">"We frighten the pants of everyone with
the new strain"</span>, and Hancock asked <span class="quote">"When do
we deploy the new variant"</span>:

<p>People have interpreted Hancock's message to mean that they would've
deliberately released a new strain of COVID. However I believe by
deploying the new variant, he meant releasing the news story about Alpha
to the media.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock then replied: <span class="quote">"We frighten the pants

<p>The discussion came two days after Mr Hancock was informed of the
emergence of a variant - known as Alpha or the Kent variant, in December
2020.</p>

<p>An article by Sky News said:

<p>Matt Hancock told aides he wanted to <span class="quote">"frighten

restrictions.</p>
<p>That is the latest revelation from more than 100,000 WhatsApp
messages leaked to the Telegraph by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was
given them by the former health secretary while they were collaborating
on his memoir.</p>
<p>The messages show Mr Hancock and others discussed how to use the Kent
variant of the virus to scare the public so they would obey the
rules.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><span class="quote">"When do we deploy the new variant?"</span> Mr
Hancock said.</p>
<p>The new variant was publicly identified on 14 December and five days
later Boris Johnson announced that families would no longer be able to

about Alpha in December 2020</a>
</h2>
<p>On December 14th UTC which was the day after Hancock sent the
Whatsapp messages, he talked to the UK parliament about the Alpha
strain: <span class="quote">"I'd like to update the house on a new
development about the virus itself. Over the last few days, thanks to
our world-class genomic capability in the UK, we have identified a new
variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the faster spread
in the southeast of England. Initial analysis suggests that this variant
is growing faster than the existing variants. We've currently identified
over a thousand cases with this variant - predominantly in the South of
England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different
local authority areas, and numbers are increasing rapidly."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaHCQD157aQ&t=2m11s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaHCQD157aQ&amp;t=2m11s</a>]</p>
<p>On December 19th UTC, Hancock posted a tweet where he used the phrase
<span class="quote">"the new variant"</span> to refer to Alpha:
[<a href=https://x.com/MattHancock/status/1340332784934641665>https://x.com/MattHancock/status/1340332784934641665</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific evidence on the new variant of #coronavirus is
sobering.</p>
<p>If you are in Tier 4, from tomorrow you must stay at home to protect
the NHS &amp; save lives.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone playing their part in the national effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On December 20th UTC, Daily Mail published an article about Alpha
titled <span class="quote">"Matt Hancock warns mutant Covid strain is
<span class="quote">'out of control'</span>"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9072291/Tory-MPs-demand-clear-exit-strategy-nightmarish-cycle-lockdowns.html>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9072291/Tory-MPs-demand-clear-exit-strategy-nightmarish-cycle-lockdowns.html</a>]
The same day BBC also published an article about Alpha titled <span
class="quote">"Covid: WHO in <span class="quote">'close contact'</span>
with UK over new virus variant"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55382212>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55382212</a>]</p>
<p>More widespread coverage about Alpha in the media started on December
22nd UTC, when BBC published an article titled <span
class="quote">"Covid: New variant found <span class="quote">'due to hard
work of UK scientists'</span>"</span> and The Guardian published an
article titled <span class="quote">"Here's what we know about the new
variant of coronavirus"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666</a>,
<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-variant-coronavirus-genomic-sars-cov-2-pandemic>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-variant-coronavirus-genomic-sars-cov-2-pandemic</a>]</p>
<p>The term Alpha wasn't introduced until May 2021. The article by The
Guardian referred to the variant as <span class="quote">"1.1.7"</span>
(which was the Pango designation B.1.1.7 without the B), but the
articles by the BBC and Daily Mail didn't refer to it using any specific
term but they just called it <span class="quote">"the new
variant"</span> like Hancock.</p>
<p>There's only a few tweets which match the term <code>B.1.1.7</code>
until December 20th UTC, when several people posted a link to a report
about Alpha that had been posted on the Virological forum on December
18th UTC.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22B.1.1.7%22+until%3A2020-12-20&src=typed_query&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22B.1.1.7%22+until%3A2020-12-20&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a>,
<a href=https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563>https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563</a>]</p>
<p>The first tweet which matched the phrase <span class="quote">"Kent
variant"</span> was posted on December 19th UTC.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22kent%20variant%22%20until%3A2020-12-20&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22kent%20variant%22%20until%3A2020-12-20&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>So at the time when Hancock sent the WhatsApp messages, terms like
<span class="quote">"B.1.1.7"</span> or <span class="quote">"Kent
variant"</span> were not yet widely known so it made sense for him to
just refer to Alpha as <span class="quote">"the new variant"</span>. At
the time Alpha was the main emerging variant in the UK that people were
concerned about, so it wouldn't have been ambiguous which variant he
meant.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Who_is_Damon_Poole id=Who_is_Damon_Poole>Who is Damon
Poole?</a>
</h2>
<p>In an appendix which describes the people featured in Hancock's book,
there's this entry for Damon Poole: <span class="quote">"Replaced Jamie
Njoku-Goodwin as media special adviser in October 2020. Previously head
of broadcast for No. 10. Trusted by all, soon established himself as
sage adviser on all communications and media relations."</span></p>
<p>On a list of the top 50 special political advisors in the UK, Damon
Poole was listed on rank 35: <span class="quote">"Another former Vote
Leaver, <span class="quote">'Damo'</span> Poole was very close to
Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain and was sent by the latter to Health to be
Matt Hancock's media Spad after the departure of the well-regarded Jamie
Njoku-Goodwin. A street fighter like his mentor Cain, Poole was head of
research at Change Britain, a pressure group set up by prominent Vote
Leave members, and was head of broadcasting at Number Ten during
numerous boycotts of programmes including Today and Good Morning
Britain. The rugby-mad Spad is also a former account director at
Brunswick public affairs firm."</span>
[<a href=https://macemagazine.com/spads/damon-poole/>https://macemagazine.com/spads/damon-poole/</a>]</p>
<p>So would Hancock's PR and media advisor have high enough clearance to
know about top-secret bioweapon deployment plans?</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Usage_of_the_word_deploy id=Usage_of_the_word_deploy>Usage of
the word deploy</a>
</h2>
<p>In web development, deploying a website means publishing it from a
local development environment to a production environment where it is
available to its users, so in that context the term <span
class="quote">"deploy"</span> a has a similar meaning as the word <span
class="quote">"publish"</span>.</p>
<p>Hancock seems to be familiar with the usage of the word <span
class="quote">"deploy"</span> in software development, because his book
has one paragraph where he speaks about deploying an application to the
App Store: <span class="quote">"In other news, we've finally abandoned
the in-house version of the contact tracing app. <span
class="quote">'Dido is putting it to sleep. And moving on. Probably
quite right,'</span> Jim told me gruffly. He's worried about how we
explain it. The app developers have built a perfectly good system that
works - but Apple won't let us deploy it because they don't want us
using the data in the NHS to identify contacts and save
lives."</span></p>
<p>In the context of deploying military troops to a foreign country, the
word <span class="quote">"deploy"</span> has a similar meaning as the
phrase <span class="quote">"send out"</span>, and you might also say
that military troops are sent out to a foreign country. However in the
same way Hancock might have meant that they would send out the story
about Alpha to the media.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Meaning_of_the_terms_roll_the_pitch_and_forward_signaling id=Meaning_of_the_terms_roll_the_pitch_and_forward_signaling>Meaning
of the terms roll the pitch and forward signaling</a>
</h2>
<p>Damon Poole wrote: <span class="quote">"Rather than doing too much
forward signalling, we can roll pitch with the new strain"</span>. I
wasn't sure what <span class="quote">"to roll pitch"</span> meant at
first, but Google Gemini said: <span class="quote">"In a more figurative
sense, <span class="quote">'to roll the pitch'</span> means to prepare
people for an upcoming change, especially if it's likely to be
unpopular. It's like softening the ground (the pitch) before delivering
the news. This usage is more common in British English."</span> Gemini
also said: <span class="quote">"Imagine a cricket pitch (the playing
surface) that needs to be flattened and prepared before the game.
Similarly, <span class="quote">'rolling the pitch'</span> signifies
getting everyone ready for the new situation."</span></p>
<p>When I ChatGPT what the term <span class="quote">"forward
signaling"</span> meant, it answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of the conversation in your image, <span
class="quote">"forward signalling"</span> likely refers to sending out
signals or hints about future plans, policies, or actions before they
are officially decided or implemented. It involves giving an indication
of what might come, which can influence behavior or decisions even
before a formal announcement.</p>
<p>In this instance, the participants seem to be discussing the
messaging strategy around a new COVID-19 strain. <span
class="quote">"Forward signalling"</span> might mean giving people an
early indication that stricter measures might be coming due to the new
strain. However, they are suggesting caution with how much information
they share too early, to avoid unnecessary panic or political
fallout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Hancock talked about frightening <span class="quote">"the pants
off everyone with the new strain"</span>, the frightening he referred to
seems to have been a function of the media. And in the same way the
terms <span class="quote">"to roll the pitch"</span> and <span
class="quote">"forward signaling"</span> both seem to refer to the
strategy of communicating about COVID that Hancock and Poole were going
to relay to the media.</p>
<p>Damon Poole was Hancock's media advisor, so if you search for his
name in Hancock's book, you'll see that he is often discussing topics
related to the media with Hancock.</p>

<p>According to Matt Hancock's book <span class="quote">"Pandemic
Diaries"</span>, he was first informed about Alpha on December 11th, he
called Boris Johnson about Alpha on December 12th, and he talked to the
UK parliament about Alpha on December 14th:
[<a href=https://libgen.rocks/index.php?req=pandemic+diaries+matt+hancock>https://libgen.rocks/index.php?req=pandemic+diaries+matt+hancock</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="friday-11-december">FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER</h3>
<p>Fridays are typically quieter in Westminster, so I took the
opportunity to film a series of Christmas and New Year messages for the
department with Lauren from the parliamentary team. Midway through this
cheerful exercise, I was interrupted by a phone call from JVT.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'I think I know what the problem is in
Kent,'</span> he said bluntly. <span class="quote">'I need to come and
see you about it. Genomic testing has found a new variant. It must be
spreading much faster. It's obviously now across Kent, Essex and
London.'</span></p>
<p>For the second time in three days, my stomach lurched. At least this
explained why the Kent numbers had been so stubbornly high.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'This is a disaster,'</span> I replied. I fired
questions at him: How much do we know? When did it first appear? Will
the vaccine still work? If the November lockdown couldn't keep it down,
what will?</p>
<p><span class="quote">'I don't know,'</span> JVT replied honestly. He
asked me to give him the evening to find out more. Taking a deep breath,
I asked Natasha to fix a Zoom for early tomorrow afternoon and tried to
return to my task. It was impossible. Trying to create upbeat, grateful
Christmas messages when I now knew there was no chance of a normal
Christmas felt almost insulting. I attempted to keep recording, but my
heart wasn't in it. Later the team told me the footage was unusable -
apparently the news was written all over my face. I couldn't hide my
disappointment.</p>
<p>The new variant reinforced my determination to derail a Department
for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs proposal that would allow
seasonal workers from eastern Europe to continue coming here to work on
farms. It is complete madness, especially given the mink scenario.
Seriously, why don't they just hire local people and pay them more? The
clinical advice is that letting in so many foreign labourers could set
our vaccine programme back six months. DEFRA duly fell into line.</p>
<p>On my recommendation, Jim Bethell has been talking to George Osborne
about how to make a success of the G7 summit when we host it next year.
George's advice is to keep the agenda tight and pay proper attention to
the atmospherics: choose a good venue like a country house hotel; make
sure bits of the summit are held somewhere with a cool vibe; and don't
forget to give them all a gift. The Germans once gave me a whole
dark-chocolate Brandenburg Gate; the French, something from Hermès. Last
time we hosted, we gave the leaders Burberry scarves.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'Perfect,'</span> I replied. <span
class="quote">'Let's make the focus <span class="quote">"protect the
west from the next pandemic"</span>.'</span></p>
<p>Later Jamie alerted me to an article in the i newspaper by Stephen
Bush saying my approach to the pandemic has been vindicated while the
Chancellor <span class="quote">'called the whole thing dead
wrong'</span>. Nice for me, but a bit harsh on Rishi. Jamie may have
left, but he's still looking out for me and asked how my relationship
with Rishi is doing, to which I replied - truthfully - that it's in a
great place.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'Make sure you're being as nice and supportive as
you can to him, even if HMT are being twats,'</span> he replied. Good
advice. While Rishi and I haven't always agreed, he has done a terrific
job protecting the economy.</p>
<p>Finally, a text from Damon, informing me that someone spotted me at
the Four Seasons Hotel and has told the media that I was quaffing
champagne.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'Am I OK to say you didn't buy champagne? The
idiot is saying it cost £3.5k,'</span> Damon asked.</p>
<p>Er, yes. I would never spend £3.5k, or even a fraction of £3.5k, on
champagne, and I am certainly not feeling remotely celebratory.</p>
<h3 id="saturday-12-december">SATURDAY 12 DECEMBER</h3>
<p>The whole Christmas plan is disintegrating.</p>
<p>I woke up to hear Professor Linda Bauld, an expert in public health
at the University of Edinburgh, labelling the proposed relaxation a
<span class="quote">'mistake'</span> because people will travel from
high- to low-prevalence areas to see relatives. Later Vaughan Gething
chimed in to suggest that if cases remain high, we may have to change
tack - blowing apart the UK-wide consensus. And this is before we go
public about the new variant.</p>
<p>At 2.30 p.m. I logged onto the Zoom with JVT. It turns out that PHE
has been tracking the new variant for some time - as they do with many
others - but were not seriously worried until they put two and two
together with the cases rocketing in Kent. It now accounts for almost
all new infections in the area. There's a possibility it started in
France, but that's now irrelevant. The Prof thinks it's unlikely to be
any more deadly but it may well be more transmissible.</p>
<p>With a sinking feeling, I told the others that we must publish the
details and inform the WHO. I know there will be huge consequences: just
look what the mink variant did to Denmark, and what has happened to
South Africa, where a new variant was detected in October. Macron now
has every excuse to close the border at Calais, and the rest of the EU
will swiftly follow. If the new variant evades the vaccine, we are all
well and truly stuffed.</p>
<p>These formalities agreed, I called Boris, who was surprisingly
sanguine. He seemed somehow resigned to the misery we will have to
inflict on everyone.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'It's going to make Christmas very
difficult,'</span> I said.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'Christmas was already going to be very
difficult,'</span> he replied philosophically.</p>
<p>Later a GP friend got in touch to tell me that younger care home
workers are reluctant to have the vaccine. Understandably, operators are
worried about their legal position. What if an unvaccinated carer brings
Covid into a home and infects a resident? Could the company be held
liable? I messaged Nadhim, saying we needed to discuss. <span
class="quote">'Clearly we can't mandate,'</span> he replied, meaning: we
can't force care workers to have the jab.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure. If you want to work with the most vulnerable people
in our society, surely you have a duty to be vaccinated? This is why the
hepatitis B vaccination is already mandatory for doctors. People will
have strong views on both sides, but I know where I stand.</p>
<p>Separately, I asked Nadhim if he thinks we made the right call when
we said we won't pile vaccines into Covid hotspots. It's been bothering
me.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'Yes, because of the fairness argument,'</span>
he replied, adding that if we'd approached this geographically, great
swathes of the country would be left without any vaccine at all.</p>
<h3 id="sunday-13-december">SUNDAY 13 DECEMBER</h3>
<p>All hell is breaking loose over Christmas. Damon says Tory MPs are
<span class="quote">'already furious'</span> at the prospect that
everything will be cancelled. Pretty much everyone else is saying it
would be insane to press on as planned. According to Helen Whately, the
situation in Kent hospitals is dire and it's not at all clear how they
will cope over the next few weeks, even without the Christmas
easements.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'I don't see how we can have them,'</span> is her
gloomy verdict.</p>
<p>Ever eager to throw in his tuppenny worth, Chris Hopson of NHS
Providers publicly appealed to us to <span class="quote">'think really
carefully'</span> about the festive season, which is his way of
signalling that he'll be on the radio every single day complaining about
how awful everything is unless we change course.</p>
<p>I asked the Prof whether he thinks there is any way we can stick to
the original plan. Basically, no.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'The problem is that we'd be taking a risk from
an already very high base,'</span> he said.</p>
<p>If we have to U-turn, hopefully the Kent variant will reduce the
backlash. His worry is that if there is any suggestion the vaccine
doesn't work for the new strain, the right-wing press will start arguing
that we should just let the virus rip.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'That's why we reassure on the vaccine,'</span> I
replied. There's no evidence the vaccine doesn't work.</p>
<p>Susan Hopkins at PHE is tearing her hair out that they didn't pick up
the clusters earlier, given they have known about the new variant since
20 September, though to be fair to them, they could not have known back
then how significant it would become.</p>
<p>The good news is that the vaccine rollout is going from strength to
strength. I think we might be able to jab as many as 2 million people by
Christmas. When I publicly suggested as much, Simon Stevens kicked off.
In a patronising message to Damon, he sniffed that there is <span
class="quote">'no version of reality'</span> whereby <span
class="quote">'several million people will receive the vaccine before
Christmas'</span>, saying that whoever put this about (i.e. me) <span
class="quote">'might want to urgently undertake some course correction
before that inevitably becomes clear'</span>. According to Damon, NHS
England now want to <span class="quote">'distance themselves a
bit'</span> from the <span class="quote">'millions line'</span>. Very
bad idea.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'We must NOT look like there's any
separation,'</span> I said firmly. I can just see the <span
class="quote">'government split'</span> headlines. I may have not stuck
to my own adage about under-promising and over-delivering - Simon's got
a point - but it's for me to clear this up, not for NHS England to brief
against.</p>
<p>I'm doing the morning media round tomorrow and asked Nadhim his
advice. <span class="quote">'Do you need to say a number?'</span> he
asked, adding that we've done 100,000 so far.</p>
<p><span class="quote">'I don't need to, but I've got so much shit to
shovel it would be nice to have some cheer too,'</span> I replied.</p>
<p>His response was three heart emojis and a bunch of praise. <span
class="quote">'This job would have burned out the best of us,'</span> he
said, kindly.</p>
<h3 id="monday-14-december">MONDAY 14 DECEMBER</h3>
<p>Amazingly, this morning I managed to row back from my 2 million
comment without any fuss. Another minor screw-up sorted. At least it was
only on the comms.</p>
<p>Then later I announced the new variant in a statement to Parliament.
The reaction wasn't as sensible as I'd hoped: even normally reasonable
MPs like Greg Clark and Damian Green are going tonto. Everyone can see
Christmas falling apart, and judgement is going out of the window. In a
sign of Downing Street nerves, Michael Gove summoned me to the Cabinet
Office to ask whether we can go any faster with the jab. Er, no. We're
already going all out. I've already answered these <span
class="quote">'daft laddie'</span> questions. The pressure to accelerate
is immense. The next few days are going to be very rough.</p>

<p>In the entry for December 13th above, Hancock even referred to the
Alpha variant in connection to Poole's WhatsApp message about letting
the virus rip: <span class="quote">"If we have to U-turn, hopefully the
Kent variant will reduce the backlash. His worry is that if there is any
suggestion the vaccine doesn't work for the new strain, the right-wing
press will start arguing that we should just let the virus
rip."</span></p>
<p>The introduction to Hancock's book says that the book was written in
the form of diary, but that the entries for each day were written
retrospectively and not on the day when they happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Written as a diary, sometimes hour by hour but mostly day by day, it
charts the key events and how I felt about them at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn't have time to keep a detailed diary in the midst
of the maelstrom, nor would it have been right to do so. For the best
part of eighteen months, I spent almost every waking hour managing our
response, alongside the many amazing healthcare professionals, carers,
public servants and other key workers who did so much to save lives and
keep the country going.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The account that follows has been meticulously pieced together from
my formal papers held by the department; contemporaneous notes and voice
memos; my communications with ministerial colleagues; interviews with
many of the participants and myriad other emails and messages that
record what happened and why particular decisions were taken.</p>
