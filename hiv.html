<h2>
<a href=#Nick_the_Spacecats_visna_recombination_theory id=Nick_the_Spacecats_visna_recombination_theory>Nick
the Spacecat's visna recombination theory</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick the Rainbow Spacecat claims that HIV is the product of
recombination between the simian immunodeficiency virus and the
visna-maedi virus.</p>
<p>He said that <span class="quote">"I've seen there are 12 genes in HIV
from Visna"</span>, even though HIV doesn't even have 12 genes:
[<a href=https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>pizzapicklespur/<wbr>status/<wbr>1835335880049037801</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-3.webp width=592>
</div>
<p>In the thread below I asked Nick which part of the genome of HIV was
taken from visna, but he was not able to answer my question:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1874240728853078195</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-4.webp width=592>
</div>
<p>Here I again showed him similarity plots which demonstrate why his
Visna recombination theory didn't make sense:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1880786821292101754</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-1.webp width=592>
</div>
<p>A month later, Nick again tweeted about the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, so I pointed out to him again that the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium formation, where
visna triggered host cells to merge into cells with multiple nuclei:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1889686323109277853</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-2.webp width=592>
</div>
<p>He eventually blocked me because of these tweets:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>henjin256/<wbr>status/<wbr>1903818908898857222</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-5.webp width=591>
</div>
<p>In March 2025, Nick hosted a video roundtable, which featured
presentations by himself, Adam Finnegan, Charles Rixey, and Aaron
Baalbergen. During his presentation, Nick showed the graphic below,
where he suggested that HIV was a recombinant of visna and SIV, and he
said: <span class="quote">"And then they'd get a whole brady bunch of
different chimeras or hybrids. This is my very crude scientific
rendering of that process building HIV - and today's presentation is not
about the details of this - but <span class="quote">'viral
fusion'</span> are the keywords that you want to use if you'd like to
search more about this process."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v6qu21c-<wbr>2025-<wbr>spring-<wbr>roundtable.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=3974</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-1.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>Then he showed a screenshot of the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, and he said <span class="quote">"Here, in my opinion, is
the final step that created HIV, and that would be fusing this, a sheep
virus with that STLV we mentioned before."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-2.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>At that point I had already told Nick multiple times that the paper
had nothing to do with the genomic recombination of visna and HIV, and
the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium
formation and not recombination. So I told him on Kevin McCairn's
Discord that he seems to be deliberately producing disinformation,
because he should've realized himself that the paper had nothing to do
with his visna recombination theory. And I posted even more evidence on
the Discord that showed why his theory didn't make sense.</p>
<p>However even after that, Nick has kept posting screenshots of the
paper on Twitter:

<hr />
<p>In a video with Kevin McCairn, Nick said: <span class="quote">"They
called the whole general body of science recombinant DNA. And the
specific area - that I believe created HIV - they referred to as
fusogenics, or fusion products."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v70qy3w-ai-scientific-tyranny-enforced-through-reliance-on-fraudulent-data.html?start=3285>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v70qy3w-<wbr>ai-<wbr>scientific-<wbr>tyranny-<wbr>enforced-<wbr>through-<wbr>reliance-<wbr>on-<wbr>fraudulent-<wbr>data.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=3285</a>]
However neither of the terms <span class="quote">"fusogenics"</span> or
<span class="quote">"fusion products"</span> refers to genomic
recombination of two species of viruses.</p>
<p>ChatGPT said: <span class="quote">"Fusogenics refers to the
scientific study of the mechanisms and applications of membrane fusion,
a fundamental biological process in which two separate lipid membranes
merge into one continuous bilayer. This field investigates how fusogenic
proteins, lipids, or synthetic agents initiate and control fusion events
at the molecular level. In virology, fusogenics focuses on understanding
how viruses such as HIV or influenza use specialized envelope proteins
to fuse with host cells and deliver their genetic material."</span></p>
<p>And ChatGPT said: <span class="quote">"In the context of HIV biology,
the term fusion product most commonly refers to the molecular or
cellular outcome of the viral fusion process that enables the virus to
enter host cells. HIV relies on its envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and
gp41, to mediate fusion with the membrane of a CD4+ target cell. After
gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4), gp41
undergoes conformational changes that bring the viral and cellular
membranes into close proximity, leading to their merger. The resulting
fusion product is the fused membrane complex, which permits the viral
core to enter the host cytoplasm."</span></p>
<h2>
<a href=#Origin_of_the_visna_recombination_theory id=Origin_of_the_visna_recombination_theory>Origin
of the visna recombination theory</a>
</h2>
<p>A variant of Nick's theory that HIV is a recombinant of visna and
some other virus had earlier been presented by his mentor Alan Cantwell.
Cantwell in turn appears to have copied the theory from the Strecker
brothers, who had presented it by March 1986 or earlier. Other variants
of the visna recombination theory had been presented by John Seale by
December 1985 or earlier, and by Jakob Segal by May 1986 or earlier.
However I'm not sure if the Strecker brothers, Segal, or Seale came up
with the theory first.</p>
<p>John Seale initially suggested that HIV was manufactured by adding an
extra gene to the visna virus without specifying where the extra gene
came from, but later he said that HIV was a recombinant of visna and
bovine leukemia virus. Robert Strecker said that HIV was created in cell
culture from bovine visna virus, and bovine visna virus in turn was
created through a recombination of bovine leukemia virus with the sheep
visna virus. Jakob Segal said that HIV was a recombinant of STLV-I and
visna.</p>
<p>In the mid-80s when the various versions of the visna recombination
theory were introduced, SIV had not yet been discovered. I don't know
anyone before Nick who had said that HIV was a product of recombination
between SIV and visna.</p>
<p>In the book <span class="quote">"AIDS and the Doctors of
Death"</span>, Alan Cantwell wrote: <span class="quote">"I remember
distinctly the early morning phone call from Dr. Virginia
Livingston-Wheeler that started it all in August 1986."</span> And he
wrote she invited him to a meeting held by Robert Strecker, who <span
class="quote">"carefully explained the unique molecular composition of
the AIDS virus, emphasizing how it greatly resembles a virus in sheep
called <span class="quote">'visna virus.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>In the same book, Cantwell wrote that the Strecker brothers had
presented the visna theory in a report dated March 1986: <span
class="quote">"Strecker began to pass out copies of a report entitled
<span class="quote">'This is a Bio-Attack Alert.'</span> The manuscript
was dated March 28, 1986, and was written by the Strecker brothers. The
report contained detailed information on their theory, and provided
documented evidence to show that the AIDS epidemic was biological
warfare."</span></p>
<p>In the report, the Strecker brothers wrote: <span class="quote">"The
AIDS virus is Bovine Visna Virus (BVV) in man with a transacting
transcriptional regulator gene inherited from Bovine Leukemia
Virus"</span>.
[<a href=https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/>https://<wbr>strecker.<wbr>pugik.<wbr>com/<wbr>bio-<wbr>attack-<wbr>alert/<wbr></a>]
<span class="quote">"Bovine visna virus"</span> was an early name for
the bovine lentivirus that is now called BIV (bovine immunodeficiency
virus), which is not the same species of virus as the visna-maedi virus
in sheep. But Robert Strecker also claimed that <span
class="quote">"bovine visna virus"</span> was created in a laboratory
based on the sheep visna virus, so according to his nonsensical theory,
HIV was still ultimately descended from the sheep visna virus.</p>
<p>In December 1985, the Los Angeles Times published an interview of
John Seale that said: <span class="quote">"Seale, who is in private
practice and specializes in urinary and venereal diseases, said the AIDS
virus, which attacks the body's immune system, has one gene extra over
the Visna virus. [...] <span class="quote">'Inserting an extra gene into a
virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engineering,'</span>
Seale said."</span>
[<a href=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-12-19-mn-30652-story.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>latimes.<wbr>com/<wbr>archives/<wbr>la-<wbr>xpm-<wbr>1985-<wbr>12-<wbr>19-<wbr>mn-<wbr>30652-<wbr>story.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>In December 1985, a British communist newspaper called Morning Star
reported on Seale's hypothesis that HIV was a bioweapon. In a paper
titled <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared: Was the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth a Stasi success?"</span>, Erhard Geissler and
Robert Hunt Sprinkle wrote:
[<a href=f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf>f/<wbr>Geissler_<wbr>Sprinkle_<wbr>Disinformation_<wbr>squared.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 20 December 1985, nine days after <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
published its Drozdov interview, London's <em>Morning Star</em>, a
communist newspaper, reported that the New Zealand AIDS Foundation had
received a letter with claims similar to Professor Drozdov's. John Seale
had been reconsidering his presumption that the origin of HIV had been
natural. He now said that <span class="quote">"the AIDS virus may have
been manufactured in laboratories as a slow but deadly biological
warfare weapon."</span> He went on to say that <span
class="quote">"there was <span class="quote">'circumstantial
evidence'</span> to back the belief that the AIDS virus was genetically
engineered in a laboratory."</span>[56]</p>
<p>On 26 December 1985, Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">"World
Service,"</span> broadcasting in English, presented Seale's ominous new
inference as a conclusion.[57]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same paper, Geissler and Sprinkle also wrote that Jakob Segal
had presented the visna theory by May 1986: <span class="quote">"Five
months after his mention on Moscow Radio, Seale was contacted by an
ambitious new ally soon to eclipse all earlier theorists. In a letter
dated 29 May 1986, Jakob Segal, a Soviet citizen long retired from a
professorship of biology in East Germany, wrote to suggest that <span
class="quote">'the AIDS virus is a chimera.'</span> By this he meant a
recombinant of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and
the Maedi-Visna virus, a sheep lentivirus first described in Iceland, in
whose language <span class="quote">'maedi'</span> means dyspnea, or
difficulty breathing, and <span class="quote">'visna'</span> means
wasting."</span></p>
<p>HTLV-I is not even a lentivirus like HIV, visna, and BIV. Robert
Strecker claimed that HIV was a recombinant of bovine leukemia virus and
visna, even though BLV is not a lentivirus either. There is no part of
the genome of HIV that has over 50% nucleotide identity to HTLV-I or BLV
(apart from short parts of the genome where the similarity is due to
chance).</p>
<p>I found the text of Jakob Segal's 1986 report from archive.org. In
the report, Segal wrote that <span class="quote">"The 5' end of the
genome therefore originates from HTLV-I, its larger part with the 3' end
from Visna virus"</span> (so Segal, Seale, and Strecker seem to have all
suggested that a larger part of the genome came from visna, even though
Nick seems to suggest that a larger part comes from SIV and a smaller
part from visna):
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna>https://<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>details/<wbr>AIDS-<wbr>nature-<wbr>and-<wbr>origin/<wbr>page/<wbr>n9/<wbr>mode/<wbr>2up?<wbr>q=visna</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hybridisation between Visna end LAV/HTL7-III takes an entirely
different course (fig.2c). The ranges of hybridisation are evenly
distributed over the entire lenght of the genomes, making up altogether
35 per cent of their lenght.</p>
<p>To investigate in how far coincidental conformities can simulat
hybridisation, the LAV/HTLV-III strand was implanted in a reversed
direction in a further experiment (fig.2d). In that case there is no
hybridisation at any point, which indicates that the relations
demonstrated in fig.2c are not conditioned by coincidence.</p>
<p>It is therefore clearly shown that in the main part of their genomes
Visna and LAV/HTLV-III are largely in conformity. The differences may
well lie in the magnitude of mutations. On the other hand in this part
of the genome LAV/HTLV-III fundamentally differs from the genome of
HTLV-I. It is therefore completely excluded that the HTLV-I should of
itself have changed, by an unfortunate combination of mutations, into
the AIDS virus LAV/HTLV-III.</p>
<p>One might well be tempted to reverse Gallo's original hypothesis and
to assume, that the Visna virus spontaneously changed into the AIDS
virus. Yet, so far no scientist has gone as far as that conclusion - for
a very good reason. By a coincidence - or a series of coincidences - a
genome part of 275 nucleotides from the Visna virus would have had to
change so greatly, that at least 50 per cent of them fitted to the
corresponding section of the HTLV-I genome, since it is common to the
HTLV-I and the HTLV-III, as shown above. The probability that this might
happen is 1:6 x 10<sup>82</sup>. Such an event is therefore absolutely
impossible, and corresponding results will also be obtained, if, instead
of hybridising the genomes, their nucleotide sequences are compared with
oneanother. There could not have been a coincidental, spontaneous
transition from Visna to AIDS virus.</p>
<p>The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from HTLV-I, its larger
part with the 3' end from Visna virus. The whole thing is a <span
class="quote">"chimera"</span>, a system, of two components of different
origin, artificially by nature and only brought by the skills of genetic
engineering.</p>
<p>Recently the nucleotide chain of the Visna virus has been sequenced
(Sonigo et al. (21)). On that basis Stephens et al. (22) drew up a
phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses. According to this, the
LAV/HTLV-III are very closely related. A branch far remote from them
comprises HTLV-I, HTLV-II, BLV (bovine leukemia virus) and other animal
viruses. The marked [two words not visible] between HTLV-I and
LAV/HTLV-III is is also demonstrated by the phylogenetic trees drawn up
independently by Chiu et al. (23), Wayne-Hobson et al. (14), Gonda et
al. (24) and Watanabe et al. (25) (fig.4). A spontaneous transition from
the sub-family HTLV-I to the sub-family HTLV-III/Visna must be
completely excluded biologically.</p>

<p>In August 1986, the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine
published a letter which said:
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://<wbr>pmc.<wbr>ncbi.<wbr>nlm.<wbr>nih.<wbr>gov/<wbr>articles/<wbr>PMC1290430/<wbr>pdf/<wbr>jrsocmed00187-<wbr>0068b.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, The excellent editorial on the AIDS virus infection by John
Seale (August 1985 JRSM, pp 613-15) has stimulated a very productive
discussion. However, I would like to draw your attention to a commentary
on this paper on Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">'World
Service'</span> in English on 26 December 1985, 21.00 GMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifying the origin of a disease makes the search for a remedy
easier. Following this rule, Dr John Seale of Britain has concluded that
the AIDS virus has been artificially created and its appearance is
possibly the result of a human error. This conclusion supports the view
that the AIDS epidemic has been caused by experiments with humans
carried out in the USA as part of the development of new biological
weapons.</p>
<p>Dr Seale claims in his report that, from the viewpoint of genetic
engineering, to develop the AIDS virus artificially is not a problem,
for this it is only necessary to add one gene to the virus causing a
similar disease among sheep. There is ample evidence to believe that
such an operation has been carried out at a secret American
laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The person who sent the letter to the journal appears to have
misunderstood what Moscow Radio meant by Seale's report. In the letter
that was published in August 1985 in the Journal of the Royal Society of
Medicine, Seale did not yet write about the visna recombination theory,
and he didn't even speculate if HIV was a bioweapon.
[<a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801>https://<wbr>journals.<wbr>sagepub.<wbr>com/<wbr>doi/<wbr>epdf/<wbr>10.<wbr>1177/<wbr>014107688507800801</a>]
On December 20th 1985, articles where Seale speculated that HIV was a
bioweapon were published by both Morning Star and The Guardian, so by
Seale's report, Moscow Radio might have rather referred to either of
those articles instead.</p>
<p>The journal that published the letter about Seale also published
Seale's response to the letter, where he referred to two articles about
HIV that were published in the Soviet magazine Literaturnaya Gazeta, and
he wrote: <span class="quote">"These Soviet articles led me to consider
seriously the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have
been man-made."</span>
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://<wbr>pmc.<wbr>ncbi.<wbr>nlm.<wbr>nih.<wbr>gov/<wbr>articles/<wbr>PMC1290430/<wbr>pdf/<wbr>jrsocmed00187-<wbr>0068b.<wbr>pdf</a>]
Seale didn't explain how he heard about the Soviet articles, or if he
read the articles in Russian or translated to English, even though he
provided only English translations of the original Russian titles. Seale
may have heard about the Soviet articles from LaRouche's EIR magazine,
which also published Seale's articles about HIV, because a postscript in
the first Soviet article referred to EIR, which triggered a response
from EIR and EIR published an English translation of the Soviet
article.</p>
<h2>
<a href=#Who_influenced_who id=Who_influenced_who>Who influenced who</a>
</h2>
<p>I don't know if Seale, the Strecker brothers, or Segal came up with
the visna recombination theory first. None of them seemed to credit the
others as a source for their theory, except Robert Strecker suggested he
might have influenced Seale's theory.</p>
<p>In the Strecker Memorandum video, Robert Strecker said: <span
class="quote">"Dr. John Seale of the Royal Society of Medicine, has said
that the virus appeared to be manmade, in a sense, long before we did,
but he couldn't exactly construct how that may have occurred. We sort of
gave him maybe the information on how the viruses could have been
recombined to produce a new AIDS-like virus."</span>
[<a href=https://rapeutation.com/streckermemoscreenplay.pdf>https://<wbr>rapeutation.<wbr>com/<wbr>s<wbr>t<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>c<wbr>k<wbr>e<wbr>r<wbr>m<wbr>e<wbr>m<wbr>o<wbr>s<wbr>c<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>e<wbr>n<wbr>p<wbr>l<wbr>a<wbr>y<wbr>.<wbr>pdf</a>]
I don't know if Strecker meant information on BLV or visna or both,
because Seale initially said that HIV was made by adding an extra gene
to visna from an unspecified source, but later he said that HIV was a
recombinant of BLV and visna like Strecker. The report by the Strecker
brothers said that <span class="quote">"the AIDS virus is Bovine Visna
Virus (BVV) in man with a transacting transcriptional regulator gene
inherited from Bovine Leukemia Virus"</span>.
[<a href=https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/>https://<wbr>strecker.<wbr>pugik.<wbr>com/<wbr>bio-<wbr>attack-<wbr>alert/<wbr></a>]
So it's also possible that by the single gene from an unspecified
source, Segal meant the <span class="quote">"transacting transcriptional
regulator gene"</span> from BLV, but he just didn't mention BLV by
name.</p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle wrote that in 1992 Segal claimed that <span
class="quote">"the theory regarding the construction of HIV from a
cancer-causing virus infecting sheep is my personal scientific
achievement"</span>.
[<a href=f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf>f/<wbr>Geissler_<wbr>Sprinkle_<wbr>Disinformation_<wbr>squared.<wbr>pdf</a>,
translated] They also wrote: <span class="quote">"The Streckers, who
were manifestly eccentric, were never to be mentioned in Segal's
publications, never to be credited as an influence. The Segals did keep
track of Robert Strecker, but they began to only in July 1987, as Lilli
told an East German writer, Stefan Heym, in a telephone conversation
recorded by the Stasi.[89]"</span></p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle also mentioned that in a letter in 1986, Lilli
Segal wrote in German: <span class="quote">"The largest effect, however,
[was] achieved [in] an article in Sunday Express in October where our
theory as well as that proposed by Dr. Seal [sic] from London and a
Californian Prof. Strecker, unknown to us, had been compared."</span> By
<span class="quote">"unknown to us"</span>, she probably refererred to
only Strecker and not to both Strecker and Seale, because Jakob Segal
and Seale had earlier communicated through letters. The author of the
Sunday Express article wrote that they spoke with Seale, Segal, and
Strecker, and that all three had independently discovered that the <span
class="quote">"AIDS virus was artificially created by American
scientists"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-sundayexpress-independent.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>In a letter to Seale in May 1986, Segal claimed he had discovered the
visna theory independently of Seale.

<p>Douglas Selvage made this diagram of the evolution of the HIV
bioweapon theory, where he indicated that the visna recombination
element was introduced by Seale:

</div>
<p>Based on the sources I have found, Seale appears to have mentioned
the visna recombination theory earlier than the Segals or the Streckers,
but I don't know if that means that Seale originated the theory. It
might be that Seale, the Segals, and the Streckers represented different
arms of the same disinformation operation, and they were all instructed
to incorporate the visna element into their presentations. It's also
possible that in some source that has been overlooked, the Segals or
Streckers mentioned the visna theory before Seale.</p>

<p>I saved the following excerpts from the paper as notes.</p>
<hr />
<p>The story of how the Strecker brothers became involved in HIV
research sounds phony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1983 two brothers were, supposedly, engaged by the Security
Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, California, to form a health-maintenance
organization, an HMO. The local prevalence and typical actuarial costs
of AIDS cases would logically have altered the prospects of any such
plan. One brother was Robert B. Strecker, presenting himself as an
MD-PhD internist-gastroenterologist-pathologist-pharmacologist; the
other was Theodore A. Strecker, presenting himself as an attorney. A
literature review proceeded. Theodore <span class="quote">"had
difficulty estimating the probable cost of the <span
class="quote">'Human Retroviruses'</span> as related to [insurance]
premium costs and was led deeper and deeper into the literature of
virology attempting to solve the problem."</span> Soon, he <span
class="quote">"stumbled into a written order for the AIDS virus and a
written plan to inject disease during preventive vaccinations for
experimental purposes. ... Apparently, individuals in the United States
National Institute [sic] of Health and National Cancer Institute have
combined with the United Nation's World Health Organization to attack
the United States with BioWeapons."</span> As seen now in its Internet
afterlife, the document in which this charge appeared took for its title
a warning: <span class="quote">"THIS IS A BIO-ATTACK ALERT, MARCH 28,
1986."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Geissler pointed out that in the book <span class="quote">"Stasi: The
Untold Story of the East German Secret Police"</span>, John Koehler
wrote that Segal was still a die-hard Marxist in 1991 and Segal still
stuck to his story about HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his third paragraph, Koehler added this: <span class="quote">"I
spotted Segal's name in Stasi documents. ... In a 1991 interview with me
in Berlin, Segal presented himself as a die-hard Marxist, totally
incapable of accepting the demise of communist East Germany. Segal, then
eighty years old, insisted that his information on the origin of the HIV
virus [sic] was solid, and he denied having had any contact with the
Stasi. He was lying."</span>[103]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal's communist Jew friend advised him to send a copy of his
booklet to a Japanese communist writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal's work was now ostensibly <span class="quote">"in press"</span>
in West Germany - and under a distinguished editor. His other 12 March
1986 transmission was not in German but in English, and it went to
Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Professor [Shingo] Shibata, our common friend Eva Brück
[according to the Center for Jewish History a Holocaust survivor and the
author of <em>Shadows of the Past: Childhood Years in Austria
1933-1938</em>] gave me the advice, to send you a paper my wife an [sic]
I just finished. It deals with the origin of AIDS and concludes, that
this disease did not originate in Central Africa and come to us via the
Green Monkey, but that the AIDS virus is a chimera from HTLV-I and visna
virus, performed by gene surgery in the P-4 laborators [sic] of Fort
Detrick, Maryland, USA, in the fall 1977.</p>

<p>Shingo Shibata was a member of the Japanese Communist Party.

<p>Eva Brück worked for an English edition of a German trade union
newspaper. She translated texts from Russian to German, and she worked
as an interpreter for people including the Soviet propagandist Ilya
Ehrenburg:
[<a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Brück>https://<wbr>de.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Eva_<wbr>Brück</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1947 she married Josef Brück, who had been rescued from Vienna on
a Kindertransport in 1939. With him, the Lviv Jew, who was considered a
Soviet citizen by the British, she wanted to enter the Soviet Union in
1949, but they were detained in East Berlin and remained there out of
political conviction. In 1958 she became a citizen of the GDR. She
worked for the English edition of the trade union newspaper <em>Lehrer
der Welt</em>[1] and for other newspapers and magazines in the GDR.
Thanks to her knowledge of Russian, she also worked as a simultaneous
interpreter, for example for Ilya Ehrenburg at the World Peace Congress
in Vienna in 1952. She translated educational texts from Russian and
museum catalogs as well as a few comics by Hannes Hegen into English.
For her trips abroad to Scandinavia, Mongolia, North America, Asia,
Africa, and even Austria, she fought with the SED party bureaucracy over
travel permits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lilli Segal, Johannes Mario Simmel, and Nathaniel Lehrman's wife also
worked as interpreters. Lilli Segal wrote in her autobiography that she
traveled to several foreign countries when she worked as an interpreter:
<span class="quote">"During the first years of our residence in the GDR
I worked as a free lance document expert and translator. Because there
were, at that time, very few French translators, I was constantly called
upon by academies, ministries and trade unions to act as interpreter for
important delegations or at congresses. Although I enjoyed traveling to
Geneva, Helsinki, North Africa and even China, the constant separation
from my children and husband became too much for me and I wanted to
return to scientific work."</span>

<p>Jews from East Germany who were involved in promoting disinformation
about AIDS include Jakob Segal, Lilli Segal, Eva Brück, Samuel Mitja
Rapoport, Markus Wolf, and Stefan Heym (who lived in East Germany even
though his interview of Segal was published in West Germany). But
according to ChatGPT, there were only about 400-1500 Jews in East
Germany:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are the main scholarly and archival sources supporting those
figures on the Jewish population in the <strong>German Democratic
Republic (DDR)</strong>:</p>

had been shuffled over to new direction. Captain Kairies had filed this
note: <span class="quote">"Today instructed by comrade advisor not to

by S. are to be arranged by instructor."</span>[154] The terms <span

KGB responsible for maintenance of cooperation with the MfS. By 1962 the
MfS had decided to end its cooperation with Segal. Its reasons were
substantive: <span class="quote">"[H]e adopts a platform contrary to the

<hr />
<p>In 1990, which was about 2 years before Yuri Andropov and Günter
Bohnsack admitted that the Fort Detrick theory was disinformation, the
theory was said to be fake in a book coauthored by a British historian
and a Soviet defector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1990, not so long after 1985 but well before 25 December 1991,
when the Soviet Union dissolved itself, Oleg Gordievsky, a former
Colonel of the KGB, acknowledged that the myth had been KGB
disinformation. But this acknowledgement came on a single page in a long
book, co-authored with Christopher Andrew, and cannot now count as
evidence. According to Gordievsky, the article published in
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> <span class="quote">"was founded on a
report of the East German biophysicist and Russian by birth Professor
Jakob Segal, who attempted to demonstrate by <span
class="quote">'detailed proofs'</span> (which had been throughly
disproved in the meantime) that the virus [causing AIDS] was
artificially created in Fort Detrick from two naturally occurring
viruses."</span>[156] Yet Gordievsky could not have known these details
through his own experience. In May 1985, five months before the article
appeared and six months before Segal took up the myth, Gordievsky had
been recalled to Moscow and detained as a British double, which he was.
He escaped through Finland two months later, never to return, even to
post-Soviet Russia, where he remains condemned to death in absentia.
Gordievsky's acknowledgement, however earnest, must be set aside as
hearsay.</p>

Geissler apparently translated a German translation of the book back to
English.</p>
<p>The original English text of the first edition published in 1990
doesn't say <span class="quote">"detailed proofs"</span> but <span

<blockquote>
<p>Probably the most successful active measure in the Third World during
the early years of the Gorbachev era, promoted by a mixture of overt
propaganda and covert action by Service A, was the attempt to blame AIDS
on American biological warfare. The story originated in the summer of
1983 in an article published in the pro-Soviet Indian newspaper
<em>Patriot</em>, alleging that the AIDS-virus had been <span
class="quote">"manufactured"</span> during genetic engineering
experiments at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Initially, the story had little
impact, but it was revived with great effect by the Russian
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> in October 1985. In its resurrected form,
the AIDS story was bolstered by a report from a retired East German,
Russian-born biophysicist, Professor Jacob Segal, which sought to
demonstrate through <span class="quote">"circumstantial evidence"</span>
(since thoroughly discredited) that the virus had been artificially
synthesized at Fort Detrick from two natural, existing viruses, VISNA
and HTLV-1. Thus assisted by quasi-scientific jargon, the AIDS
fabrication not merely swept through the Third World but also took in
some of the Western media. In October 1986 the conservative British
<em>Sunday Express</em> made an interview with Professor Segal the basis
of its main front-page story. In the first six months of 1987 alone the
story received major coverage in over forty Third World
countries.[43]</p>
<p>At the very height of its success, however, the AIDS active measure
was compromised by the <span class="quote">"new thinking"</span> in
Soviet foreign policy. Gorbachev told a Soviet media conference in July
1987: <span class="quote">"We tell the truth and nothing but the
truth."</span> He and his advisers were clearly concerned that Western
exposure of Soviet disinformation threatened to take a little of the
gloss off the new Soviet image in the West. Faced with official American
protests and the repudiation of the AIDS story by the international
scientific community, including the leading Soviet AIDS expert, Viktor
M. Zhdanov, the Kremlin for the first time showed signs of public
embarrassment at a successful active measures campaign. In August 1987,
U.S. officials were told in Moscow that the AIDS story was officially
disowned. Soviet press coverage of the story came to an almost complete
halt; it has not been mentioned at all by Soviet media since September
1988.[44] In 1990, however, the story was still circulating not merely
in the Third World but also in the more gullible parts of the Western
media. A further interview with Professor Segal, along with film of Fort
Detrick, the alleged home of the AIDS virus, was featured prominently in

<p>Soviet sources promoted the Segals, Strecker, and Seale, who all
claimed that HIV was a recombinant of visna and some other virus:</p>

<p>For public consumption, as noted by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>,
Soviet stories consistently cited four conveniently vocal conspiracy

<hr />
<p>The story that HIV was created in Fort Detrick was promoted by Rolf
Wagenbrecht, who was the head of the disinformation department of Stasi.
Günter Bohnsack was the head of the <span class="quote">"trade and
industry"</span> section of the disinformation department, but the three
people he credited for popularizing about the story about HIV were Jakob
Segal, Stefan Heym, and Johannes Mario Simmel, who were all Jews (I only
included Geissler's translation of Bohnsack's text here, and I omitted
the original German text):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long thereafter, on 27 January 1992, AIDS disinformation entered
its exponential phase, its disinformation-squared phase.
<em>Panorama</em>, a German television news magazine, was reporting that
the story of HIV having spread from Fort Detrick <span
class="quote">"after a gene-accident ... had been elaborated by the
Russian KGB and the Stasi, as [Colonel Dr. Rolf] Wagenbreth and his team
boast today. They also took responsibility for its world-wide
dissemination."</span>[177] When Segal had most actively been
propagating the myth, Wagenbreth had been head of Department X - the
<span class="quote">"X"</span> meaning <span class="quote">"10"</span>
of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance, HV A; thus, Wagenbreth had
been head of HV A/X. His responsibility, about which he refused to
comment during the broadcast, had been disinformation.</p>
<p>Stasi veterans, their civil liberties assured, were stepping up to
brag: to take credit, not to take blame. More soon followed, Günter
Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer most notably. Bohnsack said he had been
head of HV A/X Section 7, <span class="quote">"Trade and
Industry,"</span>[178] but was later described as having beer
responsible for disinformation within HV A/X.[179] Brehmer said he had
been responsible for Western agencies within HV A/X Section 5, <span
class="quote">"Secret Services."</span>[178]</p>
<p>That same year, 1992, Bohnsack and Brehme published a book,
<em>Auftrag Irreführung. Wie die Stas Politik im Westen machte</em>
[<em>Mission Misleading: How the Stasi Made Politics in the West</em>].
<span class="quote">"The superpower [the Soviet Union] dealt the
cards,"</span> they wrote, <span class="quote">"and also took care not
to reveal its own hand. It respected the junior partner [the GDR], but
saw the appropriate balance of power at the negotiation table through
Moscow's eyes - and so the GDR shrunk back to being a small country in
central Europe."</span> Then came five paragraphs about the myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Moscow communicated clearly when it came to the planned AIDS
campaign against the USA. The quick spread of this terrible disease to
millions of people, especially in Africa, renewed the discussion about
the origin of the virus. During this time, a number of theses and
theories were proposed; a prominent one among them was that new genetic
research undertaken in the US could have produced a deformed organism
that threatened humanity. With this background, the concept for the
campaign practically wrote itself. The campaign allowed us to tie in our
other active measures, such as our argument, launched to reach across
the world, that the United States already had experience with germ
warfare in Korea.</p>
<p>The substance of our disinformation action consisted of the following
propositions: The AIDS virus was created in a special secure virus and
gene laboratory of the military research institute in Fort Detrick
(Maryland/USA). By 1977 it had passed via experimental subjects
uncontrolled into the public sphere and had initiated the deadly
catastrophe. The USA as repository of all threats - the classic closeup
used by the East. And the HVA went all out to publicize the idea.</p>
<p>First, the East Berlin professor Jakob Segal took up this version.
Stefan Heym made sure, through an interview he conducted for the West
Berlin [daily newspaper] <em>tageszeitung (taz)</em> with the scientist,
to spread the AIDS lie in Europe, [and] journalists carried the story to
Africa and to other regions afflicted by the disease.</p>
<p>Finally, the best-selling author Johannes Mario Simmel, who was then
writing about the topic of genetic research, availed himself innocently
of the materials sent to him and adopted the details of our
construction. The corresponding passages appear in the 1987 novel
<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>, published by Droemer
Knaur in Munich. A masterpiece of active measures, as one in the GDR
leadership circle found it to be.</p>
<p>Who contributed knowingly to disseminating this dirty story and who
deceived themselves and let themselves be used is an open question. The
subsequent General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev,
did, by the way, apologize to the United States for this
action.[105]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Geissler also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boghardt's assessments of Bohnsack and Brehmer and also of Klaus
Behling, a former GDR diplomat, were not limited to written records but
were enhanced by more interactive personal contacts. These assessments
occurred long after Jakob and Lilli Segal had died. According to
Boghardt and his sources, the GDR Ministry of State Security became
involved in the myth through its branch responsible for disinformation
and other <span class="quote">"active measures,"</span> Department X
[10] of the <em>Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung</em> HV A [Main Directorate
for Reconnaissance]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having decided to revive the AIDS campaign, the KGB informed its East
German counterpart unambiguously that Moscow expected it to participate.
The East Germans were told specifically to employ a"scientific approach"
and produce disinformation contending the AIDS virus had been developed
at Fort Detrick from where it spread to the general population through
human testing. Beyond those obligatory details the East Germans were
given a free hand in devising their own strategy and spreading the
story.[181]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"As Moscow shifted its active measures focus to
subjects other than AIDS,"</span> Boghardt has related, <span
class="quote">"the East Germans became the AIDS campaign's primary
sponsor."</span>[182] The East German <span class="quote">"agent of
choice"</span>[181] to spread the fiction on behalf of the KGB and MfS
was, according to Boghardt and his sources, Professor Jakob Segal.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal's coauthor thought that Segal was influenced by the anonymous
author called <span class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Ronald Dehmlow (born 1949), co-author on English[91] and
German[184] versions of the Segals' principal HIV-origins manuscript, to
which Dehmlow remembers having made only minimal contributions, has long
assumed that Jakob Segal had been motivated by the 1984 <span
class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span> article.[46,185] As relayed to one of
us, E.G., through a confidential intermediary in June 2013, <span
class="quote">"Hatch"</span> had actually once met Segal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the first and only meeting with Segal, I realized quickly that
Segal was not interested in a sound scientific discussion. As stated in
my reply to the TAZ,[186] his arguments [were] not scientifically valid.
About the idea that he was controlled by the Stasi, I did not [think he
was;] my impression was more that he enjoyed standing in the
spotlight.[45]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In early 1987 Segal tried to contact <span
class="quote">"Hatch"</span> after hearing <span
class="quote">"Hatch"</span> was astonished at not having been cited by
Segal. <span class="quote">"The reason is very simple,"</span> Segal
wrote defensively, if not believably. <span class="quote">"We did not
know your papers. ... Now it is clear for us that you had published
warning articles at a time when we did not yet know about
AIDS."</span>[187]</p>
<p>Despite this denial, Segal had had in his possession at least one
<span class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span> paper as early as April 1986.
It was included in <em>Operation AIDS</em>, the book Sigusch sent Segal
as a courtesy while Segal was writing his first myth-bearing manuscript,
which Sigusch would later reject. Perhaps Segal ignored that paper, even
if he had read it, because therein <span class="quote">"Hatch"</span>
wrote this: <span class="quote">"It is highly probable that AIDS had
been transmitted from monkeys to man."</span> In addition, <span
class="quote">"Hatch"</span> asked, <span class="quote">"[Is] the AIDS
virus recombinant[?]"</span>[88] and concluded that <span
class="quote">"a calculated production of infectious agents carrying the
properties of AIDS viruses is unlikely."</span>[111]</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span> was a sharp critic of the
myth, which he described as <span class="quote">"deception of the
public. There is no convincing argument for the assumption of an
assembly of the AIDS-virus ... by means of gene technology as Segal
assumes. Segal's computational tricks [<em>Rechenkunststücke</em>]
should only cause the shaking of one's head [<em>Kopfschütteln</em>] ...
Much more closely related to HIV [than Visna virus] are viruses isolated
from different monkey species. Why Segal persistently ignores their
existence will remain a riddle."</span>[188] <span class="quote">"Booby
Hatch"</span> firmly advised the editor of Wechselwirkung not to publish
Segal's work.[189] That said, at least until 1988 - when the true
descent of the AIDS viruses began to be clarified - <span
class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span> was convinced the HIV could have
originated from careless experimentation.[45,190] He was not a
conspiracy theorist. He was an accident theorist. Segal was both.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal was a close friend of the communist Jew Samuel Mitja Rapoport,
who proposed publishing an article about the HIV conspiracy theory in
the daily news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 29 November, Dr. Helmut Theodor, a high-ranking staffer at the GDR
Ministry of Health, noted that Samuel Mitja Rapoport, Professor of
Biochemistry at Humboldt University and a leading communist health
politician as well as Segal's colleague and close friend, had proposed
<span class="quote">"to publish in the daily news a paper on AIDS.
Objective: The AIDS agent has been manipulated and has escaped from an
American laboratory (biological weapons)."</span>[197] Referring to
reports about the presence of antibodies against the AIDS agent in sera
taken in Africa between 1960 and 1965 - and presumably also because his
superior, Health Minister Professor Ludwig Mecklinger, had decided
already by early 1984 not to deal with the AIDS problem in public[298] -
Theodor rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>This story is a little strange, since Rapoport never dealt with the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth in any of his numerous publications. He might
have realized soon that the myth was totally unfounded.[198] Or Theodor
might not have been informed correctly. Perhaps the proposal came not
from Rapoport but from Segal. Documents available to us are silent on
this question.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1985, three days after Theodor's rejection of the
putative Rapoport proposal, Segal wrote to Müller-Hill, mentioning a
suspicion raised primarily <span class="quote">"in the Indian newspaper
Citizen [sic] and"</span> secondarily in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
that the AIDS agent had been assembled, through genetic engineering, to
be a biological weapon.[104] Neither of the Segals was to mention either
article in any published work.</p>

(<em>Bundesarchiv</em>): <span class="quote">"Helmut Theodor, note. 29
November 1985. BArch DQ1 13080. Translated by E.G."</span>.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Samuel Mitja Rapoport says: <span
class="quote">"Of Jewish descent and a committed communist, he fled
Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany, and moved to the United
States. In 1950, as a result of an investigation of un-American
activities, he was offered a professorship in East Berlin."</span>

<hr />
<p>Lilli Segal claimed that her source for the Fort Detrick theory was
the Urania Press (which was published by the URANIA Society, whose
biology section was headed by Erhard Geissler beween 1971 and 1990):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, according to Christopher Dobson of <em>The Sunday
Telegraph</em>, Lilli Segal told officials of the US Embassy in East
Berlin <span class="quote">"that her source for the accusations that the
virus was made at Fort Detrick was the East German Urania Press.
Urania's prime function is disseminating Soviet propaganda."</span>[234]
Whether Dobson's description of the prime function of the URANIA was
Lilli's wording or his own is unclear. In any event, the description was
wrong. URANIA's Biology Section, which would have been the Segals'
contact point, was no mouthpiece, not the KGB's, not the Stasi's.</p>
<p>The URANIA Society - <em>Gesellschaft zur Verbreitung
wissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse</em> [Society for the Dissemination of
Scientific Knowledge] - was a <span class="quote">"mass
organization"</span> of the GDR acting under the supervision and
direction of the Socialist Unity Party, the SED. It was funded almost
solely by the government, its main function being to spread Marxist
ideology. Nonetheless, in its natural-sciences sections, members -
mainly scientists and teachers - informed the public on progress in
their respective fields. The Biology Section, headed by E.G. between
1971 and 1990, was heavily involved, for example, in <span
class="quote">"disseminating scientific knowledge"</span> about modern
genetics, cancer research, neurobiology, and so on. Even topics breaking
a GDR taboo, such as the taboo against research into human behavior,
URANIA could and did explore.</p>
<p>Some members of the Biology Section had also been involved in
activities to prevent the military misuse of new developments in
molecular biology. E.G., contributor to the 1984 yearbook of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)[213] and
consultant to SIPRI from 1985 to 2000 for biological warfare
matters,[214] expressed his concern about the potential of genetic
engineering to develop biological and toxic warfare agents. The SIPRI
Yearbook contribution was translated and reprinted in a booklet
published by the Presidium of URANIA.[215] In another SIPRI book, E.G.
quoted,[216] <em>inter alia</em>, the US Department of Defense, which in
Soviet Military Power 1984 had explained <span class="quote">"that for
biological warfare purposes, genetic engineering could open a large
number of possibilities. Normally harmless, non-disease-producing
organisms could be modified to become highly toxic or produce diseases
for which an opponent has no known treatment or cure. Other agents, now
considered too unstable for storage or biological warfare applications,
could be changed sufficiently to be an effective agent."</span>[217]
This assessment was also quoted in a popular-science journal edited by
the GDR Academy of Sciences.[218] Segal himself quoted a French
translation of a passage from this assessment in 1986 in <span
class="quote">"Le SIDA - sa nature et son origine"</span>[241] and
quoted a shorter version in a chapter he wrote for another book.[219]
After a 1986 experts' meeting in which E.G. rejected allegations about
Fort Detrick being responsible for AIDS, Segal stopped using this
passage altogether.[220]</p>
<p>The Segals might well have been influenced by URANIA insofar as
genetic engineering was described as making bioweaponry research more
dangerous, and they might have wondered whether American concerns about
Soviet efforts were designed to screen America's own efforts. But the
myth itself was not to be found there. To the contrary, in 1988, under
URANIA's aegis, E.G. published an article criticizing the myth
expressly.[221]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The founder and president of URANIA Society was Werner Rothmaler, who
fled Germany to Spain in 1933 because he was a member of the German
Communist Party, but he was later forcibly repatriated to Germany.

<p>An article published in Los Angles Times in 1987 said: <span
class="quote">"Upon learning of the Segal report, U.S. embassy officers
in Berlin met on Oct. 10 with Dr. Lilli Segal to point out the
fallacies. She repeated her allegations, citing as a source Urania
Press, a publishing house run by the government of East Germany that
disseminates propaganda to the general public."</span>

<p>Geissler also pointed out that when the Segals wrote about how the
world's first BSL4 laboratory was installed in Fort Detrick in 1977,
they cited a popular scientific book published by Urania Press.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal were members of a division of Stasi that was
responsible for gathering scientific and technical information published
in western countries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob Segal was just an <span class="quote">"IM,"</span> an
<em>inoffizieller Mitarbeiter</em> or <span class="quote">"unofficial
collaborator,"</span> an informer for the Ministry for State Security -
one of approximately 180,000 IMs reporting to the MfS.[230,231] Whether
he was actively informing in the mid-1980s we do not know. Lilli,
however, did report to the MfS at least twice on the interest of the US
Embassy in East Berlin in Jakob's activities.[81,116] No document
reveals whether she was asked to provide such reports or provided them
conscientiously - or prudentially.</p>
<p>In one document dealing with the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth, Colonel
Oldenburg, deputy head of Department IX/C of the HV A, mentioned that
Segal and his wife <span class="quote">"are registered by HV
A/SWT/XIII."</span>[232] This registration was of long-standing and
could not have related to AIDS. Moreover, responsibilities of the
departments chancing upon the Segals' AIDS activities did not include
<span class="quote">"active measures."</span> Department IX of the HV A
performed external counter-intelligence, especially in West Germany.
Department HV A/SWT was responsible for the gathering of scientific and
technical information in developed <span class="quote">"capitalistic
countries."</span> HA II, among whose filings were found Lilli's two
reports and Oldenburg's comment on the Segals' registration, was
responsible for counter-intelligence activities within the GDR
proper.</p>

<hr />
<p>Geissler wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 26 October 1986, London's <em>Sunday Express</em> published <span
class="quote">"Aids sensation."</span>[85] This article evidently was
John Seale's doing. (Figure 9) The day the article appeared, Segal wrote
to Seale saying <span class="quote">"it was a wonderful idea of yours to
put this journalist of Sunday Express on the AIDS problem. He phoned us
no less than three times in order to get additional
information."</span>[288]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of the Sunday Express article wrote that they had spoken
to Seale, Segel, and Strecker, and that all three independently came up
with the theory that HIV was created in an American laboratory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE killer AIDS virus was artificially created by American scientists
during laboratory experiments which went disastrously wrong - and a
massive cover-up has kept the secret from the world until today.</p>
<p>This is the sensational claim made independently by three
international experts - and they reject the widely-held belief that Aids
originated after an African green monkey bit a man.</p>
<p>They are compiling separate detailed dossiers on why they are
convinced that the virus now sweeping the world is man-made. They will
have the reports published soon.</p>
<p>The Sunday Express has spoken to all three experts and obtained
details of their key conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article Seale falsely said that Segal <span
class="quote">"holds no particular political beliefs or views at
all"</span>, even though Segal was a hardcore communist.</p>
<p>In the article Strecker was quoted as having said: <span
class="quote">"The two viruses which were used, according to all my
research and studies, are Maedi-Visna and Bovine Leukemia."</span>
However he didn't mention bovine visna virus.</p>
<p>Seale had earlier said that HIV was created by adding an extra gene
to visna from an unspecified source, but in the Sunday Express article,
Seale now suggested that HIV included elements of bovine leukemia virus,
even though unlike Strecker who said that HIV was a deliberately created
bioweapon, Seale said that HIV was probably created by accident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Seale, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and formerly
consultant in venerology at the Middlesex and St. Thomas' Hospitals in
London, believed Aids was genetically engineered in a laboratory by
accident by combining part of the Maedi-Visna virus found in sheep and
Bovine Leukaemia virus from cattle, which is similar to HTLV-1.</p>
<p>Dr. Seale said: <span class="quote">"Combined, these to lethal animal
viruses would give all the symptoms of Aids."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"The Maedi-Visna virus is a slow, infectious
virus causing wasting of the body, progressive destruction of the brain
and lungs, and loss of weight."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"The Bovine Leukaemia virus would cause immune
deficiency and the formation of solid white cells in the
brain."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"My firm conviction is that a scientist in a
laboratory somewhere, probably in the United States and doing cancer
research with the two viruses, accidentally spliced elements of both
together and created Aids."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"But the scientist, of any body else in the
laboratory, would easily have been infected with the new virus through
any minute cut or even by inhaling into the lungs."</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">"The Aids virus, of course, takes about seven
years to incubate, and the scientist would be totally unaware that
anything was wrong."</span></p>
<p>Dr. Seale said he did not necessarily agree with Professor Segal that
this took place in a military establishment. <span class="quote">"I
think it is more likely to have been an ordinary laboratory where cancer
research is being carried out."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal was interviewed by a journalist who ended up not publishing the
interview because of questions about Segal's heteroduplex
micrographs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This caller was <em>Stern</em> journalist Hans-Herrmann Klare,[334]
who later published a critical review of the myth.[335] He told Heym
that <em>Stern</em> would not publish the interview <span
class="quote">"because of a very simple reason: The fundamental argument
of Segal's chain of evidence in my view collapses."</span></p>
<p>According to Klare, Segal's data regarding the interaction between
the genomes of two different viruses were irreproducible. Klare asked
Heym where Segal had published his experimental data. Heym answered that
the said experiments had not been carried out by Segal himself. Heym
conceded he would not be able to comment on Klare's critique but would
have to call Segal for clarification.[333] (Figure 18)</p>
<p>Heym himself believed he had seen evidence of the phenomenon Segal
had described. In his files at home, Heym had copies of electron
micrographs showing <span class="quote">"these gene threads that stick
together."</span>[333] Heym presumably was referring to electron
micrographs presented by the Segals in several papers.[91,336,337] These
pictures had not been created by Segal or his collaborators but had been
reproduced from a paper already published in early 1985.[338] The <span
class="quote">"gene threads"</span> shown were strains of viral nucleic
acids fused by heteroduplex hybridization, a technique developed in 1961
to estimate the relationship between different species, including
viruses, before more precise evaluations had been made possible by
sequence analysis. Nevertheless, Jakob Segal described the heteroduplex
technique as <span class="quote">"a gene manipulation at the highest
level [<em>Genmanipulation auf höchster Ebene</em>]"</span>[339] - by
1986 a false description.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A Jewish fiction writer wrote a popular novel about the Fort Detrick
theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prominent among the Stasi's surmised successes was inducing a
venerable Austrian author to write a novel advertising the myth as
reality.</p>
<p>Johannes Mario Simmel was born in Vienna in 1924. His father, a
chemist, was a Jew; at the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by
Germany in 1938, the elder Simmel fled to London.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Still more information, especially about how and with what success
the Stasi used Simmel as their instrument, was added by Klaus Behling,
the former GDR diplomat, in a short article in the widely circulated
German newspaper BILD[179] and in an additional book.[365]</p>
<p>Boghardt has written that the <span class="quote">"biggest
coup"</span> of the HV A was to send Simmel <span
class="quote">"material pertaining to Segal's AIDS theory"</span> and
then to find that he had used it as hoped in a work of popular
fiction.[366] The background for this claim was Behling's 8 April 2000
BILD article, <span class="quote">"Stasi eavesdropper: The AIDS lie and
the misused Simmel."</span> Behling had quoted Bohnsack, who</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reveals the disinformation campaigns of the Stasi. By means of
telephone surveillance we learned that Johannes Mario Simmel planned to
write a book on biological weapons. We passed material on to him, [and]
a GDR scientist named Prof. Segal - our IM [our informer] - provided
expertise. In his novel <em>Doch mit den Clowns kamen die Träanen</em>
[<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>] the legend was
disseminated a million times over that the AIDS virus escaped from a
weapons laboratory of the USA. Our aim was to make the Africans angry
against the USA because that plague is most widespread there.[179]</p>

<p>After the war in occupied Austria, Simmel worked as a translator and
interpreter for the United States Office of Military Government.

<hr />
<p>Erhard Geissler wrote a paper where he debunked Segal in 1987, but he
decided to not publish the paper after a meeting he had with a big wig
at the East German communist party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feist directed E.G. to give him the manuscript, and he, Feist, would
discuss the matter with Karl Seidel, head of the health department of
the Central Committee, <em>das Zentralkomitee</em> or <em>ZK</em>.[384]
After delivering the manuscript, E.G. was to see Seidel, on 9 March.</p>
<p>Seidel was extremely reserved. He made no mention of the manuscript's
factual arguments but emphasized that the CIA of course would appreciate
being absolved of AIDS-related accusations. Then he threatened
distinctly. If E.G. were to publish the manuscript, the leadership of
the Party would assume that he had acted on behalf of the CIA.[385]
Since any such interpretation of his intentions could have been lethal
in East Germany, E.G. decided to forgo publication.</p>
<p>On 11 March 1987, two days after E.G.'s appointment with Seidel, an
anonymous HA XX/1 document noted that Comrade Seidel had been informed
only the day after the appointment, 10 March 1987, about Heym's
interview with Segal. Presumably an officer of HA XX/1, responsible for
public health, had been the informer since an addendum noted: <span
class="quote">"Comrade Prof. Seidel knows the circumstances of the
publication of Prof. Segal's opinions about the AIDS problem and [the
theories that] have been supported by him. Prof. Seidel immediately
realized that any internal discussions of Segal's hypotheses regarding
the origin and spread of AIDS counteract the political [purpose] of
these publications and have to be prevented."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In 1992 Segal claimed that the visna theory was his <span
class="quote">"personal scientific achievement"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, then, Segal responded to <em>Panorama</em>, the
television newsmagazine,[177] that <span class="quote">"the claim the
Stasi came up with that theory and had made use of me to spread it is
completely ridiculous. They could have elaborated it only with thorough
specialist knowledge, with which Stasi officers had hardly been
equipped. I repeat again explicitly that the theory regarding the
construction of HIV from a cancer-causing virus infecting sheep is my
personal scientific achievement."</span>[428]</p>

<p>Based on in-depth research into the files of the former state party
SED, the East German Ministry of Health, and MfS service units in the
BStU archives, molecular biologist and bioethicist Erhard Geissler
concluded that J. Segal's <span class="quote">"propaganda
campaign"</span> was <span class="quote">"by no means"</span> a
disinformation campaign by the MfS.[7] There is no evidence in the BStU
archives that the HV A played a role in the creation or dissemination of
the various versions of Segal's hypothesis.[8] Geissler found important
sources on the SED government's AIDS policy in the holdings of the other
MfS service units in the BStU archive, as well as sources concerning the
activities of Jakob and Lilli Segal and the negative reaction of most
East German experts to Segal's AIDS thesis. Based on these sources, he
concluded that the MfS only learned of Segal's thesis in September
1986.[9] However, Geissler did not, or did not visibly, reflect on the
fact that the HV A's archives, which shed light on the HV A's
activities, are in fact not available for research. The lack of evidence
of any influence by the HV A does not constitute proof of its
inactivity, but is primarily due to the current state of sources.
Findings of influence or non-influence on the Segals and their research
by the MfS must be evaluated against this background.</p>
<p>However, the authors of this study have uncovered new documents on
the KGB's disinformation campaign and the accompanying role of the HV A
in the archives of the former Security and Intelligence Services of
Bulgaria (AKRDOPBGDSRSBNA or COMDOS-A) in Sofia and, thanks to
inferences from these files, also in the archives of the Federal Office
of State Security (BStU) in Berlin. They also drew on the former HV A
database (SIRA: System of Information Research of the HV A)[10] and the
(partial) index card of the HV A <span
class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span>[11], two sources that have not been
used in previous research.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One example of this is the journalistic activity of the American
psychiatrist Nathaniel S. Lehrman, who - apparently unknowingly - acted
as a multiplier of the KGB's disinformation on AIDS in the USA. In
various articles for the New York-based African-American newspaper <span
class="quote">"Amsterdam News,"</span> he hinted at a possible <span
class="quote">"AIDS conspiracy"</span> by the American government. In
November 1985, he allegedly claimed to the newspaper that the spread of
the AIDS epidemic in parts of Africa was the result of CIA
bacteriological and chemical experiments; that similar experiments were
openly conducted on Western homosexuals, drug addicts, and African
Americans; and that the Centers for Disease Control had participated in
CIA experiments. All three claims fit Zapevalov's article in
Literaturnaya Gazeta and the guidance the KGB had given the Bulgarians.
Beyond the KGB's theories, Lehrman claimed that chemical agents were
likely responsible for AIDS and that the associated HTL virus caused
only a mild infection.[77] Lehrman later denied in a letter to the
editor of the Amsterdam News[78] and in a press release[79] that he had
ever made the first three KGB-related claims.</p>
<p>In the February [1986] press release, he focused more on his thesis
that there might be a chemical agent causing AIDS.[80] However, in his
letter to the editor, he left open the possibility that the <span
class="quote">"spread of AIDS in Africa could be the result of
activities by the American government, including the CIA."</span>[81] In
the press release, he softened his statement on alleged human
experiments, which was summarized in the newspaper report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although our government did conduct such <span
class="quote">"experiments"</span> on unwitting populations, I did not
say that they were conducted <span class="quote">"openly,"</span> nor
that they were certainly conducted on homosexuals, drug addicts, or
Blacks, which I suspect, however.[82]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another article in the <span class="quote">"Amsterdam News"</span>
in January 1986, he revived his theory of a chemical agent causing AIDS
and suggested that the possibility that <span class="quote">"religious
terrorists"</span> or others with <span class="quote">"gay dust"</span>
wanted to kill not only homosexuals, but also drug addicts and African
Americans. He hypothetically asked whether AIDS in Africa could be the
result of the activities of <span class="quote">"American government
agencies"</span> seeking to effect a change of leadership there.[83]</p>
<p>The question arises: Did Lehrman work for the KGB? There is no
evidence of any knowing or willing activity on behalf of the KGB.
Nevertheless, there were indications of possible indirect influence by
Moscow on him. In his letter to the editor of the <span
class="quote">"Amsterdam News,"</span> Lehrman substantiated his claim
of possible CIA involvement in the spread of AIDS by pointing to an
issue of the Washington magazine <span class="quote">"Covert Action
Information Bulletin"</span> (CAIB) from the summer of 1982
(No. 17).[84]</p>
<p>The CAIB had a colorful past. Its founding by CIA defector Philip
Agee, some left-wing Washington journalists, and disaffected former CIA
employees was announced in 1978 at the 11th World Festival of Youth and
Students in Cuba. According to the memos of defected KGB archivist
Vasily Mitrokhin, the <span class="quote">"K"</span> (Intelligence) line
of the KGB's First General Staff was behind this founding. Agee had long
been listed as a KGB agent (code name: PONT), according to Mitrokhin's
notes, while the other members of the CAIB's editorial board (KGB code
name: RUPOR) knew nothing of this. A working group with employees from
the <span class="quote">"K"</span> line and the <span
class="quote">"A"</span> service of the KGB's First General Staff,
responsible for active measures, was set up under the leadership of VN
Kosterin, the deputy head of Service A, to supply the CAIB with
compromising materials about the CIA. Ultimately, however, the KGB found
it difficult to find enough classified material for the quarterly
publication. Therefore, the publishers searched for publicly available
materials that could be used against the CIA or American government
agencies.[85]</p>
<p>Even though Lehrman was unknowingly a multiplier of the KGB's AIDS
disinformation, the KGB nevertheless used his publications to
substantiate its own disinformation thesis. In a follow-up article to
Zapevalov's contribution, the <span class="quote">"Literaturnaya
Gazeta"</span> on May 17, 1986, entitled <span class="quote">"AIDS: More
Questions Than Answers,"</span> quoted Lehrman as an American expert who
confirmed the theory of the artificial origin of AIDS. He claimed, the
paper continued, that AIDS victims <span class="quote">"could in some
cases be the targets of premeditated murder"</span> and named the
possible perpetrator - the CIA.[86] <span class="quote">"Literaturnaya
Gazeta"</span> had not invented the quotes; they came from Lehrman's
press release, which was also available to HV A87 and presumably to the
KGB or at least to the <span class="quote">"Literaturnaya
Gazeta."</span>[88]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In the AIDS-themed issue of CAIB in 1987, there were two articles
about the AIDS bioweapon theory by Robert Lederer, who was a member of
the editorial board of CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the same and the following issue of CAIB, there was a longer
article on AIDS by journalist and editorial board member Robert Lederer,
who presented several <span class="quote">"alternative theories"</span>
on the origin of the HIV virus.[93] He wrote not only about the
possibility of an artificial origin at Fort Detrick based on the
theories of Jakob Segal,[94] but also about other possible origins in
connection with the American government's alleged chemical and
biological warfare plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert Lederer is a gay Jew who grew up in the DC area.
[<a href=https://www.fightback.nyc/bob-lederer>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>fightback.<wbr>nyc/<wbr>bob-<wbr>lederer</a>]</p>
<p>The description of a podcast about CAIB says: <span
class="quote">"Agee started CovertAction Magazine (originally named
CovertAction Information Bulletin) in 1978 with Louis Wolf, William
Schaap, Ellen Ray, James and Elsie Wilcott, William Kunstler, and
Michael Ratner."</span>

Out of the 8 people listed as founders of CAIB, Philip Agee, James
Wilcott, and Elsie Wilcott were all former CIA agents. At least 4 out of
the remaining 5 people were Jews, and the one person I'm not sure of is
Ellen Ray, who was married to one of the Jews.

<p>So CAIB seems like an 80s version of The Grayzone, which is another
pro-Russian leftist conspiracy publication based in DC. The Grayzone
author Kit Klarenberg said: <span class="quote">"Did you know that all
of my coworkers (bar one) at The Grayzone, including its founder and

<hr />
<p>In a Guardian article in December 1985, Seale seems to have
speculated that HIV was created by the Soviets, and not by the Americans
like he later claimed in the Sunday Express article in October 1986:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A second important disseminator of the KGB's HIV bioweapons theory in
the US and Europe, also cited in the new LG article, was the English
physician John Seale. He, too, was unaware of his role.[101] Seale had
served as a witness for the thesis of the LaRouche magazine <span
class="quote">"Executive Intelligence Review,"</span> according to which
the AIDS epidemic in the West only brought advantages to the closed
societies of the East, as they were supposedly able to isolate
themselves well. Nevertheless, at this time, Seale still believed in the
hypothesis of the American virologist Myron <span
class="quote">"Max"</span> Essex of the Harvard School of Public Health,
according to which HIV arose naturally in Africa through the
transmission of a similar virus from vervet monkeys to humans.[102]
However, Zapevalov's article and Soviet propaganda in general had led
him to the conclusion in the autumn of 1985 that the virus must be of
artificial origin.[103] He now claimed that HIV was probably was created
through the genetic manipulation of the Visna virus, a retrovirus in
sheep. Although Seale himself considered the Soviet Union rather than
the USA to be the country producing the <span
class="quote">"artificial"</span> virus,[104] he was quoted in a
broadcast of the Moscow Radio World Service in December 1985[105] and
again in 1986 in the Literaturnaya Gazeta on the alleged artificial
origin of the virus.[106] However, Seale continued to accuse the Soviet
Union of manufacturing the virus and supported a ballot initiative by
LaRouche in California to isolate AIDS patients from society.[107]</p>

<p>Footnotes 101 and 104 referred to an article by Andrew Veitch titled
<span class="quote">"Germ of Doubt"</span> published in The Guardian on
December 20th 1985.</p>
<p>Footnote 103 refers to Seale's response to the letter published in
the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, where Seale wrote about
the two articles published in Literaturnaya Gazeta, and then he wrote:
<span class="quote">"These Soviet articles led me to consider seriously
the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have been
man-made."</span>

<p>The KGB explained to the Bulgarian comrades that since 1985 it had
<span class="quote">"carried out a series of activities"</span> on this
topic together <span class="quote">"with the German [...]
colleagues."</span>[109] The HV A had been commissioned by the KGB to
make its own <span class="quote">"scientific"</span> contribution to the
campaign.[110] The organizational work was undertaken by Section 1 of
the HV A, Department X (HV A/X/1), which was responsible for active
measures intended to provoke or intensify differences between the USA
and its NATO allies (OVO <span class="quote">"Axis"</span>, XV 173/72),
promote disarmament and the peace movement in the West (OVO <span
class="quote">"Mars"</span>, XV 1971/75), and mobilize states in the
Third World against the USA (OVO <span class="quote">"Forward"</span>,
XV 3741/73).[111] Although the HV A had already begun its work in 1985,
according to the KGB, Ingo Dams of the HV A/X/1 only initiated a
corresponding object operation (OVO) <span class="quote">"Denver"</span>
on July 17, 1986.[112]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At a meeting with his Bulgarian colleagues in September 1986, the
deputy head of HV A/X, Wolfgang Mutz, claimed that <span
class="quote">"Denver"</span> constituted a <span
class="quote">"significant part of the AM of the department [HV
A/X]."</span>[114] The study mentioned - <span class="quote">"a major
study with scientific value,"</span> according to Mutz - was already
finished.[115] It proves, according to Mutz, that <span
class="quote">"AIDS is a result of a biological weapon of the
USA"</span> and that it <span class="quote">"was and is being used by
them [i.e., the HV A] in various AMs around the world."</span>
Furthermore, the Americans wanted <span class="quote">"a copy from the
author."</span>[116] The study described by Mutz as part of the <span
class="quote">"Denver"</span> process could only refer to the manuscript
<span class="quote">"AIDS - Nature and Origin"</span>[117] by Professor
emeritus Jakob Segal, his wife Lilli, and chemist Ronald Dehmlow. The
brief description of the content fits exactly with Segal's study. It was
translated into English. The study (<span class="quote">"AIDS - Its
Nature and Origin"</span>)[118] had already been distributed during the
summit of the Non-Aligned States in Harare in September 1986 as part of
a brochure entitled <span class="quote">"AIDS USA-home made evil, NOT
imported from AFRICA."</span>[119] A week before Mutz's meeting with the
Bulgarians, a diplomat from the US Embassy in East Berlin had asked the
Segals for a copy of their study.[120] This study and the Segals'
further work on AIDS were discussed by the KGB and the HV A during their
exchange with their Bulgarian colleagues as part of the OVO <span

<p>In 1953, they emigrated from France to East Berlin on orders from
Moscow. Jakob Segal, who was appointed professor at Humboldt University,
founded the Institute for General Biology there in 1953.[147] After
their move, Captain Heinz Kairies from Department 2 of Department VI of
the Stasi, which was responsible for the security and operational
processing of nuclear research facilities in the GDR, contacted
them.[148] Based on the meeting, at which Segal passed on information
about Western and East German scientists in nuclear research, Kairies's
superior demanded: <span class="quote">"Prepare S.[egal] as a GI.
Further strengthen contact. give orders."</span>[149] Both Segal[150]
and his wife Lilli[151] were then considered by Kairies as contact
persons (KP) in the sense of <span class="quote">"trustworthy
citizens"</span> of the GDR <span class="quote">"who are approached to
solve specific tasks"</span>.[152] According to Kairies, both Jakob and
Lilli Segal offered to collect secret information for him.[153] On
November 5, 1955, Kairies received an order from the <span
class="quote">"Comrade Advisor"</span> not to to hold further meetings
with Jakob Segal because the KGB was working with him.[154] This note
is, to date, the only evidence in the BStU archives of a KGB connection
to Segal. Despite the Soviet advisor's instructions, Kairies met again
with <span class="quote">"KP Prof. Segal"</span> on November 21,
1955.[155] The next verifiable meeting was not until May 22, 1957.[156]
After further meetings in 1958 and 1959,[157] Segal was finally
registered in December 1959 by an officer named Jahn of Section 4 of
Department VI, which was responsible for research and development
facilities, as secret informant <span class="quote">"Hae[c]kel"</span>
(Reg. No. 15405/60).[158] This demonstrates a general willingness of the
Segals to secretly[159] collaborate with the MfS and KGB.</p>

been mentioned only in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a meeting with Kairies on March 10, 1955, Segal spoke of his
previous work for <span class="quote">"the enlightenment"</span> until
1945 in France and offered to establish contact between the MfS
(Kairies: <span class="quote">"us"</span>) and scientists who had
possessed plans for a nuclear reactor. At the same meeting, he also
suggested that the MfS (Kairies: <span class="quote">"we"</span>) <span
class="quote">"stage a car accident"</span> in order to <span
class="quote">"eliminate"</span> a scientist with alleged Nazi
connections. Captain Kairies, Dept. VI: Report concerning discussion

she would also attach great importance to speaking with us."</span>
Segal attested to her worth as a source: <span class="quote">"His wife
often visits the wives of other scientists and is now serving as an
interpreter at the International Trade Union Congress."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term translated as <span class="quote">"the enlightenment"</span>
was <span class="quote">"die Aufklärung"</span>, which was a term used
to refer to Stasi's department HV A (<span
class="quote">"Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung"</span>, Main Directorate for
Reconnaissance). However the department did not yet exist in 1945, and
<span class="quote">"die Aufklärung"</span> can also mean <span
class="quote">"the intelligence"</span>, so I don't know if it referred
to Soviet intelligence, or communist intelligence networks in general,
or something else.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob Segal displayed the same mixture of ideological loyalty and
stubbornness in his scientific work. For example, in the 1950s, he was
one of the strongest advocates of the Stalinist line in biology in the
GDR, which was shaped by Trofim Lysenko's dogma that hereditary
characteristics of cultivated plants are determined by the environment
and not by genes. Lysenkoism violated all the fundamentals of genetics
even in the Stalin era and was controversial in the GDR, where genetics
was still tolerated and taught despite the official political line.[163]
Segal was excommunicated in 1958 by the SED party organ <span
class="quote">"Neues Deutschland"</span> for his text <span
class="quote">"The Dialectical Method in Biology"</span>, because, among
other things, he made a <span class="quote">"contribution to our
ideological struggle"</span> by <span class="quote">"engaging in the
false theory of <span class="quote">'science as
itself'</span>"</span>.[164] Professor Hans-Alfred Rosenthal, Director
of the Institute of Virology at the Charité Hospital in East Berlin,
later claimed that Segal continued to support Lysenko's ideas -
including the non-existence of genes - even after Lysenko himself had
abandoned them.[165] A natural science that was not subordinate to
ideology or did not serve it seemed inconceivable to Segal.</p>

<hr />
<p>An informant with the code name <span class="quote">"Albert

which was before Zapevalov's article had been published:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Erika Hickel, the <span class="quote">"chief genetic engineering
critic"</span> of the Green Party, spoke before the Bundestag in January
1985 about the artificial production of the AIDS virus.[177] An IMS
named <span class="quote">"Albert Heim"</span> also advocated the theory
of artificial production of the virus in Fort Detrick to the Stasi as
early as September 1985.[178] Another East German scientist, the
biochemist Samuel Mitja Rapoport, wanted to publish an article about the
alleged origin of HIV in Fort Detrick in the GDR press in November
1985.[179]</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>According to current knowledge, Segal began his AIDS research in the
summer of 1985.[180] Already in early October 1985 - i.e., before
Zapevalov's article - he wrote privately about <span
class="quote">"suspicions [...] that AIDS originated in the US research
center for biological warfare, Fort Detrick, through genetic
manipulation."</span></p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The MfS was able to learn a lot about Segal's research from <span
class="quote">"Nils"</span>, as he was the graduate chemist Ronald
Dehmlow, the aforementioned co-author of Segal's thesis. Dehmlow had
known Jakob Segal since 1978. As a student at Humboldt University, he
began researching ultraviolet irradiation (UVB) and oxygen therapy (HOT)
with Segal.[188] He continued this joint research, now also on AIDS, at
the People's Police Hospital (KHdVP) in Berlin. Dehmlow had been known
to the Stasi for some time. During his studies, from 1975 to February
1984, he was registered by HV A/XI/6 as IM <span
class="quote">"Niels"</span>.[189] Shortly after his appointment to the
KHdVP, he was contacted by the staff of HA VII/7[190] and from December
1984 as IM candidate <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> (now without the
<span class="quote">"e"</span>)[191] and from June 1986 as IMS <span
class="quote">"Nils"</span> (Reg. No. XV 2987/86)[192]. Although the
officers of HA VII/7 <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> were primarily
responsible for securing their area of responsibility - i.e. the
government hospital - to spy on his colleagues,[193] they repeatedly
received reports and documents from Dehmlow about the Segals' AIDS
research, even though they had absolutely no interest in it.[194] As he
himself recalls, Dehmlow met with Jakob Segal every one to two weeks to
discuss the Segals' research on AIDS. Because of these regular
conversations and his translation assistance for the English version of
the study, Jakob Segal would have named him as a co-author of the
study.[195]</p>
<p>The purpose of Segal's AIDS research was not purely scientific from
the outset. As mentioned above, Jakob Segal did not believe in a natural
science detached from communist ideology. In a conversation with Dehmlow
and his superior, the Medical Director of the KHdVP, Reinhard Uhlig, in
June 1986, he admitted that his research was also intended to serve
<span class="quote">"propaganda purposes."</span> Such a use was in
keeping with his then-current contact with Axen, who was responsible for
foreign propaganda. Segal agreed with Uhlig that Dehmlow's name should
not be mentioned in such propaganda cases.[196] In the version of his
study that appeared in the Harare brochure, Segal adhered to the
agreement. The only change to the text was the deletion of Dehmlow's
name; all that remained of him was a telltale comma after the names of
the two Segals.[197]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>On July 31, 1986, Dehmlow, as IMS <span class="quote">"Nils,"</span>
urgently reported to his commanding officer, Lt. Axel Theisinger, that
Segal had <span class="quote">"deconspired"</span> to him. In a
discussion with Dehmlow about his AIDS research, he had stated that
<span class="quote">"the comrades in security had advised him to do
so."</span> Until then, Segal had always referred to the <span
class="quote">"Party"</span> as his client. Theisinger continued: <span
class="quote">"The IMS [i.e., Dehmlow] recognized [...] that the professor
might have been in contact with the <span class="quote">'friends'</span>
[i.e., the KGB] or the MfS."</span>[202] Theisinger, for his part, knew
exactly for whom Segal was conducting his research at this time. He
noted that Segal <span class="quote">"had been positively registered for
the HV A and was conducting AIDS research on behalf of the Central
Committee of the SED, Comrade Axen, and the HV A and was undertaking
trips in this context to the NSW. The service unit that had positively
registered Segal was, however, the only one."</span>[203] not the HV
A/X, but Section 5 of Department XIII in the Science and Technology
Sector of the HV A (HV A/SWT/XIII/5).[204] The phrase <span
class="quote">"positively recorded"</span> was used in the MfS to
describe a person who worked for the MfS.[205]</p>
<p>For the HV A/X, Mutz informed his Bulgarian counterpart in September
1986 that the HV A/X was collaborating <span class="quote">"with the
operational department on the problem [AIDS]"</span> in the creation of
disinformation.[206] For espionage activities in the area of AIDS and
biotechnology or genetic engineering, the responsible <span
class="quote">"operational department"</span> was the department HV
A/SWT/XIII/5 under the leadership of Lutz Thielemann.[207] He was the
superior of Lieutenant Colonel Dieter van de Sand, for whom Jakob Segal
was registered. Lilli Segal was also registered by HV A/SWT/XIII/5.[208]
The <span class="quote">"security"</span> advice to Jakob Segal will
have been sent via the registering unit, HV A/SWT/XIII/5.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Although Jakob Segal demonstrably knew of the MfS's interest in his
research, the surviving files of the HV A in the BStU archives contain
no details about his positive registration by the HV A/SWT/XIII/5.
Because both Segals were registered by the HV A, there must also have
been index cards for them in the HV A index. However, the corresponding
files are missing from the BStU's <span class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span>
database.[227]</p>
<p>[227] If the Segals were registered as Soviet or French citizens, it
is possible that the CIA did not hand over the corresponding cards in
<span class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span> to the German government.
According to CIA guidelines, only copies of card indexes on German
individuals in the former HV A card index in the Rosenholz files were
handed over to the Federal Republic. See Müller-Enbergs: <span
class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span> (note 11), p. 52. It is also possible,
however, that the cards for the couple were removed from the card index
by the HV A earlier or destroyed. One can only speculate as to what
happened to the cards.</p>

<p>The fact that an interview between Stefan Heym and Jakob Segal was
published in the West Berlin newspaper <span class="quote">"taz"</span>
in February 1987, however, was due to the assistance of the HV A, as

</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MfAA), for its part, announced that
foreign journalists were not required to obtain permits to conduct
interviews with the Segals. The official reason: Both were retired
professors and therefore did not need to apply for a permit.[260]
However, for most ordinary pensioners in the GDR, such freedom of speech
did not apply to Western media. The SED (Social Democratic Party of
Germany) and the State Security Service (Stasi) evidently wanted to
support the international dissemination of Segal's thesis by all
means.</p>
<p>In private, however, the Segals not only complained about their <span
class="quote">"publication ban"</span> in the GDR.[261] They also
portrayed themselves as if they were on their own when it came to
potential publications of their thesis and journalistic activities in
Western countries. In April 1987, Lilli Segal even claimed that they had
to organize and finance their lecture tours to West Germany
themselves.</p>

<p>After the article in the <em>Sunday Express</em>, for example, the
Segals were contacted by the Indian journalist Kunhanandan Nair.[273]
Nair had been an accredited correspondent for the Indian newspapers
<em>Blitz</em> and <em>Patriot</em> in East Berlin for many years,[274]
which were known for publishing Soviet disinformation.[275] Nair was
also a fixture for HV A. In the run-up to the summit in Harare, HV A/X
had written a book that <span class="quote">"exposed"</span> and harshly
criticized the CIA's policies regarding the Non-Aligned Movement and the
Third World in general, using a mixture of facts and disinformation
theories from the KGB and the Eastern <span class="quote">"brother
agencies."</span>[276] The book was alternately referred to by HV A/X as
an active measure, <span class="quote">"mirror"</span>[277] or <span
class="quote">"jungle"</span>[278]. At an international press conference
on August 21, 1986 in New Delhi, where the Executive Committee of the
Non-Aligned Movement was meeting in preparation for the summit in
Harare, the book <em>Devil and his Dart: How the CIA is Plotting in the
Third World</em>. Nair appeared as the author of the book,[279] which
was subsequently distributed by the HV A during the summit in
Harare.[280]</p>
<p>Following his success in Harare and the article in the Sunday
Express, Nair now interviewed Jacob Segal. Although the interview first
appeared in Blitz on July 2, 1987, under the title <span
class="quote">"AIDS - A US Military Monster: Yankee Business, not Monkey
Business,"</span> it had already been published earlier in the Nairobi
Sunday Times without naming the author and was reprinted in the
Senegalese newspaper Le Devoir.[281] In India, an English version of
Segal's study, along with Nair's interview, was published in book form
in 1989.[282]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of 1986, a freelance West German journalist based in
Brussels, Heimo Claassen, also contacted Jakob Segal. As a journalist,
he reported not only on politics in Brussels, primarily within the
European Community, but also on developments in Africa, where he
traveled frequently. According to his own statement, his interest in the
origin of AIDS arose during a trip to Zaire in 1984.[283] In 1963, the
HV A had created the IM file <span class="quote">"Joachim"</span> (XV

verifiably recorded 40 information deliveries that it traced back to

cases as sources of outgoing information to the East German party and
state leadership. The incoming and outgoing information mainly dealt
with topics of European integration and the European Community from a

<p>One gets the impression that Heym was only able to offer his
interview with Segal in the Federal Republic because HV A/SWT/XIII was
working behind the scenes. Heym was constantly monitored and frequently
hindered in his work as a writer by HA XX/9 of the MfS, which pursued
him in the Operational Procedure (OV) <span
class="quote">"Diversant."</span>[300] Without further explanation, HA
XX/9 could have prevented the publication of the interview in the West.
But Heym's contact with the Segals led to Tustanowski, the officer in HA
XX/9 responsible for the OV <span class="quote">"Diversant,"</span>
inquiring about HV A/SWT's jurisdiction over the Segals. On October 28,
1986, he met with van de Sand to learn more about the meetings between
the Segals and the Heyms. If van de Sand had not already made it clear
at that time, Colonel Jesse, Head of Department of HV A/SWT/XIII,
informed by November 12th at the latest that HV A had an <span
class="quote">"operational interest [...] in ensuring that Prof. Segal's
thesis that the AIDS virus is a product of American biological weapons
research is spreading in NSW."</span>[301]</p>
<p>In other words, HA XX/9 was to take no action to prevent the
publication of the Heym-Segal interview. Subsequently, HA XX informed
the Deputy Minister of State Security, Rudi Mittig, of HV A's <span
class="quote">"operational"</span> concern to have Heym's interview with
Segal published in the West.[302]</p>
<p>Because Heym hadn't managed to publish his interview with Segal even
after months, HV A/X provided some help behind the scenes. Joachim
Nölte, a major and officer on special assignment (OibE) of HV
A/X/4,[303] working under the alias of an employee in the press
department of the GDR Foreign Ministry, informed Arno Widmann of the
<span class="quote">"taz"</span> newspaper that Stefan Heym had a <span
class="quote">"bombshell story"</span> about AIDS. For Heym, Widmann's
contact in early 1987, after so many disappointments, must have been a
relief. At Heym's request, Widmann promised to print the interview in
its entirety.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>One week after the publication in the <span

<p>Stefan Heym campaigned for Johannes Mario Simmel's novel to be
published in East Germany:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simmel even called Heym to express his concerns, whereupon Heym
defended Segal's thesis.[336] Later, Heym would campaign for the
publication of the novel in the GDR, not least because he saw in it
<span class="quote">"the misanthropic and contemptuous policies and
practices of imperialism"</span> - also in the area of <span
class="quote">"genetic warfare"</span> - were exposed.[337]</p>

<p>Segal's thesis was <span class="quote">"below high school

particularly <span class="quote">"of the utmost
primitiveness."</span>[339]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As IM <span class="quote">"Fritz Steiner,"</span> and later as
department head in the Central Committee of the SED, Seidel worked
closely with the MfS and Soviet government agencies in defending Soviet
psychiatry against accusations and condemnation in the World Psychiatric
Association for political abuse.[345] Even before the AIDS problem
emerged, Seidel had experience in helping the MfS and Moscow with joint
projects.</p>
<p>After his conversation with the Stasi, Seidel warned the scientists
Geissler and Rosenthal. Geissler recalled: <span class="quote">"If we
publish this, people would have to assume we were conducting CIA
business."</span>[346] Jakob Segal later wrote of a compromise whereby
neither he nor his numerous critics in East German science were allowed
to publish on the origin of the AIDS virus in the GDR.[347] Seidel, the
Stasi, and Segal also wanted to prevent East German scientists outside
the GDR from publishing criticisms of Segal's thesis. For this reason,
and because of the popularization of his thesis outside the GDR, Segal
can be considered a beneficiary of both the Stasi and the Central
Committee of the SED.</p>
<p>But the GDR's AIDS experts neither gave up their private criticism of
Segal nor their attempts to overturn the Central Committee's publication
ban. Sönnichsen, for example, explained to an MfS informant shortly
after Seidel's decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an undisputed fact that Professor Segal has backing; otherwise,
it would be impossible for him to operate unhindered in this way. He is
a Soviet citizen (with a passport), but has lived in the GDR for about
30 years and now travels around as a pensioner. Professor Sönnichsen's
opinion: Whoever backs him must discipline him.[348]</p>

<p>Ronald Dehmlow was commissioned by the Stasi to write a rebuttal to

<p>The newspaper [<em>Neue Zeit</em>] became a platform for opponents of

the newspaper quoted Geissler as saying that he had <span
class="quote">"vigorously"</span> rejected the claim that <span
class="quote">"the HIV virus, the AIDS pathogen, was created through
genetic manipulation."</span>[351] The HV A switched to defense. It
commissioned Dehmlow, alias <span class="quote">"Nils,"</span> via HA
VII/7, to prepare an article for the <span class="quote">"Neue
Zeit"</span> newspaper, which it described as a <span
class="quote">"counter-speech to Prof. Rosenthal"</span> should have
served. Dehmlow fulfilled the order in December 1987,[352] but the
article was apparently never published in the <span class="quote">"Neue
Zeit."</span>[353]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While there is no documentary evidence for the years 1985 to 1986
that would prove that the MfS supported the Segals and their research
and lecture activities, the situation is different for the period after
1987.</p>
<p>The first evidence of such assistance dates back to a meeting between
Dehmlow (IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span>) and his commanding
officer in HA VII/7, Theisinger, and with Thielemann from HV A/
SWT/XIII/5 on 27 August 1987. During this meeting, Thielemann explicitly
commissioned Dehmlow to provide <span class="quote">"professional and
scientific support to Prof. Segal."</span> Furthermore, Thielemann
tasked <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> with developing <span
class="quote">"scientifically sound counterarguments against the common
theory"</span> of the artificial production of the AIDS pathogen through
genetic engineering and the <span class="quote">"checking of
Prof. Segal's environment for possible enemy attacks as well as for
possible persons,[359] which support the above theory"</span>.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Thielemann even offered Dehmlow a new position at an
institute of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Buch. The position would
have involved the IM being taken over by HV A/SWT/XIII/5. However,
Dehmlow, supported by Theisinger, declined.[360] The job offer was
presumably the HV A/SWT/XIII/5's reaction to Dehmlow's growing
professional problems. His position at the People's Police Hospital
became increasingly difficult as a result of the harsh criticism of
Segal's thesis at the colloquium at the Charité in November 1986.[361]
One of Dehmlow's superiors had decided after the colloquium that Dehmlow
should generally cease his research on <span class="quote">"all sorts of
unimportant problems, such as AIDS, UVB, etc."</span> at the KHdVP and
his collaboration <span class="quote">"with the senile old Professor
Segal."</span>[362] The superior wanted Dehmlow's labor to be used for
his own research project.[363] He even claimed to Dehmlow that <span
class="quote">"the Enlightenment"</span> - i.e., the HV A - had
instructed him <span class="quote">"to slow down Segal and especially me
[Dehmlow], we had already caused enough damage - through our activities
we had exposed a source of <span class="quote">'A'</span> who was very
close to the situation."</span>[364] Dehmlow then replied to his
superior that <span class="quote">"Prof. Segal's activities are covered
by Comrade Axen at home and abroad."</span>[365]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>From April 1988, Dehmlow was able to devote himself fully to Segal's
research and other assignments from HV A/SWT/XIII/5. He became the head
of a research center for medical biophysical chemistry, which
corresponded exactly to his ideas. He reported to the GDR Deputy
Minister of Health, Ulrich Schneidewind. Thielemann indicated to
Theisinger that he had helped to create the position.[378] When Dehmlow
took up his new position, Thielemann officially took over the file on
IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> from Theisinger and handed it over
to van de Sand shortly thereafter.[379] Jakob Segal was employed under
Dehmlow as the <span class="quote">"scientific director"</span> of the
research center, and his wife Lilli as a <span
class="quote">"documentation consultant."</span>[380] Jakob Segal wrote
in May 1988 to an acquaintance: <span class="quote">"We were promised
generous funding for staff, equipment, and devices, and we began very
slowly and carefully to look for young, interested people."</span>[381]
According to Lilli Segal in an interview with <span
class="quote">"taz,"</span> the new research center would conduct <span
class="quote">"fundamental AIDS research."</span>[382] The new
arrangement corresponded to Dehmlow's plan.[383] It made van de Sand's
work easier because he knew that Jakob Segal, whom he had <span
class="quote">"positively identified,"</span> Lilli Segal, and the IM
<span class="quote">"Nils,"</span> whom he had taken over, were working
in the same environment. He could more easily pass on information to
them and more easily collect information from and about them.</p>

<p>Following Zapevalov's article, which allegedly suggested a high

the Honduran parliament to relocate American military bases to isolated
areas so that soldiers would not spread the virus among the local
population.[413] In May 1986, it reported on alleged concerns in other
countries that <span class="quote">"the USA had not taken effective
steps to initiate quarantine measures against the spread of AIDS outside
the USA."</span> In this context, it pointed to public appeals in Japan,
where ships of the American fleet were to be kept away from Japanese
ports for fear of infection with the AIDS pathogen.[414] The KGB

calling for the closure of American bases in Seoul because of the
alleged threat of AIDS.</p>

<p>The propaganda in the Soviet press about the alleged American origin

to a meeting by the Soviet embassy in East Berlin. The cultural attaché

colleagues in Sofia for further use in active measures. The article,

<p>Wolfgang Mutz was the deputy head of HV A/X, and Hans Pfeiffer was

the USA and its NATO allies"</span>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>During their visit to Bulgaria a year earlier, Mutz and Pfeifer had
already spoken of the film project as part of the <span
class="quote">"De-trick"</span> operation. It was said at the time that
HV A/X had requested <span class="quote">"the production of a
film."</span>[449] The film was <span class="quote">"a matter for their
operational channel (illegal)."</span> They continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The film that the comrades in West Germany are preparing about the
AIDS problem will be a work of their operative channel (illegally). This
channel has already signed a contract with West German television. They
are taking every measure to ensure that no one notices that the GDR has
any connection to the film, even though they have to provide financial
support. The interview that Prof. Segal's presentation in October of
this year is intended to be the culmination of this effort. [...] It will
be a documentary in the style of English investigative crime films. The
arguments will be presented objectively, with one exception: It will
show that the Americans are spreading disinformation about AIDS and that
they are abusing technological interventions.[450]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1989, Mutz and Pfeifer further reported that the film had been
produced <span class="quote">"by a private film company in cooperation
with the West German Broadcasting Corporation."</span> The HV A/X had
even subsidized the <span class="quote">"production of the film with a
certain sum."</span> <span class="quote">"The West German side
[presumably the West German Broadcasting Corporation] paid 80,000 DM for
the production of the film, and the German comrades paid 40,000
DM."</span> Interestingly, the <span class="quote">"Soviet comrades had
proposed paying 60,000 DM for the film, but The German comrades have
rejected this participation."</span> There is now a possibility that the
film's distribution could recoup the production costs. <span
class="quote">"Currently,"</span> according to Mutz and Pfeifer, <span
class="quote">"the film is being distributed by producers in West
Germany for 10,000 DM and for African and Third World countries for
5,000 DM per copy."</span> They handed over both a German and an English
version of the film to the Bulgarian <span
class="quote">"comrades."</span>[451] HV A/X asked the Bulgarian
comrades for help in distributing the film in Western and developing
countries. The Bulgarians suggested the services of one of their best
channels of the 1980s, the agent <span class="quote">"Shiwa,"</span>
director of an Indian institute for the Non-Aligned Movement.[452]</p>
<p>According to Mutz and Pfeifer's description, the film co-financed by
HV A/X can only be <span class="quote">"AIDS - the African
Legend"</span> by West German documentary filmmaker Malte Rauch and
journalist Heimo Claassen. The latter, as already mentioned, was managed
by HV A/X/1 in the IMA case <span class="quote">"Joachim."</span> After
Pfeifer was promoted to head of department, Dams, still responsible for
<span class="quote">"Denver,"</span> took over the IMA case <span
class="quote">"Joachim"</span> - that is, at the time of Claassen's film
project.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal promoted false treatments for AIDS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal even put forward several suggestions for alternative therapies.
In a 1990 article co-authored with his old research colleague Dehmlow,
he cautiously suggested that ultraviolet radiation (UVB) could <span
class="quote">"delay or prevent the infection of new cells and the
development of disease,"</span> even in the case of HIV infection.[508]
Segal repeated this <span class="quote">"therapeutic approach"</span> in
his own book <span class="quote">"AIDS: Cell Physiology, Pathology and
Therapy"</span> in 1992.[509] One such possibility had already been
mentioned by Dehmlow in 1987 - as IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span>
in a report for the Stasi on UVB and oxygen therapy. He had also pointed
out the economic advantages of the potential, successful treatment of
AIDS and other diseases with UVB therapy. The GDR would have been able
to carry out such a therapy without expensive imports gfrom Western
countries.[510] Segal had already wanted to treat HIV-infected patients
with UVB during the GDR era, but this was rejected by Seidel.[511]</p>
<p>After the end of the GDR, Dehmlow increasingly specialized in such
alternative therapies and even became president of the Society for Ozone
and Oxygen Applications in Berlin.[512] However, UVB and HOT found no
support in the Joint Federal Committee of Physicians and Health
Insurance Funds, which generally recognized <span class="quote">"no
reliable evidence for the benefit and medical necessity"</span> of their
use, without even mentioning AIDS.[513]</p>
<p>Segal saw other possibilities for early AIDS therapy in traditional
and natural remedies from Africa and Asia. Regarding the negative
results of tests with African medicinal plants against HIV infections in
the USA, he wrote - completely illogically and unscientifically: <span
class="quote">"If in America all patients in the late stages [of AIDS]
died, it was to be assumed that in Africa patients in earlier stages
survived to a high degree when treated with native medicinal
plants."</span> Good news also came from China: "And if in May 1995
Chinese doctors reported cures for AIDS with a natural remedy, this is
entirely in line with our expectations.[514]</p>
<p>But the <span class="quote">"new approach"</span> to AIDS therapy, on
which Segal particularly focused, looked something else entirely:
regular administration of small doses of aspirin in the early stages of
HIV infection.[515] In 1992, he explained: <span class="quote">"Aspirin
should [...] effectively inhibit HIV proliferation."</span>[516] He asked
hypothetically why doctors were not using aspirin to treat AIDS. His
answer was: <span class="quote">"Imagine: If the patient can now be
cured without having to go to the hospital with two aspirin tablets
daily, i.e., with pennies, then it is obvious that the doctors don't
like me, the pharmaceutical industry, and the USA don't like me
either."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Particularly traumatic for the proponents of Segal's thesis and
characteristic of its classification as a conspiracy theory was the fact
that the Segals could not provide any empirical evidence to support
their to prove the famous <span class="quote">"chain of
evidence."</span> For example, none of the US prisoners allegedly used
as guinea pigs for the Fort Detrick virus could ever be identified.
However, after 1989, there were two attempts in the field of fine art to
close this evidential gap, at least artistically. The first attempt came
in 1996 in the form of a novel entitled <span class="quote">"The
Vaccination,"</span> for which Rauch and Claassen wrote a foreword. The
novel, whose author remained anonymous, recounted the alleged experiment
at Fort Detrick and the fate of the prisoner guinea pigs after their
release. The anonymous author dedicated the novel to the so-called <span
class="quote">"masterminds"</span>: Claassen, Rauch, the Chirimuutas,
and the Segals.[526] Rauch and Claassen, for their part, wrote in the
foreword: <span class="quote">"The Segals, the Chirimuutas, and we in
our film could only show interim results of this research [on AIDS] [...]
- the whole picture is still far from clear."</span> The novel is <span
class="quote">"a welcome and inspiring next step toward understanding,
further thought, and hopefully, someday, even action."</span>[527] In
1997, WDR used the new novel as an opportunity to rebroadcast excerpts
from the film <span class="quote">"AIDS - the African Legend"</span>
along with interviews with the authors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The German title of the novel was <span class="quote">"Die
Impfung"</span>, and the authors were Johann Schulz and Juan Sherry,
which Selvage and Nehring indicated were pseudonyms.</p>
<p>Rauch and Claassen made the film <span class="quote">"AIDS - the
African Legend"</span> which was subsidized by HV A/X. Claassen was a
West German journalist living in Brussels, who was registered as a Stasi
informant with the codename <span class="quote">"Joachim"</span> in
1963. In 1983 his file was transfered to Hans Pfeifer, whose department
HV A/X oversaw operation Denver. Claassen provided information to Stasi
about African countries, and he said his interest in AIDS arose during a
trip to Zaire in 1984.</p>

<p>Ljungqvist was not the only one who continued to propagate Segal's
thesis alongside alternative therapies for AIDS in the 2000s. The
intellectual heir of Segal's thesis and its early therapy did the same:
its co-author Christoph Klug, a member of the Marxist-Leninist Party of
Germany (MLPD) and director of the MLPD-affiliated publishing house
<span class="quote">"Neuer Weg"</span> in Essen,[544] which published
the Segals' last books in the 1990s. The left-wing extremist[545] MLPD
used the Segals' conspiracy theory to promote, among other things, its
goal of <span class="quote">"an international socialist
revolution."</span>[546] Klug and the MLPD-affiliated support group
<span class="quote">"Neue Wege in der HIV-Therapie"</span> (FNW)
propagated Segal's thesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neuer Weg is the publishing house of the Marxist-Leninist Party of
Germany, which publishes the party's newspaper and books. Klug is no
longer listed as the director of Neuer Weg, but their website says he is
the former manager of Neuer Weg.

<p>Nevertheless, in 2004, the <span class="quote">"New Ways in HIV

study in Zimbabwe on the effectiveness of aspirin and selenium in HIV
therapy.[575] The warnings of the managing director of the German AIDS
Help (DAH), Hannelore Knittel, that the planned study, as presented, was
<span class="quote">"ethically unjustifiable,"</span> were ignored by
the association. Interestingly, three of the four study leaders in
Zimbabwe were FNW,[576] the same as in Armistead's 2001 study:
Dr. Marianne Thomsen from the non-governmental organization Humana
People-to-People International (HPtP) and Prof. EN Sibanda and
Dr. Graÿyna Stanczuk from the medical faculty of the University of
Zimbabwe. Both studies were viewed by HPtP as part of its own project to
combat AIDS in Africa, <span class="quote">"Total Control of the
Epidemic."</span>[577] The roots of HPtP in the Danish revolutionary
school reform movement <span class="quote">"Tvind"</span> of Maoist
Arndi Petersen[578] may have played a role in the FNW's decision to
co-finance the study. In the end, Thomsen declared the one-year <span

<p>A new reason for the renewed publicity controversy surrounding
Segal's thesis was aroused. The Duisburg hip-hop duo <span
class="quote">"Die Bandbreite"</span> was disinvited from the
Christopher Street Day (CSD) in Duisburg because they wanted to rap
their new song about AIDS. The lyrics reflected Segal's thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Do you believe the crap about the monkeys, the nasty green
monkeys?<br> The animals that their Zairian hunters first infected,<br>
SIV mutates, and the blacks bring it across the pond,<br> so that HIV 81
then reaches the USA via Haiti.<br> But it can't be that easy, as a
mistake can creep in,<br> because SIV and HIV have virtually no
similarities.</p>
<p>Doctor MacAthur [sic] in 69 asked the House of Representatives for
money<br> because the country needed a biological weapon for its
military.<br> And so it happened, the money went out and then Robert
Gallo showed up.<br> They say he discovered AIDS. False! The man built
AIDS. [...]<br> AIDS has the same morphology as the Visna virus, which
affects sheep,<br> the same molecular weight, and sixty percent genome
identical.</p>

<p>[...]</p>
<p>During his research, journalist Philipp Wahl learned that the <span
class="quote">"pseudo- scientific song"</span> had been commissioned by
the FNW.[587] The chairman of the FNW, Detlef Rohm, had given the duo
the paid commission and presented the song, including the corresponding
video on YouTube, at the very last general meeting of the association in
April 2012.[588] The last verse of the song makes the sponsorship
clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wojnarowicz calls for the implementation of the association's <span

<p>FNW was Klug's group <span class="quote">"Förderverein »Neue Wege in
der HIV-Therapie«"</span> (<span class="quote">"Support Association
<span class="quote">'New Approaches in HIV Therapy'</span>"</span>).</p>
<p>The rapper Marcel Wojnarowicz said that his song was based on an
antisemitic book about HIV and SARS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meier pointed out that Wojnarowicz cited a book by Wolfgang Eggert,
<span class="quote">"The Planned Epidemics: AIDS - SARS and Military
Genetic Research"</span> (2003), as a key source for the song, in
addition to a brochure by Klug. According to Meier, the book was
considered <span class="quote">"crude anti-Semitic propaganda."</span>
According to Eggert, HIV was developed by the US government at Fort
Detrick and passed on by the CIA to the Mossad. The Israeli secret
service then spread the virus in Africa through deliberately
contaminated blood transfusions. Behind everything, he claimed, was a
Jewish end-time cult sect.[590] Eggert wrote of a <span
class="quote">"biblical-apocalyptic project that extended into the
present: It is the possible creation of an artificial pathogen that will
destroy all races in the world - except for the genetically <span
class="quote">'purest'</span> Jewish core."</span>[591] In the book,
Eggert cites the writings of American conspiracy theorists on the
alleged spread of the virus in Africa by the WHO and, like them, named
the Polish-Jewish scientist Wolf Szmuness as a key figure. While
Szmuness, who emigrated from Poland to the USA in the early 1970s, was
alleged evidence of a communist conspiracy to spread AIDS for the
Strecker brothers, he served Eggert as proof of a Zionist world
conspiracy.[592]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 590 referred to a article by Marcus Meier titled <span
class="quote">"Wie links ist Paranoia?"</span>

<p>Selvage and Nehring also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wojnarowicz recalled that Klug's (MLPD) brochure entitled <span
class="quote">"AIDS in Africa"</span> also served as a source for the
lyrics. He stated on his website: <span class="quote">"Two completely
independent sources provided us with almost identical information about
the origin of the HIV virus. We also found support for the theses
presented in the video clip from the support association <span
class="quote">'New Ways in HIV Therapy'</span>."</span>[600] Contrary to
appearances, however, the two sources were not completely independent of
each other, because both Eggert[601] and Klug[602] took Segal's thesis
as their starting point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 600 referred to the website of Wojnarowicz's rap duo.
[<a href=http://www.diebandbreite.de/videoclip-aids/>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>diebandbreite.<wbr>de/<wbr>videoclip-<wbr>aids/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>Footnote 601 referred to pages 23, 47, 49-52, and 77-82 in Eggert's
book <span class="quote">"Die geplanten Seuchen: AIDS - SARS und die
militärische Genforschung"</span>. It might seem odd that an antisemitic
book would be based on a theory by a communist Jew, if the antisemitic
movement was not thoroughly infiltrated by plants serving the Jews and
communists.</p>
<hr />
<p>Members of Klug's group said that HIV vaccines should be tested in
sheep, presumably because the members of the group still held on to
Segal's view that HIV was derived from visna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="quote">"Rainbow,"</span> for example, reprinted an
interview with Eggert about his book in 2004.[604] In the introduction
to the interview, FNW members Ralf Bogen and Reiner Seybold, then also
managing director of the Action Alliance against AIDS, justified the
publication as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eggert critically examines Prof. Gallo's widespread dogma that HIV
was originally a natural monkey virus from Africa. [...] The clear
clarification of the HIV origin question is important for the rapid
development of an effective AIDS vaccine. For the necessary vaccination
trials, the correct selection of suitable animal models [ie sheep!] is
important.[605]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of the MLPD, Mast reported positively in the <span
class="quote">"Red Flag"</span> in 2002 on the writings of US conspiracy
theorist Boyd E. Graves. Graves, as Mast emphasized, had <span
class="quote">"reconfirmed"</span> the Fort Detrick thesis.[609] But
according to Graves's account, the production and spread of AIDS around
the world was a joint program of the USA and the USSR to exterminate
Black people and homosexuals. He himself allegedly cured himself of AIDS
with colloidal silver - a cure whose effectiveness an Israeli
pharmaceutical company and an Israeli research institute allegedly
wanted to cover up.[610]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 609 referred to an article by Willi Mast published on the
website of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany.

Willi Mast was a member of FNV and MLPD who had collaborated with Segal
since 1988.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the writings of the Segals, Klugs, the FNW, and the
MLPD, including conspiracy theories and proposals for early AIDS
treatment, do not appear to have had the destructive consequences of the
activities of Duesberg and other AIDS deniers. The latter significantly
influenced Mbeki's policies. In contrast to Duesberg, the Segals were
always aware of the dangers of HIV and therefore supported <span
class="quote">"safe sex."</span>[617] During a lecture tour through
South Africa, Klug, as a member of the MLPD, together with its sister
party, the Communist Party of South Africa Marxist-Leninist (CPSA-ML),
took a stand against Mbeki's AIDS policy. As part of their <span
class="quote">"militant alliance"</span> for the introduction of Klug's
emergency program against AIDS in South Africa, they called for early
treatment with aspirin and the development of a p24-based vaccine, as
well as the immediate introduction of ARVs without profit for the
pharmaceutical industry. Klug and the FNW reject Duesberg's AIDS denial
as unscientific and false.[619]</p>

<p>In the paper Geissler stuck to his earlier view that Segal acted
independent of the Stasi, which is difficult to believe considering the
information Selvage and Nehring presented in their 2014 paper.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the entire series of papers by Geissler and
Selvage in chronological order, but like in the case of the earlier
papers, I again copied excerpts from the paper I saved as notes
below.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the same way that Boghardt was employed by Spy Museum in DC,
Selvage's coauthor Nehring was employed by Spy Museum Berlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selvage, although an American, was, and remains, employed as a
historian, researcher, and project leader at the BStU. Nehring as a
graduate student at Heidelberg University had been helpful to us during
our study; after graduation he had become Head of Research at the Spy
Museum Berlin, a privately owned exhibition <span
class="quote">"relaunched in July 2016 as the <span
class="quote">'German Spy Museum.'</span>"</span>[23]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In the archives of the Bulgarian state security service KOMDOS,
Christopher Nehring found a memo dated September 7th 1985 where the KGB
requested the KOMDOS to join the active measure concerning HIV. The
paper by Selvage and Nehring from 2014 only quoted excerpts of the memo,
so I wasn't sure if the visna virus was mentioned in other parts of the
memo or not, but Geissler now provided a nearly complete English
translation of the memo, which had no reference to visna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are undertaking a number of activities related to [AIDS]. ... The
goal of the activities is the creation of a (beneficial to us) belief
abroad that this disease is the result of an out-of-control secret
experiment with new types of biological weapons carried out by the U.S.
special forces and the Pentagon.</p>
<p>It would be desirable if you could engage in the realization of the
said activities through your means in the party, parliamentary, public
policy and journalist circles in the Western and develop ing nations by
advancing to the bourgeois press the following theses:</p>
<p>1. First appearing at the end of the 1970s in New York City, by 1985
AIDS has become one of the most dangerous diseases in the world.... [and]
has spread far beyond the USA borders: many incidents of AIDS infections
were reported practically in every country that imports blood donations
from the USA. The World Health Organization declared AIDS to be one of
the most dangerous diseases on the planet, noting that it threatens the
developing nations the most.</p>
<p>2. The press of developing nations, including India, already noted
facts proving the participation of the U.S. special forces and the
Pentagon in the creation and quick dispersal in the USA and then in
other countries of the AIDS disease. Judging from these reports, and
also from the level of interest by the American military in the AIDS
symptoms and the speed and geography of its dispersal, the most likely
inference is that this most dangerous disease is the result of yet
another experiment with new types of biological weapons carried out by
the Pentagon. It is confirmed further by the fact that in early phases
of the outbreak only certain groups of people were affected -
homosexuals, drug addicts, and immigrants from Latin America. The
American government immediately accused Haitian immigrants of bringing
AIDS into the USA and declared that AIDS is not dangerous to the <span
class="quote">"normal"</span> portion of the population. Yet in the next
two years it was shown that AIDS can be transmitted through saliva and
tears, and it turned out that even children can be infected.</p>
<p>3. Indirect evidence of the Pentagon involvement with the development
of the AIDS virus is that it was the military itself that has had the
most successful results in battling the disease. Military medical
centers in the USA, including <span class="quote">"USAMRIID - US ARMY
MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES"</span> in Fort
Detrick, state Maryland (FORT DETRICK, MD), in the most secretive
fashion have developed fairly effective methods for early detection of
the disease, its treatment in this early phase, and corresponding
medicinal therapies. This will limit the diffusion of AIDS among the US
military, drastically lowering fatal outcomes, that, obviously, affect
military readiness of the soldiers. At the same time, the Pentagon is
not hurrying to share its progress in this realm with the civilian
medical institutions, because it is precisely the sick AIDS patients who
are in civilian hospitals that the Pentagon specialists are using to
study the results of infecting people with AIDS.</p>
<p>Share your thoughts and potential suggestions with us as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Segal had begun to develop the HIV conspiracy theory by October 3rd
1985, and he had finished an early manuscrpt about the theory by January
1986:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No later than 3 October 1985 Segal had come to doubt the African
origin of HIV and mentioned <span class="quote">"strong indications that
AIDS evolved in the US research center for biological warfare in Fort
Detrick by genetic engineering."</span>[31] A first draft of his thesis
was ready by January 1986;[57] Segal's protégé and sometime coauthor
Ronald Dehmlow secretly shared parts of this thesis with HA VII/7, the
MfS department conducting counter-espionage at Dehmlow's place of
work.[58]</p>

<hr />
<p>People from Stasi were opposed to Segal's hypothesis and thought it
might harm the reputation of GDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An officer of the department responsible for counter-intelligence in
economic and scientific affairs informed other departments of the MfS,
including the Regional Administration East Berlin, that <span
class="quote">"[o]fficials of the ministry of Health as well as
Humboldt-University Berlin, who deal with the AIDS problem and with
homosexuality, share the opinion that Segal's claim is not tenable from
a scientific and medical view."</span>[106] Selvage and Nehring have not
mentioned this letter.</p>
<p>Major Dewitz of the Stasi's East Berlin Administration initiated a
comprehensive evaluation of Segal's claims.[107] Dewitz, too, in a
comprehensive four-page memorandum, concluded that <span
class="quote">"all GDR experts are convinced that Prof. Segal's theory
is untenable."</span> But that was a scientific consensus. What Dewitz
described next, though, was a political consensus, that Segal's
activities <span class="quote">"are considered to be politically
harmful"</span> and that spreading the myth generated <span
class="quote">"disadvantages for the GDR"</span> - <span
class="quote">"scientific disadvantages,... economic disadvantages... and
political disadvantages."</span>[108] Consequently, the Stasi, <span
class="quote">"Shield and Sword of the Party,"</span> should not support
but rather should suppress Segal's activities. Major Dewitz went on to
contemplate measures <span class="quote">"[t]o protect the esteem of the
GDR with appropriate measures"</span> by making Segal desist.[109]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At one point Segal claimed that Gallo had created HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greenwald referred to a Segal interview published in an Austrian
journal, Basta. In that interview Segal had not only repeated his
allegations but had also asserted that virologist Robert Gallo - along
with Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi a co-discoverer of HIV was
responsible for the creation of the AIDS agent through genetic
manipulation.[141] Later Segal explained that <span class="quote">"the
Pentagon simply purchased Gallo."</span>[142]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Segals may have been presented as French to downplay their ties
to the eastern bloc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September 1986 in <span class="quote">"Pentagon behind
AIDS?"</span> Moscow's New Times referred to <span class="quote">"French
scientists Jacob and Lily [sic] Segal."</span>[145] Later the GDR's
Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs described Jakob Segal as
French.[135,138] But the Ministry of State Security - the MfS or Stasi -
knew Segal was a citizen of the Soviet Union. USDoS also knew this:
<span class="quote">"Throughout the early and middle stages of the
disinformation campaign, Soviet-bloc media repeatedly misidentified
Segal as a French national."</span> USDoS assumed disinformation in
<span class="quote">"an effort to downplay his ties to the
G.D.R."</span> But USDoS also suggested not disinformation but
<em>misinformation</em>: <span class="quote">"Segal, who resides in East
Berlin but claims to have graduated from the Sorbonne in 1940, has been
repeatedly misidentified as a French researcher."</span>[146]</p>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have seen here only disinformation: an attempt to
hide Segal's ties to East Berlin ties that Segal himself made patently
obvious again and again. Pretending Segal was French, Selvage and
Nehring have proposed, would have been advantageous since <span
class="quote">"AIDS disinformation spread from the East ought to be
supported by <span class="quote">'Western

Loftus coauthored two of his three best-known books with the Jew Mark
Aarons, whose father was the head of the Communist Party of Australia
and a grandson of two founding members of the party. Loftus later became
the mentor of Adam Finnegan, wrote the foreword for Finnegan's book, and
provided Project Paperclip files to Finnegan. John Loftus is a former
military intelligence agent, who said that he learned about the history
of biowarfare from the publisher of his book, who was a former
high-level CIA agent.

already authored 20 novels, numerous screenplays, and various short
stories and children's books. His works had been translated into 25

<p>Around 1987, HVA X gave Segal material <span class="quote">"from
secret service circles"</span> on the 1969 congressional testimony of
Donald MacArthur, then deputy director of research and engineering in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In his testimony, MacArthur
stated that <span class="quote">"within a period of five to 10 years it
would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have
been acquired."</span> He elaborated further that <span class="quote">"A
research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed
in approximately five years at a total cost of $10
million."</span>[100]</p>
<p>For Segal, the MacArthur testimony was near-certain evidence that the
Pentagon had not only contemplated an HIV-type virus since 1969 but also
had gone through with the project within the 10-year time frame
MacArthur had suggested. Henceforth, MacArthur's testimony became a
cornerstone of Segal's conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>MacArthur's testimony is also frequently quoted by Nick the
Spacecat.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote that Segal later started to blame Gallo for creating
the virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his earlier publications and utterances, Segal had dispassionately
and largely accurately described Gallo's contribution to the
identification of HIV, but he sharply changed his tack in the late
1980s, when Gallo became the key figure in Segal's theory. In his final
years, Segal developed an apparent pathological hatred of Gallo as the
man personally responsible for creating AIDS, and he seized every
opportunity to lambast the American scientist.</p>
<p>In 1989, just one year before East Germany's demise, Segal went on a
lecture tour across West Germany. Even though the SED leadership had
avoided endorsing Segal and he did not travel as an official GDR
representative, his trip was inconceivable without the Politburo's
knowledge and approval. In his presentations, Segal touted his latest
piece of evidence - the MacArthur hearing of 1969 - and pilloried
Gallo.[103] According to the recollections of one of his listeners,
Segal referred to Gallo as <span class="quote">"a huge gangster"</span>
[ein ganz grosser Gangster] who was responsible for creating the
virus.[104]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Segal's last major accomplishment during the Cold War was the
publication in 1990 of his book <em>AIDS - die Spur führt ins
Pentagon</em> [<em>AIDS - the trail leads to the Pentagon</em>], which
incorporated the bits on Gallo and the MacArthur hearing into his
original thesis. The book was published by <em>Neuer Weg</em>, a
publishing house closely associated with the far-left, Maoist Marxist
Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick the Spacecat also claims that Gallo was involved in creating
HIV.</p>
<p>Neuer Weg is not only closely associated with the Marxist-Leninist
Party of Germany, but it is the party's publishing house, which
publishes the newspaper and literature of the party.

<p>A biography of Lilli Segal said:
[<a href=https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>convoi77.<wbr>org/<wbr>deporte_<wbr>bio/<wbr>segal-<wbr>lilli/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His second wife, Edith Albrecht, threatened to denounce Lilli to the
police as a communist, to make her leave the shared residence. Because
of the tightening restrictions for Jews in Germany, Lilli moved to
France in 1933 and studied at the Toulouse University of
Agriculture.</p>
<p>During her stay in Toulouse she met the student Jakob Segal, a
Lithuanian national, who was a member of the German Communist Party
(KPD). He had immigrated to France because of his involvement in the
communist <span class="quote">'Red Student Union'</span>. They married
on May 25, 1935 and Lilli was given Lithuanian citizenship by virtue of
the marriage, which made her a citizen of the Soviet Union from
1940.</p>
<p>Due to her non-German nationality, Lilli Segal was able to travel to
Germany without any difficulties after 1935. During these trips she took
on several missions for the KPD without being a member of the party.
These were among other things the housing of endangered comrades, the
production and distribution of leaflets, and courier activities. In
addition, she remained in contact with a group of Bavarian Catholic
officers who were opponents of the Hitler regime. They provided her with
money for political work.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of war, Lilli Segal worked in a laboratory in
Paris from 1937. She joined the French Communist Party, with which she
was regularly involved until the beginning of the war. Because they
feared that she was under surveillance by the Gestapo, the French
comrades broke off the connection with her.</p>
<p>When Germany occupied France, she left Paris and lived in Mende. In
the summer of 1943 party leaders decided to transfer Lilli Segal to the
same working group as her husband, because both had lived together for a
long time and worked in the same office.</p>
<p>From 1943 until her arrest she worked as a so-called liaison agent
for her husband, who worked at the technical headquarters of a party
section which dealt with transporting materials, as well as the contact
management of liaisons with the headquarters.</p>
<p>The persecution of party official Paul Grasse led the police to their
office in the summer of 1943. With the arrest of a number of German and
Austrian party comrades on November 23rd Paul Grasse also
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lilli Segal was also questioned by the French police (see picture
above) at the Prefecture de Police. She was not cooperative and was
arrested as a result. After a month, she was handed over by the French
police to the German run jail of Fresnes, where she remained until the
end of June 1944.</p>
<p>At the end of June, she was taken to Drancy, and after a month, on 31
July 1944, Lilli Segal was deported to Auschwitz in Convoi 77. In the
train, she made contact with two Austrian comrades; one of them was Anni
Sussmann, with whom she was transferred in November 1944 to a Labour
unit at Kratzau in the Sudetenland. (1)</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>After returning to France, Lilli Segal continued working for the
French Communist Party until 1947. (5) Since it became prohibited for
Soviet citizens to work for a political party abroad, she left France
together with her husband, Jakob Segal, and they emigrated to the German
Democratic Republic. From 1948 she worked in the GDR in various official
political organizations, e.g. as an interpreter. (1)</p>

1948 our Lithuanian passports with the consular stamp were transformed
into Soviet passports for use outside the USSR. When he gave us the
passports, the consul admonished us to refrain from all political
activity in France. He even criticized our membership in the union. But
we refused to resign from the union because our French colleagues were
counting on our support. We withdrew from all work for the Communist
Party and fortunately our reputations as resistance fighters and
anti-Fascists were so good that our friends and fellow workers did not
hold it against us. In autumn 1952 we were summoned again to the Soviet
consulate. The consul suggested that we resettle in the German
Democratic Republic. And so it came about that at Christmastime of that
year we flew to Berlin with André, age eleven and Michael, seven. Jascha
founded the Institute for General Biology and organized the first
courses in radiation biology and biophysics. During our first years in
Berlin I worked as a free lance translator and document expert. At that
time there were still very few trained French interpreters, thus my
services were in constant demand."</span>

<p>She appears to have produced disinformation about the Holocaust and
not only HIV. She claims that she was personally selected by Josef
Mengele when she arrived to Auschwitz, which is a common trope among
Auschwitz survivors. Like many Auschwitz survivors, she incorrectly said
that Mengele was tall. She also repeated the cliches that Mengele held a
whip in his hand, and that he was somehow elegant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone called out: <span class="quote">"Old people and women with
children to the right, women to the left."</span> SS men stood on the
platform and pushed us forward with their rifle butts. For the first
time we heard the commands that would accompany us throughout our entire
time in the camps: <span class="quote">"Move! Move! Faster! Stay in
line!"</span> Stumbling, we pressed forward, into the glare of the
spotlight, past an elegant, tall, dark-haired officer, who poked at the
marchers with the butt of his whip, directing them to the group of the
old people and children, or to the other side. Dr. Mengele! He was
whistling, quite audibly, a melody from Wagner's Goetterdaemmerung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his biography of Mengele, the Jewish mainstream historian David
Marwell wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Historian Zdenek Zofka notes that many survivors recall Mengele
speaking to them in Hungarian, a language he did not speak but which was
spoken by his colleagues, the pharmacist Viktor Capesius and the
physician Dr. Fritz Klein. <span class="quote">"Often Mengele would be
described as tall and blond, when he was only 5ft 8½ inches tall and
dark-haired."</span>[31] <span class="quote">"Almost all inmates"</span>
at Auschwitz, according to Zofka, maintain that they had been selected
by Mengele.</p>
<p>Hermann Langbein, a former Auschwitz inmate and author of the
authoritative <em>People in Auschwitz</em>, wrote of this phenomenon,
which he deemed the <span class="quote">"Mengele Effect,"</span> a
particular form of <span class="quote">"memory displacement"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a member of the SS is repeatedly named in public in connection
with especially monstrous deeds, it is possible that survivors will
project their experiences on to him. ... More than once I heard survivors
say that Mengele did this or that to them, even though Mengele had not
yet arrived in Auschwitz at the time. Olga Lengyel has described him as
a blonde angel, even though Mengele was a markedly dark-haired type. In
short, crimes of an anonymous SS physician were imputed to Mengele,
about whom people had read so many bad things. ...</p>
<p>Some well-known SS men have been positively idealized after the fact.
Thus Fania Fénelon has called Mengele a <span class="quote">"handsome
Siegfried,"</span> and Therese Chassaing writes, <span
class="quote">"Mengele is immaculate in his belted uniform, tall, with
shiny black boots that bespeak cleanliness, prosperity, and human
dignity."</span> Elie Wiesel mentions as one of Mengele's characteristic
attributes <span class="quote">"white gloves, a monocle, and the
rest."</span>[32]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Langbein saw Mengele <span class="quote">"almost every day in the
office of the SS infirmary where he was doing routine bureaucratic
work,"</span> and he claims that Mengele never struck him as either
attractive or elegant. He never saw him with a monocle. Doris Bergen,
describing the work of Israeli historian Na'ama Shik, wrote about the
<span class="quote">"so-called Mengele Effect,"</span> noting that
survivors' accounts decades after the fact could be shaped by what <span
class="quote">"they have read and heard in the meantime."</span>[33]</p>
<p>Geoffrey Hartmann, who wrote extensively on survivor testimony,
observed that <span class="quote">"every Auschwitz survivor seems to
have gone through a selection by Mengele, as if he manned his post 24
hours a day."</span>[34] In fact, Mengele took his turn at <span
class="quote">"ramp duty"</span> like the rest of the medical staff in
the camp. There is no evidence that he served there more frequently or
for longer hours than his colleagues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon, though, readers would see Segal himself defending his claims
eloquently in an interview published 18 February 1987 in West Berlin in
the daily newspaper <em>tageszeitung</em> (<em>taz</em>).[86]</p>
<p>The interview was performed and published by Stefan Heym (1913-2001),
a widely admired journalist and public intellectual. In 1933, Helmut
Flieg, a German Jew, fled to Czechoslovakia, becoming Stefan Heym. In
1935, he moved on to the United States, where he attended the University
of Chicago and became an American citizen. In 1943 Heym joined a
psychological-warfare unit of the US Army and the next year took part in
the Normandy landings; these experiences formed the background for one
of his best known novels, <em>The Crusaders</em>. Protesting the Korean
War, Heym in 1951 returned all his American military decorations and
left the US for Prague, Czechoslovakia, and in 1952 for East Berlin,
where he became famous as a writer and dissident, his pseudonym by then
a pen name. Although steadfastly a socialist, Heym published articles
and books sharply critical of the politically repressive behaviors of
Soviet-bloc leaders, including leaders in the GDR. Much of his work
could be published only in the West, and Heym was observed and harassed
by the Stasi intensely.[321,322,323,324] Not least because of harassment
itself, Heym's publications found broad interest in both Germanies and
abroad, and attention to the Segal interview was widespread. In
following issues the <em>taz</em> published numerous received comments,
many of which were later compiled by Kuno Kruse in his book <em>AIDS -
Pathogens from a Gene Laboratory?</em>[243]</p>
<p>Heym became the subject of an <em>Operativer Vorgang</em> or
<em>OV</em>, an <span class="quote">"operational procedure,"</span> and
he became a victim of <em>OV Diversant</em>. The aim of <em>OV
Diversant</em> was to monitor and frustrate: <span class="quote">"by
evaluation of the manner of his connections into the NSW [non-socialist
currency area, meaning the West] to examine whether Heym acts on demand
of secret services (or) other hostile organizations of individuals [and]
to restrict his further hostile activities by appropriate politically
operative measures[.]"</span> This was all to be accomplished through
IMs - unofficial informers to the MfS - and by activities of HA XX in
cooperation with HV A, HA II, and friendly security services.[325]
(Figure 15)</p>
<p>According to Boghardt, Heym's <span class="quote">"enlistment in the
AIDS campaign was a major coup for Segal and the HVA."</span>[301] The
term <span class="quote">"enlistment"</span> suggests that Heym became a
knowing participant in disinformation, yet Boghardt and his sources have
not speculated on how the Stasi might have succeeded in recruiting one
of their most resilient victims. Boghardt has also written that <span
class="quote">"like his interviewee [Segal] he [Heym] was probably
unaware of HVA involvement."</span>[301] The implication here is that
the Stasi controlled these two, making them act as they otherwise would
not have acted, that it controlled them so effectively, so cleverly, so
subtly that they <span class="quote">"probably"</span> never caught on.
Heym had been <span class="quote">"enlisted"</span> subliminally. This
implication is not reconcilable with archival findings or live
questioning. Actually, the Stasi initially were aware of neither Heym's
interest nor his Segal interview. Heym's physician, Professor Doctor
Dagobert Müller, had drawn his patient's attention to an item written by
Jakob Segal. [326] Heym immediately grew fascinated by the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth. This was 9 October 1986; in his diary,
unpublished but kindly provided to us by his widow, Inge Heym, he
recorded the date.[327] What was the item his physician had? A copy of
the draft paper received by Bond? A copy of the material Segal had
provided to African journalists? A Harare handout? We know neither what
it was nor how he came to have it. In June 2007, one of us, E.G., gained
access to part of Stefan Heym's estate. There, in a box containing many
AIDS-related books and articles, was nothing likely to have been the
item shown to Heym by his physician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geissler also wrote: <span class="quote">"Mr. [redacted] emphasizes
that Segal and Stefan Heym - writer - are good friends. He reports that
Stefan Heym before he published on the origin of AIDS very frequently
spoke with Segal and that here presumably a connection has to be
registered.[358]"</span> He cited a Stasi file of information provided
by an anonymous informant.</p>
<p>Geissler concluded his section on Heym by writing: <span
class="quote">"Was Stefan Heym a recruit? No. He was a self-deluded
writer following a bad lead. He was impetuous enough to imagine he could
judge intuitively what many others knew they could judge only
scientifically and forensically. He set out to tell a story and ended up
among its characters. Thus did this notable victim of hard-at-work Stasi
manage to become, after <em>die Wende</em>, a notable victim of
<em>out-of-work</em> Stasi."</span> But considering Heym's background as
a psychological warfare officer, I have a hard time believing he was
just a useful idiot, or an innocent victim of Stasi.</p>
<hr />
<p>Geissler didn't mention that when Heym lived in the United States, he
was the editor-in-chief of the German-language newspaper of Communist
Party USA.

<p>The Wikipedia article about Heym says: <span class="quote">"He was a
member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the
command of émigré Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts
designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet,
radio and loudspeaker."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Heym>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Stefan_<wbr>Heym</a>]
The Ritchie Boys were largely made up of Jews.

In addition to producing propaganda, they were also responsible for
interrogating prisoners of war, and they served as prosecutors and
translators in the Nuremberg show trials.</p>
<p>Hans Habe was a Jew who fled from Germany to America in 1940.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Habe>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Hans_<wbr>Habe</a>]
After the occupying forces dismantled the German press, Hans Habe
established numerous newspapers in Germany that were controlled by the
US military government. Heym was an editor of one of the newspapers
called Die Neue Zeitung, whose editor-in-chief was Hans Habe. A
scholarly paper about Die Neue Zeitung said: <span class="quote">"the
paper came to be run by European - mostly Jewish - émigrés who, during
their exile, had received American citizenship and joined the
Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) of the U.S. Army"</span>.

The paper also said that the Nazis had rejected modern art, so an
important part of the de-Nazification agenda implemented by the
newspaper was to get Germans to accept artistic movements like

<p>Before the war, Hans Habe was the editor-in-chief of a Viennese
socialist newspaper called Der Morgen. Wikipedia mentioned that the
newspaper was known for opposing attacks on freemasonry.

The newspaper was founded by a Jew who was a member of the Grand Lodge
of Vienna.
[<a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Schreier>https://<wbr>de.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Maximilian_<wbr>Schreier</a>]
According to a book about freemasonry in Nazi-era Austria, about 70-80%
of the members of the lodge were of Jewish origin.

<p>The book included the script of a radio play about Auschwitz, which
was aired by Radio Luxembourg on April 20th 1945. The script featured
two voices, where the first voice asked: <span class="quote">"And who
decided who should die?"</span> And the second voice answered: <span
class="quote">"Two SS doctors, Dr. Mengele and Dr. Thilo."</span></p>
<p>The script is the earliest source of any kind I have found where
Josef Mengele is portrayed as some form of an evil doctor at Auschwitz,
or as selecting people who would be killed. ChatGPT was not able to find
any earlier source, and Grok listed only three earlier sources, but they
appear to be AI hallucinations.
[<a href=https://x.com/i/grok/share/OaXn2DtdXYuufXXp2slj6ivgk>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>i/<wbr>grok/<wbr>share/<wbr>O<wbr>a<wbr>X<wbr>n<wbr>2<wbr>D<wbr>t<wbr>d<wbr>X<wbr>Y<wbr>u<wbr>u<wbr>f<wbr>X<wbr>X<wbr>p<wbr>2<wbr>s<wbr>l<wbr>j<wbr>6<wbr>i<wbr>v<wbr>g<wbr>k<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>The earliest article I found at Newspapers.com that mentioned Mengele
was published on May 4th 1945, which was two weeks after the broadcast
date of Heym's radio play.
[<a href=https://www.newspapers.com/image/281212980>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>newspapers.<wbr>com/<wbr>image/<wbr>281212980</a>]
According to a report about Mengele by the US DoJ, <span
class="quote">"The earliest document in the Theater Judge Advocate
investigation concerning Auschwitz that mentions Mengele is dated April
30, 1945"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-hrsp/legacy/2011/02/04/10-01-92mengele-rpt.pdf>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>justice.<wbr>gov/<wbr>sites/<wbr>default/<wbr>files/<wbr>criminal-<wbr>hrsp/<wbr>legacy/<wbr>2011/<wbr>02/<wbr>04/<wbr>10-<wbr>01-<wbr>92mengele-<wbr>rpt.<wbr>pdf</a>]
The DoJ report mentioned only one earlier source that described
Mengele's time at Auschwitz, which the authors of the report wrote was
<span class="quote">"what appears to be a radio script or similar text
prepared by the psychological warfare detachment of the U.S. Ninth Army,
dated 28 April 1945"</span>. So the script was dated 8 days after Heym's
radio play.</p>
<p>In Heym's radio play about Auschwitz, an anynymous Auschwitz survivor
said that between 12,000 and 20,000 people were killed at Auschwitz
every day. It would amount to about 4 to 7 million people during a
single year, even though the mainstream death toll of Auschwitz is about
1.1 million people over a period of about 5 years. The Auschwitz
survivor also said that <span class="quote">"by night, the flames from
the crematoria gave the camp a ghostly glow"</span>. Numerous other
Auschwitz survivors also claim they saw flames shooting up from the
chimneys of the crematoria, even though the chimney of a crematorium
does not produce flames.</p>
<p>Heym's book also included the script of a radio play about
Buchenwald, where an anonymous soldier spoke of the horrors at the camp.
He said that the chief torturer at Buchenwald was someone called <span
class="quote">"SS-Doktor Dietrich"</span>, who I didn't find mentioned
in any other source, so he is likely to be a fictional character.</p>

Lehrman presented Duesberg's theory that HIV did not cause AIDS, but in
a seeming contradiction, he also presented Jakob Segal's theory that HIV
was an American bioweapon. He reconciled the two conflicting theories by
asking: <span class="quote">"Might the virus then be a
laboratory-created, minimally infective agent intended to be blamed for
the chemical poisoning it actually accompanies?"</span> Then in the
fashion of Sasha Latypova, he proposed that AIDS was caused by some
unspecified poison or toxic substance.</p>
<p>In the CAIB article, Lehrman also wrote: <span class="quote">"The
Segals' assertions, as well as that of Dr. Seale, Dr. Strecker, this
author, and others, have received considerable attention in the
international press, particularly the Soviet press, which has had many

Segals had yet presented their theory in public in 1985, let alone been
mentioned in the Soviet press.)</p>
<p>The CovertAction Information Bulletin was founded by the former CIA

publication's founding members, only Agee would have been aware of the
foreign government connection. KGB files recovered by Mitrokhin boasted

Another highlight of his biography worth mentioning is that he served 7
months in prison for Medicaid fraud. [ibid.] When the Russian Jewish
mafia was transplanted into the United States in the 1970s, their
favorite pasttimes included Medicaid and Medicare fraud. The police
detective Bobby Sommer said: <span class="quote">"The Russian gangsters
have told me that they've come here to suck our country dry. My uncle
died on the beaches of Normandy defending this country. How did the
Russian mob become so entrenched? They are into Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid fraud. Why is it that every ambulance service in
Brooklyn is run by the Russian mob? Why are so many of their doctors
practicing without a license? They have invaded Wall Street from
boiler-room operations to brokerage houses. Nothing is too small for
them to steal. Even the guys with the multimillion-dollar Medicare scam
still have to have their food stamps."</span>

<p>Konstantin Kapitonov was a Russian intelligence operative whose cover
was working as a journalist. He used to work as the Egyptian

mentioned that Literaturnaya Gazeta also published a story about the CIA

which was actually the KGB's <span class="quote">"prime conduit in the

former KGB General Oleg Kalugin. The year Kapitonov left Moscow for
Beirut, <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> published a long story titled,
<span class="quote">"Incubator of Death,"</span> about a CIA factory for
weaponized mosquitoes. The story was a response to the American
accusations that the Soviet army had used chemical weapons in
Afghanistan, and was designed to deflect blame.</p>
<p>The network of <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>'s foreign bureaus around
the world was essentially a joint enterprise sponsored by the KGB. The
weekly got bureaus, and KGB spies were given journalistic cover.</p>

<p>But anyway, in the book <span class="quote">"Active Measures: The
Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare"</span>, Thomas
Rid wrote that the story about the weaponized mosquitoes was supposedly
based on leaked documents that were provided to a Russian journalist by
an editor of CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast dark cloud of billions of buzzing mosquitoes swarms toward a
distant city skyline. The lead mosquito's legs are armored with spikes,
its eyes and mouth so magnified they appear gigantic. At second glance,
the creature's mouth is not that of a normal mosquito, but an
engineered, razor-sharp syringe. The swarm is emanating from the dark
eye sockets of a human skull, a skull smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>This bizarre illustration appeared in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
on February 3, 1982, above a long story titled <span
class="quote">"Incubator of Death."</span> The piece, written in the
first person, was a kind of travelogue into a CIA factory for weaponised
mosquitoes. The author, Iona Andronov, started his adventure after
visiting the editor of <span class="quote">"the journal <span
class="quote">'Covert Action'</span> in Washington,"</span> (a reference
to <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>). That Washington editor
showed Andronov, he claimed, <span class="quote">"leaked documents from
the CIA"</span> that led his investigation to Lahore, Pakistan. En route
from Moscow to Lahore, Andronov recounted, his luggage was taken away
during a layover, then he was followed by Pakistani security, and
diplomatic phone numbers appeared to mysteriously stop working. American
spies were on his heels. Nevertheless, the intrepid reporter managed to
charm his way into the secret mosquito lab.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The killer mosquito story was part of a larger, more complex campaign
to deflect blame, and to compromise the U.S. and NATO over biological
and chemical weapons. The campaign was code-named TARAKANY, <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> in Russian. Even if the Soviet claim
that the CIA was developing chemical weapons in Lahore was revealed as
fake, that revelation would make it easier for the USSR to claim that
the CIA's reports of Soviet chemical weapons in Afghanistan were equally
made-up. Just when the United States was getting ready to publish a
major report on Soviet chemical weapons, <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
alleged that the Pakistan Malaria Research Center was a CIA-funded
laboratory to breed weaponized mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The story was clumsy but creative. Iona Andronov depicted the
Americans he met in the <span class="quote">"mosquito factory"</span> as
cartoonish villains - fat, fiendish, crude, and cunning. The University
of Maryland lab in Lahore and its fight against malaria, he claimed, was
only a façade; behind it were <span class="quote">"poisoners from
overseas"</span> who plotted to infect entire cattle herds with viruses
and then take advantage of the seasonal migration of the herds from
Pakistan to Afghanistan to start an epidemic of encephalitis in
Afghanistan. The Gazeta story also claimed that a recent outbreak of
dengue fever in Cuba had been caused by imported Lahore-bred mosquitoes.
TARAKANY replayed similar tales about U.S. killer germs in India, Iran,
Bangladesh, Lebanon, and South Africa. The KGB considered its <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> campaign a big success, especially
after Service A concluded that Pakistan had declared the American head
of the University of Maryland lab in Lahore persona non grata as a
result of their work. Andropov, the chairman of the KGB, even awarded a
testimonial to his resident in Pakistan.[3]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Just a few months later, <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>
published a special issue on chemical weapons. The Bulletin also claimed
that the same virulent 1981 outbreak of dengue fever in Cuba had been a
CIA operation - it was unclear whether the idea originated at Dupont
Circle or Yasenevo.[4] The Soviets launched an entire range of measures
in the early 1980s that attempted to blame various diseases on the
United States, particularly the Cuban outbreak of dengue fever.[5]</p>

<p>The story about the weaponized mosquitoes sounds like a story
concocted by George Webb. It's only missing encrypted Blackberries and a
nuclear deal.</p>

</h2>
<p>In the book <span class="quote">"Active Measures: The Secret History
of Disinformation and Political Warfare"</span>, Thomas Rid wrote that
when CAIB's founder Philip Agee lived in the UK, he maintained contact
with the KGB through the London correspondent of Literaturnaya
Gazeta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day Agee approached the KGB rezidentura in Mexico City and
offered what one senior Soviet intelligence officer later called <span
class="quote">"reams of information about CIA operations."</span>[26]
The KGB Mexico station chief, however, suspected that Agee was a CIA
plant, what spies then called a <span class="quote">"dangle,"</span> an
undercover agent posing as a defector in order to inject disinformation
into the KGB, and rejected Agee. Agee then went to Cuba's foreign
intelligence agency, the Dirección General de Inteligencia, or DGI,
which welcomed its first high-profile CIA source with open arms and soon
shared Agee's file with the KGB.[27] Oleg Kalugin recalled the
disappointment of failing to recruit the American quasi-defector
himself: <span class="quote">"The Cubans shared Agee's information with
us. But as I sat in my office in Moscow, reading reports about the
growing list of revelations coming from Agee, I cursed our officers for
turning away such a prize."</span>[28]</p>
<p>In December 1971, Agee moved from Mexico to Paris, where he lived
hand-to-mouth at different addresses in the Fifth Arrondissement. It was
then that he began to entertain the idea of writing a tell-all book on
the CIA. From late 1972 to mid-1977, he lived first in London, then in
Truro, Cornwall, and finally in Cambridge, maintaining contact with the
KGB through the <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> correspondent in
London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>British authorities accused Agee of being a Soviet influence agent,
and he was deported from the UK in 1977. After that he founded CAIB. In
the third issue of CAIB, he published a fake appendix to a US
intelligence manual which was written by the KGB according to Rid. CAIB
is supposed to have received the fake appendix from a person who
presented himself as an anonymous US Army whistleblower.</p>

<p>Rid also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1992, the head of Russian foreign intelligence, Yevgeny Primakov,

<blockquote>
<p>The head of the Foreign Intelligence Service issued a series of truly
sensational announcements. He recalled the well-known articles published
several years ago in our national newspapers about the alleged origins
of AIDS in secret Pentagon laboratories. According to Yevgeny Primakov,
the materials revealing the American scientists' <span
class="quote">"forged"</span> plot against humanity were concocted in
the offices of the KGB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The Russian word that Rid translated as <span
class="quote">"cabinets"</span> was <span
class="quote">"кабинетах"</span>, which means offices, and not filing
cabinets like some people might think.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal's booklet was distributed in 1986 in the Eighth
Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Harare, Zimbabwe. Rid wrote that
the conference served as a channel for the distribution of other Soviet
disinformation material, along with a list of CIA officers similar to
the list that was later published by CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KGB was running DENVER as a joint campaign with help from partner
agencies.[31] Ten days after the conference, the deputy head of the X,
Wolfgang Mutz, traveled from Berlin to his partners in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Mutz briefed his counterparts on a long list of ongoing active measures.
One, code-named MIRROR, also boosted in Harare ten days earlier, was a
slim book nominally written by the East Berlin correspondent of
<em>Patriot</em> and <em>Blitz</em>, an investigative Indian weekly. The
book, <em>Devil and His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third
World</em>, was dripping with anti-American clichés and CIA conspiracy
theories. Mutz told the Bulgarians that it contained a list with the
names of 300 CIA officers,[32] again titled, like HVA's earlier volume,
<em>Who's Who in CIA</em>.[33] The Americans, Mutz added, had already
bought 600 copies of <span class="quote">"our book"</span> from the
publisher.[34] HVA had the book translated and published in German. The
Bulgarians agreed to help push the anti-CIA pamphlet into Lebanon and
Syria.</p>
<p>Then Mutz told his counterparts that the AIDS campaign, DENVER,
occupied <span class="quote">"a considerable amount"</span> of the
resources in his department, and added that another HVA department had
done <span class="quote">"a great deal of scientific work."</span> Mutz
was referring to the 52-page Segal study that had surfaced in Harare,
and to HVA's science and technology department, which listed Segal as a
collaborator.[35] The Bulgarians considered it challenging to find a
local scientist to <span class="quote">"support the German professor's
thesis."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 33 says: <span class="quote">"HVA's detailed collaboration
with the named, East Berlin-based author, Kunhanandan Nair, remains
unclear. HVA referred to the book as <span class="quote">'our
book'</span> in 1988. See Christopher Nehring, <em>Die Zusammenarbeit
der DDR-Auslandsaufklärung mit der Aufklärung der Volksrepublik
Bulgarien. Regionalfilialen des KGB?</em>"</span></p>
<p>Footnote 35 referred to pages 55-57 of Selvage and Nehring's paper
<span class="quote">"Die AIDS-Verschwörung"</span>.</p>
<p>The Indian newspaper Blitz published an interview of Jakob Segal by
Kunhanandan Nair in 1987. Nair's article was later republished in two
African newspapers without crediting Nair as the author, and it was
published as a book accompanied by Segal's report.</p>
<p>The original book titled <span class="quote">"Who's Who in the
CIA"</span> was published in 1968 and credited to Julius Mader. Rid
mentioned that the Czech defector Ladislav Bittman said that he was one
of the co-authors of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Julius Mader was notorious, at least in intelligence circles. He had
already published seven books in the 1960s, all of them attacking
Western spy agencies - but he was not working alone. A dozen years
later, Bittman was asked about <em>Who's Who</em> before the House
Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"I am very familiar with the book,"</span>
responded Bittman, <span class="quote">"because I am very sorry to admit
that I am one of the co-authors of the book."</span> Bittman went on to
explain the genesis and purpose of the operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book Who's Who in the CIA [sic] was prepared by the Czechoslovak
intelligence service and the East German intelligence service in the
midsixties. It took a few years to put it together. About half of the
names listed in that book are real CIA operatives. The other half are
people who were just American diplomats or various officials; and it was
prepared with the expectation that naturally many, many Americans
operating abroad, diplomats and so on, would be hurt because their names
were exposed as CIA officials.[35]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some reviewers and even the CIA had criticized the joint KGB-StasiStB
publication for being inaccurate, and hence a botched operation - but
including innocents was not an error; it was part of the action. The
purpose of the operation, as Bittman explained, was to <span
class="quote">"paralyze"</span> not just the CIA but also those innocent
diplomats, journalists, and others falsely implicated in spying.[36]</p>
<p>In Western countries, the book was more likely to be seen as an
obvious fake. In the developing world it would cause more harm, even
deadly harm, as it turned out. The CIA's damage assessment has not been
declassified, but Mader's little red book was damaging enough to cause
the CIA to retaliate in kind. Langley's response was years in the
making.</p>
<p>The Stasi's now-open archives have confirmed Bittman's account: the
Ministry of State Security in East Berlin listed Mader and his secretary
as <span class="quote">"officers in special service."</span>[37] He was
promoted to major in 1964, and received a salary from the Stasi. He had
several code names, including FAINGOLD, HUNTER, and X54.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Rid wrote that part of the objective of HV A/X was to a break up
NATO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 1966, Markus Wolf was called to a meeting in Moscow
on short notice, to meet the first deputy chief of the KGB's First Chief
Directorate. After speaking about the wider context, the officer
deferred to Igor Agayants, the head of Service A.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Comrades,"</span> Agayants intoned, <span
class="quote">"this strategic assessment requires a new quality of
active measures, clear strategies leading into the 70s and effective
measures that go beyond merely destructive methods."</span> Agayants
rearticulated the strategic objective that had been set by the Central
Committee: <span class="quote">"The long-term goal is to remove the USA
from the so-called Atlantic Alliance."</span>[8]</p>
<p>Wolf got the message. On the flight back, he began sketching out
plans to upgrade the HVA's own disinformation unit, and the X was
born.[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coordinators of the Stasi's HIV operation included Wolfgang Mutz
and Hans Pfeiffer. Mutz was the deputy head of HV A/X, and Pfeiffer was
the deputy head of department 1 of HV A/X, which was responsible for
<span class="quote">"active measures intended to provoke or intensify
differences between the USA and its NATO allies"</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rid wrote that when the department X of the Stasi launched an
operation to portray West Germans as neo-Nazis, the Stasi collaborated
with the Bulgarian state security agency COMDOS (which later also took
part in the AIDS disinformation operation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next, Wagenbreth's unit forged a leaflet that purported to come from
the organizers of the neo-Nazi youth congress. The faux leaflet called
for a stronger far-right movement in order to <span class="quote">"free
Europe,"</span> as it approvingly quoted the secretary of the 1936
Olympics Games, and highlighted that the games in 1972 also were not
global but European, <span class="quote">"reflecting the racist
understanding of the superiority of European nations,"</span> as the X
explained in an internal memo.[40] HVA operatives posed as far-right
extremists, even threatening violent action[41] to escalate the
confrontation between West German police and the radical right, to <span
class="quote">"engage their forces in the fight against
extremists."</span>[42] The Stasi distributed the pamphlet to the press
and various national Olympic committees.</p>
<p>A few months before the games began, the Stasi's acting head of
disinformation met with a delegation of the Bulgarian disinformation
unit in East Berlin. The X leadership informed the Bulgarians that they
were preparing a range of additional measures under the ZEUS code name,
including threatening letters sent from supposed right-wing extremists
to the federal and state interior ministries in Bonn and Munich.
Department X also suggested sending another batch of letters to the same
interior ministries, this time purportedly from <span
class="quote">"emigrant organizations"</span> in Germany, in order to
<span class="quote">"create compromising materials on the basis of which
arrests and liquidations of emigrant organizations could be carried
out."</span> Major Hans Knaust of the HVA asked Bulgarian state security
for help in distributing the racist leaflets to newspapers in Turkey,
Italy, Greece, and Arab countries in order to harm West Germany's image
and <span class="quote">"strengthen disagreements between NATO
countries."</span>[43]</p>

<p>Russian-language Wikipedia had interesting details about Valentin
Zapevalov:
[<a href=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич>https://<wbr>ru.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Запевалов%<wbr>2c_<wbr>Валентин_<wbr>Васильевич</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1977-1983, he was a staff correspondent for the USSR State
Television and Radio Broadcasting Company in the FRG. Since the autumn
of 1985, he worked in the international department of the
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>[3], and in 1985-1996, he was the
newspaper's staff correspondent in Bonn (Federal Republic of Germany).
In 1996-1998, he was the head of the international department of LG.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>During his years working in Germany, Zapevalov regularly appeared on
the talk show <span class="quote">"Internazionale Frühschoppen"</span>
on the German television channel ARD, hosted by Werner Höffer, a former
Goebbels propagandist who had undergone social adaptation.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>From January 1999 to February 2001, at the invitation of government
official and former foreign intelligence officer Grigory Rapota,
Zapevalov became head of the public relations bureau of the state-owned
companies Rosvooruzhenie and Rosoboronexport.</p>
<p>[....]</p>
<p>In his memoirs and the accompanying interview, Zapevalov described
his role as a foreign correspondent as something between a diplomat and
an intelligence officer, expressing confidence that <span
class="quote">"it's unlikely that politicians would refuse such a good
channel of communication even now."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that Zapevalov had worked as a foreign correspondant
in West Germany for many years before the Literaturnaya Gazeta published
his article about HIV.</p>
<p>Zapevalov appears to be an ethnic Russian from Estonia with one
quarter Estonian ancestry, and not a Jew. However in an interview in
2018, Zapevalov said that about 90% of the staff of Literaturnaya Gazeta
were Jews:

<h2>
<a href=#LaRouches_Executive_Intelligence_Review_on_AIDS id=LaRouches_Executive_Intelligence_Review_on_AIDS>LaRouche's
Executive Intelligence Review on AIDS</a>
</h2>
<p>On October 18th 1985, Lyndon LaRouche's magazine Executive
Intelligence Review published an interview of John Seale titled <span
class="quote">"AIDS and the security of the Western world"</span>.
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n41-19851018/eirv12n41-19851018_054-dr_john_seale.pdf>https://<wbr>larouchepub.<wbr>com/<wbr>eiw/<wbr>public/<wbr>1985/<wbr>eirv12n41-<wbr>19851018/<wbr>eirv12n41-<wbr>19851018_<wbr>054-<wbr>dr_<wbr>john_<wbr>seale.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<p>At the time AIDS had not yet spread to the Soviet Union, so Seale
speculated that the Soviets might be trying to make AIDS spread faster
in the west by encouraging homosexuality and drug use, or by promoting
disinformation about how AIDS spreads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote as long ago as May 4, 1983, over two years ago, to the bureau
chief of Newsweek in London, and to the bureau chief of Time magazine in
London. In the letter, I wrote: <span class="quote">"If my hypothesis is
correct, and we wait perhaps 20 years before we take drastic preventive
action, half the population of the Western world will be wiped out.
Meanwhile, the communist countries, sheltering behind their closed
frontiers, will watch capitalism collapse in a way never predicted by
Marx."</span></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>And I wrote a letter on Aug. 19 to the editors of the major London
papers and to four or five of the major medical journals. It's headed
<span class="quote">"AIDS and National Security."</span> What I said
was: <span class="quote">"Once the AIDS virus gets into an intravenous
drug abusing community, it spreads even faster than among homosexuals.
Long before even half the NATO forces and their reservists were infected
with the AIDS virus, the West would be a pushover for the Soviets.
Employing the AIDS virus is much less messy and self-destructive than
using nuclear weapons or nerve gas. Its spread is easily prevented in a
totalitarian state, unlike incoming missiles containing nuclear or
chemical warheads. The Soviets did not deliberately start the AIDS
epidemic as a form of biological warfare, but only a moron or an idiot
in the Kremlin could fail to see its potential in the East-West power
struggle, now that it is here. Gorbachov could easily contain the AIDS
epidemic behind the Iron Curtain using methods far less draconian than
those employed by Stalin in the '20s and '30s. And if he makes sure that
heroin and cocaine keep flooding into the West, and the porno industry
keeps pumping out propaganda glorifying ever more promiscuous and
bizarre effects, he could be laughing all the way to world domination by
about the year 2000."</span></p>
<p>I did write a letter for publication to the editors of the Times, the
Telegraph, and the Guardian on Sept. 3, the 46th anniversary of the
outbreak of World War II as far as the British were concerned. I asked a
number of questions: Can the totalitarian Soviet system easily prevent
the spread of the AIDS virus? The answer, I am sure, is <span
class="quote">"yes."</span> Another very important question: Can the
speed with which the AIDS virus spreads amongst our people be
accelerated by actively encouraging a permissive attitude toward drug
abuse, homosexual promiscuity, and various bizarre forms of heterosexual
anal sex. And the answer is, obviously, <span
class="quote">"yes."</span> And then, would the provision of
disinformation and misinformation in the West about the many ways in
which the virus is really spread, would that speed up transmission? And
the answer clearly is <span class="quote">"yes."</span> My last two
questions were: Does the Politburo in Moscow believe that the answer to
all these questions is <span class="quote">"yes"</span>? Has World War
III already started?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article Seale did not yet suggest that AIDS virus was created
in a laboratory, and he said AIDS that had been in Africa longer than
the west. He did not yet mention the visna recombination theory, but he
only said: <span class="quote">"This is like what is known with other
so-called slow virus diseases - one or two rare ones are known to occur
in man - but is very like the disease known as visna, which occurs in
sheep. What has now transpired is that the virus which causes this
progressive btain disease in sheep is extremely similar in its
nucleitide sequence, or genetically, to the AIDS virus."</span> (However
the reference genome of HIV-1 has only about 50% nucleotide similarity
to the reference genome of visna if you ignore positions with gaps, or
about 40% if you don't ignore positions with gaps, which is hardly <span
class="quote">"extremely similar"</span>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>In order to find more articles about AIDS in EIR, I tried searching
Google for <code>site:<wbr>larouchepub.<wbr>com/<wbr>eiw/<wbr>public/<wbr>1985 aids</code>.</p>
<p>I found an article from October 1985 by Warren Hamerman titled <span
class="quote">"The Soviets are covering up the deadly AIDS
pandemic"</span>.
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n42-19851025/eirv12n42-19851025_026-the_soviets_are_covering_up_the.pdf>https://<wbr>larouchepub.<wbr>com/<wbr>eiw/<wbr>public/<wbr>1985/<wbr>eirv12n42-<wbr>19851025/<wbr>eirv12n42-<wbr>19851025_<wbr>026-<wbr>the_<wbr>soviets_<wbr>are_<wbr>covering_<wbr>up_<wbr>the.<wbr>pdf</a>]
Hamerman said that he was the <span class="quote">"Director of the EIR's
Biological Holocaust Task Force"</span>, and he wrote <span
class="quote">"For most of this year, high officials of the U. S.
government have systematically rejected Executive Intelligence Review's
attempts to raise the national security implications of the global AIDS
pandemic and declare a full-scale War on AIDS."</span></p>
<p>He wrote <span class="quote">"The entire chain of command within the
WHO responsible for AIDS surveillance programs and information is under
explicit Warsaw Pact Command."</span> He also said that the WHO
controlled the CDC, and he wrote: <span class="quote">"The lethal
pandemic is infecting tens of millions in the West, while the Soviets
chortle that they have no native-born AIDS cases. We now know why EIR's
requests for national security action have been rejected. The Soviets
have been running the global command and control of all AIDS policies
through WHO. How convenient."</span></p>
<p>So apparently other authors at EIR had similar views as John
Seale.</p>
<p>A month later on November 22nd 1985, EIR published an article where
Warren Hamerman claimed that Zapevalov's article in Literaturnaya Gazeta
was published in response to his article in EIR:
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n46-19851122/eirv12n46-19851122_006-journal_admits_aids_could_be_bio.pdf>https://<wbr>larouchepub.<wbr>com/<wbr>eiw/<wbr>public/<wbr>1985/<wbr>eirv12n46-<wbr>19851122/<wbr>eirv12n46-<wbr>19851122_<wbr>006-<wbr>journal_<wbr>admits_<wbr>aids_<wbr>could_<wbr>be_<wbr>bio.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the journal <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> on Oct. 30, for the
first time in history anywhere in the world, the Soviets have admitted
the possibility that the deadly AIDS virus could have been <span
class="quote">"bioengineered"</span> and worked up into a weapon in a
military laboratory. The extaordinary Soviet admission that it was
technically possible to prepare a virus like AIDS as a biological
warfare agent came in the context of an article which featured an attack
on EIR and its founder, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. EIR had published a
cover story titled <span class="quote">"Soviet Role in Covering Up the
Deadly Threat of AIDS"</span> in its Oct. 25, 1985 isssue.</p>
<p>The <em>EIR</em> expose reported that Dr. Sergei K. Litvinov and
other top officials of Warsaw Pact nations run the Communicable Disease
Division of the Geneva-based World, Health Organization (WHO), placing
them in charge of all AIDS work. Five days later, Moscow responded like
a wounded bear. In its defensive rage, the bear revealed more about its
own maraudings than about its victims.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The Literaturnaya Gazeta article builds in intensity to an
extraordinary conclusion in the form of a <span
class="quote">"postscript"</span> attack on Lyndon LaRouche and EIR
directly. The postscript reads in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. While this material was in preparation, the American magazine
<em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> published a <span
class="quote">"sensational"</span> notice to the effect that the Soviet
Union was blocking the fight against AIDS. Note that this publication is
one of the press organs of the extreme right-wing American grouping of
LaRouche, known for his ties to the CIA. It is not excluded that the
publication in the <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> is nothing but
a clumsy attempt to cover up the tracks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Therefore, the EIR Biological Holocaust Task Force has intensified
its investigation into the Soviet role in the spread of the 100% lethal
AIDS pandemic. Currently under preparation is a scientific evaluation of
the basic Soviet biophysics capability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selvage's 2019 paper also mentioned that Zapevalov referred to
Hamerman's article, but for some reason the reference to Hamerman's
article had been overlooked in the earlier papers by Boghardt, Geissler,
and Selvage.</p>
<p>The Soviets had clearly started planning for the HIV operation before
Hamerman's article was published in October 1985, and the KGB even sent
the memo to Bulgarian COMDOS in September 1985.</p>
<p>However it's still possible that EIR was part of the KGB's
disinformation operation but EIR was scripted to play an opposing side
of the debate, or to promote an alternative version of the narrative
that would appeal to an American right-wing audience. So plausibly it
may have been part of the plan that Hamerman would first write an
article that Zapevalov could later respond to.</p>
<hr />
<p>In November 1986 the EIR published an article by Criton Zoakos, who
pointed out that several <span class="quote">"ex-communists"</span>
appeared to be combating Soviet disinformation projects:

<blockquote>
<p>Charles Z. Wick employs in the USIA one Herbert Romerstein, a former
Communist Party youth leader, as an expert for combatting KGB
<em>dezinformatsia</em> projects. His credentials for the job were
supplied by Roy Godson, formerly of the National Strategy Information
Center, and more recently, head of a project to study Soviet
disinformation techniques at Georgetown University's Center for
Strategic and disinformation techniques at Georgetown University's
Center for Strategic and International Studies, the current home of
ex-National Security Advisers Robert McFarlane, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and
Henry Kissinger. Roy Godson, Romerstein's patron, is also a <span
class="quote">"former communist,"</span> strongly influenced, throughout
his life, by Jay Lovestone, one of the founders of the Communist
Party-U.S.A., together with Dr. Armand Hammer's father Julius Hammer.
Herbert Romerstein, as member of a State Department USIA Interagency
Working Group on Soviet Disinformation, traveled to London some time
after Surgeon-General Koop's return from Moscow, and discussed with an
associate of his, Ian Elliott, editor of <em>Soviet Analyst</em>
magazine, a project to discredit Dr. John Seale, a member of the Royal
College of Physicians and outspoken backer of Proposition 64, as a <span
class="quote">"Soviet disinformation channel."</span> On Oct. 31, Ian
Elliott, citing <span class="quote">"ex-communist"</span> Herbert
Romerstein as his authority, alleged that Dr. Seale had charged that
<span class="quote">"U. S. intelligence"</span> had artificially
manufactured the AIDS virus and that that allegation had been picked up
by Soviet publications which, supposedly, were about to have a
propagandistic field day. Though Dr. Seale protested the absurdities of
the Ian Elliott piece, three days later, at a State Department briefing,
Herbert Romerstein's slander reappeared under new wrapping. Department
spokesman Charles Redman presented a document, produced by the
Interagency Working Group on Soviet disinformation, denouncing the
Soviets for alleging that the U.S.A. artificially produced the AIDS
virus for biowarfare purposes. So far, so good. But, inside the
otherwise very true charges against the Soviet disinformation practices,
was embedded the lie that Dr. Seale was part of the Soviet
disinformation campaign.</p>

<a href=#Alan_Cantwell id=Alan_Cantwell>Alan Cantwell</a>
</h2>
<p>I don't know if Alan Cantwell himself believed the theory that HIV
was a recombinant of visna and some other virus. He presented the theory
in his 1988 book <span class="quote">"AIDS and the Doctors of
Death"</span>, but he didn't himself claim that HIV was a recombinant of
visna, but he simply wrote it was what Strecker, Seale, and Segal were
saying.</p>
<p>I don't know if Cantwell later stopped referring to the visna
recombination theory, because he didn't mention it in his later book
<span class="quote">"Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot"</span>,
which was published in 1993. Many of his articles were posted at
rense.com, but when I googled for
<code>site:<wbr>rense.<wbr>com "alan cantwell" visna</code>, I didn't find any
article where he said that HIV was a recombinant of visna.</p>
<p>In an interview in 2007, Cantwell was asked: <span class="quote">"Do
you believe it was the Bovine visna virus and the sheep visna virus,
that was used to create the AIDS virus and how similar do these viruses
look to the AIDS virus under a microscope?"</span>
[<a href=https://rense.com/general75/mmo.htm>https://<wbr>rense.<wbr>com/<wbr>general75/<wbr>mmo.<wbr>htm</a>]
But Cantwell answered: <span class="quote">"I am not a virologist and I
would never speculate exactly how HIV was <span
class="quote">'made.'</span> Suffice to say, I believe HIV came out of
primate (monkey, chimp) animal cancer research whereby primates were
injected (before AIDS) with various cancer-causing and immunosuppressive
viruses - and these viruses were transferred between various animal
species as well and adapted to human tissue. All of this was part of the
<span class="quote">'war on cancer'</span> conducted by the National
Cancer Institute. The NCI also had close ties to the U.S. biological
warfare establishment. The military's biological warfare unit at Ft
Detrick, Maryland, was joined to the National Cancer Institute in the
early 1970s, by order of President Richard Nixon."</span></p>

<p>In the Strecker Memorandum video, Robert Strecker said:
[<a href=https://rapeutation.com/streckermemoscreenplay.pdf>https://<wbr>rapeutation.<wbr>com/<wbr>s<wbr>t<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>c<wbr>k<wbr>e<wbr>r<wbr>m<wbr>e<wbr>m<wbr>o<wbr>s<wbr>c<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>e<wbr>n<wbr>p<wbr>l<wbr>a<wbr>y<wbr>.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you say, well, we look at the AIDS virus, and we say, <span
class="quote">"Well, it's only 50% identical to visna, and it's only 50%
identical to bovine leukemia."</span> And they say, <span
class="quote">"That's distally related."</span> It's like saying I'm
distally related to my mother or my father because I only contain 50% of
their genes. Of course that's nonsense! The fact is that containing 50%
of the genes of the virus, you could be the direct descendant of the
parents. It's the same as each of us. Each of us is a direct descendant
of our parents and we contain 50% of our mother's genes, and 50% of our
father's genes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However that was a poor analogy, because if in the 1980s HIV-1
would've been a recent recombinant of visna and BLV, then early
sequences of HIV-1 would have some segments that would be close to 100%
identical to visna and other segments that would be close to 100%
identical to BLV.</p>
<p>In the next plot I compared the reference genome of HIV-1 against the
reference genomes of visna and BLV. You can see that HIV has about
40-60% similarity to visna and BLV throughout the genome. The similarity
would be even lower if I didn't ignore positions with gaps:</p>

<p>In the Strecker Memorandum video, Strecker also said: <span
class="quote">"And the genes of the AIDS virus don't look like monkeys,
they look like the disease affecting cattle and sheep."</span> But after
his video was released, sequences of SIV were discovered that were
genetically much closer to HIV than BLV and visna are.</p>
<p>In a part of the video where Strecker speculated how HIV would have
ended up in smallpox vaccines, Strecker used the pronoun <span
class="quote">"he"</span> to refer to cows, which serves to demonstrate
his level of knowledge about biology: <span class="quote">"The belly of
a cow would be shaved, it would be sliced open, smallpox vaccine would
be dripped on, he would be placed in stancheons, so that he couldn't
lick his belly. A week or so later they come by, place a stainless steel
container underneath it, shave off the scabs, collect the scabs that are
falling into the stainless steel container, dry it out, and that's your
next smallpox vaccine. Now, obviously, any virus contaminating the cow,
such as bovine visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, bovine sensation
virus, could be a potential contaminant of that smallpox
preparation."</span></p>
<p>Strecker said <span class="quote">"I know that these machines
actually exist"</span> about Royal Raymond Rife's fake microscopes:
<span class="quote">"Now, why was Rife able to do these sort of magical
things that he says he could do? Um, he may have been able to actually
see the viruses. Rife was a master machinist. And he says that he
invented a microscope with which he could actually view viruses in the
living state. He says that the microscope had a magnification of 70,000
- 100,000 times in living tissue. Now, I don't know if Rife actually
invented this machine, and could view viruses in the living tissue, but
I know that these machines actually exist. None of them are presently in
working order, but if they in fact exist, and if in fact what Rife said
is correct that he could view viruses in the living state, of course he
may have been able then to determine what he called <span
class="quote">'the mortal oscillatory rate'</span>, which was the
frequency at which he would irradiate the virus or other bacteria to
kill it. He called it the M.O.R., <span class="quote">'mortal
oscillatory rate.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>During the Q&amp;A section, Strecker said that his group might have
sort of given Seale the information on recombination of HIV: <span
class="quote">"There are many other people saying it. Actually, it's
been discussed worldwide. It's only been recently that this question has
been discussed in this country. Dr. John Seale of the Royal Society of
Medicine, has said that the virus appeared to be manmade, in a sense,
long before we did, but he couldn't exactly construct how that may have
occurred. We sort of gave him maybe the information on how the viruses
could have been recombined to produce a new AIDS-like virus. Uh, Jakob
Segal, an East German biologist who said that the virus was constructed
at Fort Detrick in a biological warfare project."</span></p>
<p>The producer of the Strecker Memorandum video was this guy called Les
Nachman, who was a member of Strecker's group in Hollywood, and who

<p>In the book <span class="quote">"Emerging Viruses"</span>, Len
Horowitz wrote about the following conversation he had with Robert
Strecker (where the ellipses and brackets are part of the original
text):
[<a href=https://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=194&t=2016>https://<wbr>survivorbb.<wbr>rapeutation.<wbr>com/<wbr>viewtopic.<wbr>php?<wbr>f=194&amp;<wbr>t=2016</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEN: OK. Now let's get a little bit more specific about the virus
itself. With regard to the AIDS virus, had it been specifically
manufactured, what might have been the first steps? What do you think
the researchers began with?</p>
<p>ROBERT: I think they began with bovine visna virus, which they knew
was a T-cell destroyer. And they made that by crossing bovine and visna
[viruses] in cattle. ...</p>
<p>Visna is the virus in sheep. Its characteristic is a destroyer, and
they wanted a T-cell destroyer. So they took a T-cell attacker-the
bovine leukemia virus and crossed it with a visna to make a T-cell
destroyer, which is exactly what they got.</p>
<p>But then all they had was a T-cell destroyer in cattle which wasn't
very good for humans. So then they grew it in human tissue, and when you
do that it adapts to human beings (see fig. 7.1). And there are a host
of ways to get these things to grow in tissue even if the receptors
won't take [the virus]. ...</p>
<p>LEN: They could have delivered the viral RNA a number of ways.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yes. One of the ways is by pseudovirus formation. ...
Pseudovirus formation is where you put in a simultaneous mixture of
cells and viruses, and what happens is, for instance, if you put bovine
and visna viruses in with herpes virus; in the packaging process, you'll
get BVV genome inside a herpes coat and visa versa.</p>
<p>So then you separate out all the herpes ones, and it just infects any
cells which are sensitive to herpes. And you can artificially introduce
BVV into a herpes-sensitive cell, because it has BVV on the inside and
herpes on the outside.</p>
<p>LEN: I remember reading through studies about that technique being
used.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah. Another way is you treat 'em with heat, and they open
up. Or you can use some detergents that will open them up, or there's a
host of different things; even some viruses will tend to open them up.
It makes the cells permeable even though they normally wouldn't be, so
you can introduce the one you want to get in even though there's no real
receptor for it.</p>
<p>LEN: OK. So it could've been bovine visna virus, BVV, but also there
was some speculation it could have been scrapie, another sheep virus,
right?</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah, well. ... Scrapie's a little bit different than visna,
but basically I don't think scrapie's a retrovirus. It's like it, but
it's not the culprit.</p>
<p>LEN: During our first conversation, you also mentioned, like other
researchers, you could actually take a look at the AIDS virus, and it
looks like it's been spliced in particular regions.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Oh yes. Actually, looking at it was one of the first things
that told us what it was because BVV and AIDS, of course, look
identical, and there weren't that many <span
class="quote">'D-type'</span> retroviruses. There were only a few.</p>
<p>The <span class="quote">'D-type'</span> are cylindrical-shaped
retroviruses which of course BVV and AIDS are identical. Besides the
fact that they were both magnesium dependent and were T-cell attackers
that would produce syncytium and could wipe out cells.</p>
<p>And then what you do is look at the genome. Actually, a paper by
Gallo published in <span class="quote">'Science'</span> I think about
'83, or '86, said he took the restriction endonucleases [scissor-like
enzymes] and treated the virus, and showed that when the virus falls
apart, that where it falls apart are exactly at the gene lines.</p>
<p>In other words, it manages to fall apart just at the places where
they could have constructed it.</p>
<p>LEN: Is that right? Just where the foreign pieces might have come
together?</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yes, it falls apart in ten or twelve places... because those
endonucleases cut at specific points.</p>
<p>But, what's interesting is ... if it occurred spontaneously [in
nature], why would it fall apart exactly where the genes occurred - the
gag, pol, envelope, the tat genes? [30] Everything sort of cuts apart
just the way you would put it together if you were constructing it. ...
[This] we thought [was] the strongest piece of evidence that would have
said they actually put it together entirely in a lab.</p>
<p>LEN: And how might they have done that then? Let's say they started
with BVV.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Well, in this case if you start with BVV, you just manipulate
it to grow it in human tissue to adapt it to humans.</p>
<p>If you started with BLV and visna, you would ... take the viruses, cut
them up [with enzymes], then chromatograph them so that they're
homologous. That is, the ten different parts [separate], then you take
each different part that you want uniquely and put it together with
other parts and zip' em up.</p>
<p>LEN: And how do they <span class="quote">'zip 'em up'</span> or
combine them?</p>
<p>ROBERT: They have enzymes that sew them back up just like they've got
ones which cut' em apart. These are repair enzymes.</p>
<p>LEN: Then they separate those particular viruses, and they put them
into cells?</p>
<p>ROBERT: They put them into serum ... [add] your enzymes and [other]
parts and wait for awhile. And then throw [everything] ... into a culture
and see what happens."</p>
<p>[I was still a bit fuzzy.]</p>
<p>ROBERT: But you see that's work. You don't have to do that. Nature
does it all for you. All you do is take a cow and simultaneously inject
bovine in one hip and visna in the other, and the cow is your mixer. And
it will do it for you automatically. Because what happens is the viruses
are so unstable that they will recombine and produce every
thermodynamically stable recombinant possible.</p>
<p>LEN: Interesting. It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah. You see that's why everybody says, <span
class="quote">"We didn't make these viruses! We didn't have the
techniques."</span></p>
<p>LEN: That's nonsense.</p>

<p>Which was followed by this figure:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-streckerbs.webp width=420>
</div>
<p>So I guess if you want to create the ultimate killer virus, the only
thing you need to do is inject one virus in one hip of a cow and another
virus in another hip of the cow, and then the cow will automatically mix
together a deadly bioweapon for you.</p>
<p>I don't even know what advantage there is in injecting the viruses
into different hips of the cow, because in order for the viruses to
recombine, they have to infect the same cell.</p>
<p>But anyway, ChatGPT offered the following rebuttal to Strecker's
bovine speculation:</p>

<p>The first point by ChatGPT was partially wrong, because <span
class="quote">"bovine visna virus"</span> was an early name for the
bovine lentivirus that is now called BIV (bovine immunodeficiency
virus).

If positions with gaps are ignored, the reference genome of BIV has
about 50% nucleotide identity to the reference genome of visna:</p>

<p>But still, you cannot just magically create BIV out of visna by
infecting a cow with visna and with another virus that is not even a
lentivirus.</p>
<p>Horowitz also wrote that Strecker said that Segal <span
class="quote">"was writing the same stuff, but again, he thought that
the virus was constructed from HTLV-I and visna. And that's correct
except he didn't go far enough because really HTLV-I is just bovine
leukemia virus in man."</span>
[<a href=https://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=194&t=2016>https://<wbr>survivorbb.<wbr>rapeutation.<wbr>com/<wbr>viewtopic.<wbr>php?<wbr>f=194&amp;<wbr>t=2016</a>]</p>
<p>HTLV-I and BLV are both deltaretroviruses, but their reference
genomes have only about 50% nucleotide identity if positions with gaps
are ignored, so it's not correct to think HTLV-I is the same species of
virus as BLV but only called by a different name because of a different
host species:</p>

54.<wbr>5394</pre>
<p>So since BLV is so distant from HTLV-I, it should be easy to tell
which of them is an ancestor of HIV by checking which of them is closer
to HIV. But in reality neither of them is anywhere near close enough to
HIV to have served as an ancestor of HIV through a recombination event
that took place in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Horowitz wrote that Strecker speculated that Szmuness's hepatitis B
vaccines might have been intentionally contaminated with HIV, because
<span class="quote">"it could be that their actual goal was to
exterminate the United States"</span>. Then Horowitz asked: <span
class="quote">"And who would have been behind that?"</span> But Strecker
said: <span class="quote">"Some foreign party. The Russians or someone
who didn't like us. Because the Russians have talked about that for
fifty years. There have been KGB biological warfare experts that have
been trying to do that to us for fifty years."</span></p>
<p>Later during the same conversation, Strecker said: <span
class="quote">"So both [Seale and Segal] were saying the same sort of
stuff, but neither one could exactly figure out how it was done. And so
that's basically what we figured out, how it occurred. And we believe it
occurred at Fort Detrick. [...] The Russians wrote in over 400 public
places that the virus was constructed over here."</span> It's odd that
Strecker would support Segal's Fort Detrick hypothesis, and that he
would refer to Russian sources as evidence for the hypothesis, but then
he simultaneously speculated that HIV was released by Russians.</p>

<p>When Napoleon invaded Malta in 1798, the Czar Paul I of Russia
offered refuge to the Knights of Malta in St. Petersburg, and relics and
insignia of the Order were transfered to Russia, and the Czar was
elected as the Grand Master of the Order by a faction of the knights.
[<a href=https://www.sosjinternational.org/frequently-asked-questions/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>sosjinternational.<wbr>org/<wbr>frequently-<wbr>asked-<wbr>questions/<wbr></a>]
However a few years later after the Czar died, his son Czar Alexander I
confiscated the properties of the Order, and the Russian branch of the
Knights of Malta remained more or less dormant until it was transplanted
to the United States in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Within a few years from Napoleon's invasion, the Catholic branch was
reestablished in Malta, and it has remained the primary branch of the
Knights of Malta up to the present day. In the 19th century, Protestant
branches of the Knights of Malta were also established in the UK,
Netherlands, and Sweden. The Russian branch is not recognized by the
Catholic branch, but the Russian branch appears to still be an authentic
offshoot of the original Knights of Malta.</p>
<p>Over the years, one of the knights was the UFO disinformationist
Colonel Philip J. Corso, another knight was the CIA's Chief of Research
and Analysis, and another knight was the Imperial Director of the Klan
Bureau of Investigation, which was the KKK's counterintelligence
unit.</p>
<p>In his biography of Francis Parker Yockey, Kevin Coogan wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>In 1789 the Knights' Grand Master surrendered the group's Malta
fortress to Napoleon. A year earlier Catherine the Great's son, Czar
Paul I of Russia, had made it known that he wanted to become the
Knights' Grand Protector. Paul, dubbed the <span class="quote">"mad
Czar"</span> by his critics, thought that sponsorship of the Knights
might help him lead a reconciliation between the Roman and Eastern
Orthodox wings of the Catholic Church. Some Knights went to Russia and
were given lavish financial support from Paul, whom they elected the
Order's new Grand Master on 27 October 1798. After Paul I's death in
1801, his son Czar Alexander I confiscated the Order's properties. As
even Pichel admits, from 1803 to 1890 the Russian Knights <span
class="quote">"remained more or less dormant."</span>[42]</p>
<p>Scattered remnants of the Knights and their descendants in Germany,
Russia, France, and other nations began looking to America as a place of
refuge in the mid-1800s. William Lamb, a Norfolk, Virginia, businessman
and former colonel in the Confederate army, encouraged the Russian
Knights, now an independent chivalric order, to come to America.[43]
From 1890 to 1929 the Knights allegedly held their meetings in the
Waldorf-Astoria. Pichel joined the group sometime in the 1920s. In the
1950s the Knights developed close ties to the Defenders of the American
Constitution, and some DAC leaders became members of the <span
class="quote">"Military Affairs Committee"</span> of Pichel's Knights.
General Pedro Del Valle was a member of both the Supreme Court of the
Knights and its Military Affairs Committee. Other members of the
Military Affairs Committee included Gen. Lemuel C. Sheppard, Lieutenant
General George E. Stratemeyer, Major General Charles A. Willoughby,
Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, Admiral Charles M. Cooke, and seven
retired U.S. Navy rear admirals. The Order's <span
class="quote">"Honorary Grand Admiral"</span> was Admiral Sir Barry
Domville, the Nazi sympathizer and former head of British Naval
Intelligence who had been interned during World War II under Regulation
18B.[44] Both Willoughby and Del Valle had been close allies of General
Douglas MacArthur. In order to overcome the MacArthur network's
opposition to CIA activity in Asia, CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith
once tried to interest Del Valle in heading up a CIA office in Tokyo,
but without success.[45]</p>
<p>Pichel's Knights and Del Valle's DAC had ties to George Deatherage,
an old Defenders <span class="quote">"comrade in arms"</span> whose
involvement in the far right went back to the 1930s.[46] Deatherage was
financed by a wealthy Knight of Malta named Tyler Kent. Kent had been a
file clerk at the American embassy in London; he spent World War II in a
British jail for passing information from U.S. diplomatic cables to a
pro-Axis spy ring. After the war he married Clara Hyatt, heiress to the
Carter's Little Liver Pills fortune. The Kents moved to Florida, where
Tyler lived in luxury while squandering his wife's fortune on far-right
causes. One of his closest friends was Deatherage, who ran a KKK-like
group called the Knights of the White Camellia. Kent gave him an estate
for life in Satsuma, Florida.</p>
<p>Deatherage had some interesting ideas about Russia. He contributed an
article to the 1 May 1960 issue of <em>Common Sense</em> entitled <span
class="quote">"Anti-Semitism in Soviet Russia,"</span> which argued that
the jews no longer held any power there. Yet it was Kent's suspected
ties to Russia that most fascinated U.S. and British intelligence. For
reasons that remain unclear, the British suspected that Kent was a
Soviet spy who had been recruited while working at the American embassy
in Moscow in the mid-1930s. The FBI repeatedly investigated Kent in the
1950s for possible Soviet connections, without success.[47] As late as
1970, the State Department was still concerned about Kent's supposed
Soviet ties.[48]</p>
<p>In 1959, Kent bought a local Florida paper called the Putnam County
Weekly Sun, which he filled with right-wing and anti-Jewish articles.
After the election of John F. Kennedy, he went ballistic and issued
<span class="quote">"special bulletins"</span> like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KENNEDY PROCLAIMED FIRST COMMUNIST PRESIDENT OF AMERICA, (And,
Friend, Don't You Smile.) BEAST KENNEDY IS GUILTY OF SEDITION AND GIVING
AID AND COMFORT TO THE ENEMY WHICH IS COMMUNISM. THE KENNEDY DEMOCRATIC
PARTY IS NOW THE SUBVERSIVE PARTY. A CESSPOOL OF MINORITY-TERMITES WHO
SEEK TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE ANGLO-SAXON WHITE
PROTESTANT!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this time, Kent was a Knight Commander of Justice in Pichel's
Knights.[49] Pichel's Order also included Eugene Tabbutt, who in 1958
was listed as the group's <span class="quote">"Chief Security
Officer."</span> In 1965 he became the Knights' <span
class="quote">"Security General."</span>[50] He also served as the
Imperial Director of the Klan Bureau of Investigation (KBI), the KKK's
<span class="quote">"counterintelligence"</span> unit.[51] The Knights
also had strong ties to elements inside both U.S. military intelligence
and the CIA. The most prominent Knight in this regard was the
Heidelberg-born Major General Charles Willoughby (who legally changed
his name from Adolf Tscheppe-Weidenbach). The former head of General
MacArthur's intelligence staff in World War II, Willoughby joined the
Knights in the early 1960s and in 1963 served as the Order's Security
General. He also ran his own International Committee for the Defense of
Christian Culture.</p>
<p>Another Knight with intelligence ties was Colonel Philip J. Corso, a
20-year Army Intelligence operative who retired in August 1963. He seems
to have spent some of his time in the military working in an Operation
Gladio-type operation in Germany in the 1950s.[52] Shortly after Kennedy
was assassinated, Corso, then in the employ of Senator Strom Thurmond,
began telling his friends in Congress that sources inside the CIA told
him that Lee Harvey Oswald had been an FBI informant. [53]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kevin Coogan also wrote that the leader of the knights was the head
of a propaganda group called the Blue Lamoo, whose members included
Count Tcherep-Spiridovich, who at one point worked for Henry Ford, and
who a journalist in the 1920s identified as one of the two main people
behind Ford's <span class="quote">"Jew mania"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand the presence of the Grand Duke Kirill's network in the
Knights, we must examine the group's leader, Charles T. Pichel. Pichel's
interest in chivalric orders went back at least to 1924, when he helped
establish the American Heraldry Society in New York City. By the early
1930s, he was active in the far right. On 15 July 1933 he wrote to a
prominent Nazi named Ernst Hanfstaengl offering his services as a
liaison between the American right and Hitler. In the late 1930s he
became involved in a nebulous Axis propaganda ring called <span
class="quote">"The Order of the Blue Lamoo."</span> Pichel's ties to the
Blue Lamoo surfaced in a 1939 report by a New York detective named Boris
Casimir Palmer (Pilenas). A former World War I military intelligence
agent, Palmer ran his own detective agency out of an office located at
170 Broadway. On 27 January 1939 he sent a letter to the Non-Sectarian
Anti-Nazi League (NSANL) under the title <span class="quote">"Subject
Japanese espionage."</span> In it, he discussed Pichel's involvement
with Boris Brasol, a leading White Russian anti-Semite, intelligence
operative, criminologist, literary figure, and founder of the Union of
Czarist Army and Navy Officers. Brasol was said to have been a
representative of a Nazi propaganda organization called the Fichte Bund,
and was close to the Cossack General Grigori Semionov, who was financed
by Japan.</p>
<p>Palmer told the NSANL that a Franciscan priest, Father Peter Baptiste
Duffee, claimed that Brasol also belonged to <span class="quote">"a Nazi
propaganda organization known as the Blue Lammoo (sic). At the head of
the group is Charles T. Pichel, an ex-con."</span> Pichel, then living
in Leonia, New Jersey, was said to be working <span class="quote">"for a
member of the IRA who is in the employ of the Japanese Commercial
Attaché in Washington."</span> Duffee identified the IRA man as Vincent
Walsh. Walsh, who later worked with the Japanese consulate in New York,
was tied to Pichel, who was <span class="quote">"said to be an
Englishman, alleged drug smuggler, and Nazi spy."</span> Duffee also
reported on another Blue Lamoo'er close to Pichel, a <span
class="quote">"Count Tcherep-Spiridovich."</span></p>
<p>How well informed was Father Duffee? In his book <em>American
Swastika</em>, Charles Higham reports that the priest served as Father
Coughlin's liaison to Boris Brasol. Duffee was also right about the Blue
Lamoo. According to the anti-fascist Friends of Democracy group, the
Ancient and Noble Order of the Blue Lamoo was a White Russian fascist
organization one of whose members was the <span class="quote">"Count V.
Cherep-Spiridovich."</span> The <span class="quote">"Count"</span> was
born Howard Victor von Boenstrupp. A former patent lawyer, Boenstrupp
was also known as <span class="quote">"the Duke of St. Saba,"</span>
<span class="quote">"Colonel Bennett,"</span> and <span
class="quote">"J. G. Francis."</span> A close associate of Silver Shirt
leader William Dudley Pelley, he was indicted along with Pelley on
sedition charges on 21 July 1942. Nor was this his first encounter with
the law. In 1933, when he was just plain Howard, he was charged with
grand larceny for allegedly stealing a valuable book and other crimes.
During the House Committee on Un-American Activities questioning of
Fritz Kuhn, Cherep-Spiridovich's name came up in connection with two
publications, Intelligence and American Tribunal. He was also linked to
<span class="quote">"the Order of the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem."</span></p>
<p>Boenstrupp said he got his title after being legally adopted by a
real White Russian count, Major General A. Cherep-Spiridovich, who died
a suicide. A friend of Boris Brasol, the count lived in America after
World War I and headed the Anglo-Latino-Slav League. He was also
involved in the Anti-Bolshevik Publishers Association, which published
<em>The Gentiles' Review</em>. Cherep-Spiridovich was the author of a
near-psychotic 1926 tract called <em>The Secret World Government or the
Hidden Hand</em>, and was intimately involved in promoting <em>The
Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</em> in the United States.</p>
<p>Starting in June 1922, the well-known journalist Norman Hapgood ran a
series of exposés in <em>Hearst's International</em> entitled <span
class="quote">"The Inside Story of Henry Ford's Jew Mania."</span> In
it, Cherep-Spiridovich and Brasol were identified as two of the most
influential figures behind Ford. According to Hapgood,
Cherep-Spiridovich at one point lived in Detroit and worked for Ford. He
also identified another Russian friend of Brasol's involved with the
Protocols, a former diplomat and Hereditary Knight Commander in Pichel's
order named Boris Bakhmeteff.</p>
<p>As for Brasol, his ties to Ford evolved out of his earlier connection
to American military intelligence. One of his ex-military intelligence
cronies was C. C. Daniels, the head of the Ford Detective Agency in New
York and the brother of Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.
Dr. Harris Houghton, C. C. Daniels' family physician and the New York
head of Army Intelligence, was also close to Brasol. After World War I,
Houghton created the Beckwith Company to publish tracts like the
<em>Protocols</em>.</p>

<p>The Segals proposed that HIV was in reality a genetically engineered
recombinant of the visna virus of sheep and the HTLV-1 discovered by
Robert Gallo, and that it had been developed as a germ warfare agent at
Fort Detrick in 1977. They proposed that this <span class="quote">"new
germ"</span> was tried out later that year on male prisoners who had
become practicing homosexuals during their incarceration and that, upon
their release, it spread to the gay community in New York.[10] The story
was widely publicized around the world throughout 1987, causing serious
damage to America's reputation, particularly among Third World
nations.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Many might feel that the claims of the Segals, the Streckers, and
their supporters are so patently absurd that they themselves smack of
disinformation campaigns. Others would simply argue that they do not
merit serious attention. Perhaps the best way to respond, however, is to
cite examples of watertight archival samples from before 1977 or 1974,
when HIV was apparently <span class="quote">"created"</span>: for
example, the 1959 sample from Leopoldville or any of the three
Norwegians whose blood from 1971 and 1973 later tested HIV-positive.[16]
Furthermore, we now know that visna, HTLV-1, and BLV are only distantly
related to HIV, far too distantly to have played a role in its origin
(see chapter 11). The credibility of such theories was dealt a further
blow in 1992 when Yevgeni Primakov, the former head of the Soviet
Union's foreign intelligence service, publicly admitted that <span
class="quote">"the KGB planted stories in the late 1980s which alleged
that the HIV virus was the result of a Pentagon experiment."</span>[17]
Sadly, supporters of the Streckers have continued to peddle their
ill-informed and outdated versions of the myth, blaming variously the
Soviets, the CIA, the Germans, and the World Health Organization, well
into the nineties.[18]</p>

<p>The paper served as an English-language overview of Selvage's
German-language paper published in 2014, but Selvage also discussed the
coverage of the AIDS bioweapon theory in American media, which did not
receive too much attention in the earlier papers by Geissler and
Selvage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Selvage wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One advantage that the HVA's former officers have had in influencing
research and public discussion of their former activities, in contrast
to other divisions of the MfS, was their success in late 1989 and early
1990 in destroying most of their operational files - all told, around 90
percent of all the files regarding their activities, including files
potentially related to the AIDS disinformation campaign.[20]</p>

<p>Footnote 20 says <span class="quote">"On the destruction of the HVA's

<hr />
<p>Selvage wrote that 8 days before the article about AIDS was published
in the Indian Patriot magazine, an American gay magazine published an
article about the AIDS bioweapon conspiracy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the <em>Patriot</em> article, the KGB has been credited as
the originator of the HIV-as-U.S.-bioweapon thesis, but in fact the
assertions in Patriot in 1983 and LG in 1985 did not go much beyond
conspiracy theories already circulating within the gay community in the
United States at the time.[29] For example, on 9 July 1983, the Boston
<em>Gay Community News</em> published an article by Charlie Shively, a
radical gay-rights activist and one of the newspaper's founders and
editors, that placed responsibility for the AIDS epidemic squarely on
the U.S. government.[30] In the article, Shively cited a theory from
another leading gay newspaper, the New York <em>Native</em>, that the
AIDS virus had originated in the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). The
<em>Native</em> had also reported allegations that the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) had brought the African virus into the Western
Hemisphere for biological warfare against Cuba. The U.S. government,
Shively wrote, had hoped the ASFV would remain isolated in Cuba, but the
virus had then spread to Haiti and the United States. Because of the
high cost to the U.S. government of combatting the resulting swine fever
epidemic - an $18 million indemnity for the slaughter of pigs in Haiti
alone - Shively posed the question, <span class="quote">"Would it be
possible that - given $100 million - the doctors would just decide to
kill all the queers, Haitians, and IV [intravenous] drug users exposed
to AIDS?"</span>[31]</p>
<p>The <span class="quote">"doctors"</span> in this case were the
medical researchers at the CDC, whom Shively blamed (incorrectly) for
the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study in which the U.S. Public Health
Service had observed the long-term effects of syphilis on infected
African-American sharecroppers for four decades, from 1932 to 1972,
without providing them with effective medical treatment.[32] Shively
also insinuated that AIDS might be an <span class="quote">"ethnic
weapon"</span> developed by the Pentagon. He based this accusation on a
somewhat distorted version of the 1969 testimony of a Defense Department
official, Donald MacArthur, before the U.S. Congress. MacArthur had
asserted that <span class="quote">"within a period of 5 to 10 years, it
would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have
been acquired."</span>[33] Nearly all AIDS conspiracy theorists, both
then and today, as well as the KGB and Stasi in their disinformation,
have cited MacArthur's 1969 testimony as <span
class="quote">"proof"</span> of a U.S. government conspiracy to
construct the AIDS virus.</p>

<hr />
<p>Selvage pointed out that Zapevalov's postscript referred to the EIR
article by Warren Hamerman (which for some reason was not mentioned in
earlier papers about the HIV conspiracy theory):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October 1985, the magazine of the perennial crackpot presidential
candidate Lyndon LaRouche, <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em>,
declared that the Soviet Union was exploiting AIDS as an offensive
bioweapon by somehow contributing to its spread in the West.[44]
Zapevalov referred to the article in <em>Executive Intelligence
Review</em> and accused the LaRouche organization - without any evidence
- of cooperation with the CIA.[45]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 44 is <span class="quote">"See Warren J. Hamerman, <span
class="quote">'AIDS Epidemic Explodes: What Is the Russian
Angle?,'</span> <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> (<em>EIR</em>),

posited by Zapevalov actually existed."</span></p>
<p>Selvage continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In East Berlin, KGB liaison officer Vitalii Lyamin, responsible for
coordinating operations with the Stasi's divisions for foreign
disinformation (HVA/X) and domestic agitation and propaganda, requested
on 12 November 1985 that the latter provide him with all known reactions
in the Western press to Zapevalov's article.[47] The Western press, he
said, might decide to <span class="quote">"hush up"</span>
(<em>totschweigen</em>) the existence of the article and its thesis.
Lyamin was also interested in alternative explanations regarding the
origin of AIDS that <span class="quote">"the Yankees [Amis] might have
spread or may be spreading"</span> in the Western press.[48] The Stasi
complied with Lyamin's request and provided him with relevant (yet
unspecified) materials.[49]</p>
<p>The KGB <span class="quote">"Center"</span> in Moscow was growing
frustrated with the lack of response to its Fort Detrick thesis in the
United States. In a follow-up article on 13 November 1985 titled <span
class="quote">"Why the USA Press Is Silent,"</span> <em>LG</em>
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been well-known for a long time, and it has been confirmed
repeatedly: Every time that an article is published that brings to light
a subversive activity of the CIA or Pentagon, an order for silence goes
out in Washington, and the <span class="quote">"free American
press"</span> follows this order.[50]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two days later the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, Arthur
Hartman, officially protested against the Zapevalov article in a letter
to the editors of <em>LG</em>, but his letter was not published.[51] The
KGB apparently decided that a rebuff to the letter would not suffice to
fuel its disinformation campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next Selvage wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More interesting and useful to the KGB was the response of LaRouche
and his associates to the Zapevalov article. At this time, a cycle of
misinformation and disinformation arose between conspiracy theorists in
the United States and those in the United Kingdom - especially
individuals associated with LaRouche - and various publications promoted
by the KGB or the Soviet government in general. Two major strains of the
HIV-as-bioweapon thesis had, as it were, begun to evolve: a version
promoted by LaRouche and his associates and a version promoted by Moscow
and the KGB.</p>
<p>In November 1985, LaRouche's <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em>
reprinted Zapevalov's article in English translation under the title,
<span class="quote">"Text of Admissions by the Russians."</span>[52]
Warren J. Hamerman, the chair of LaRouche's <span
class="quote">"Biological Holocaust Task Force,"</span> claimed that the
article marked Moscow's response to LaRouche's earlier accusations.[53]
According to Hamerman, Moscow had confirmed with its article <span
class="quote">"the possibility that the AIDS virus could have been <span
class="quote">'bioengineered'</span> and worked up into a weapon in a
military laboratory."</span>[54] However, Hamerman turned Moscow's
accusation on its head. He now wrote of <span
class="quote">"overwhelming circumstantial evidence"</span> of <span
class="quote">"direct Soviet involvement in spreading AIDS in the
West."</span>[55] That is, Moscow had somehow arranged for the
bioengineering or weaponization of the AIDS virus and then spread it
throughout the United States and Western Europe. Hamerman insinuated
that the World Health Organization (WHO), allegedly dominated by the
Soviet Union, had played a key role.[56]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Selvage wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, at the end of October 1988, the KGB's disinformation
specialists in Service <span class="quote">"A"</span> told their
Bulgarian colleagues: <span class="quote">"In the USA there is an
Islamic sect that is blaming Jewish-American doctors of intentionally
infecting Muslims and especially children with AIDS. This can be
exploited with regard to the export of American blood."</span>[89] The
accusation in question came from Steve Cokely, the <span
class="quote">"health minister"</span> of Louis Farrakhan's Nation of
Islam and then adviser to Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer. For many years
thereafter, Farrakhan's organization continued to spread the allegation
that Jewish doctors were intentionally infecting African-American
children.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>An interesting detail in the biography of the Segals is that they
lived in Cuba for a few years after the communist revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s, both had willingly provided information to the Stasi,
although only Jakob was designated a <span class="quote">"contact
person,"</span> and for a short period the KGB took over the contact
with the Segals. From 1959 to 1962, Jakob was returned to the Stasi,
which registered him as an unofficial collaborator. The Stasi broke off
contact in 1962 because Jakob, although still a loyal and convinced
Communist, had proven too independent and had refused to follow the
Stasi's orders. The Segals taught in Cuba after the revolution there
before returning to the German Democratic Republic (GDR).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper,
Geissler mentioned Cuba only briefly, when he wrote <span
class="quote">"Jakob taught in Cuba for three years and in Mexico for
three semesters."</span></p>
<p>Phil Agee also lived in both Cuba and Mexico in the 1970s, and he
announced the founding of CAIB during the World Festival of Youth and
Students in Cuba in 1978.</p>
<hr />
<p>Selvage wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the very latest, HVA/X was activated for the AIDS disinformation
campaign in November 1985, when KGB liaison officer Lyamin secured the
assistance of the Stasi's division for domestic propaganda in gathering
reactions in the Western press to Zapevalov's article and Moscow's Fort
Detrick thesis.[111] Given that the KGB <span
class="quote">"Center"</span> in Moscow had ordered its station in
Karlshorst to have Lyanin track Western reactions to AIDS
disinformation, he likely would have informed not only the Stasi's
domestic propaganda division but also HVA/X, with whom he mainly
coordinated, about his requirements. By the end of the year, the Stasi,
prompted by Lyamin, was also seeking East German scientists who might
come out in support of Moscow's Fort Detrick thesis.[112]</p>
<p>Wolfgang Mutz, the deputy director of HVA/X, later suggested to his
colleagues in Bulgaria's Durzhavna Sigurnost (State Security) organs
that the HVA had taken steps to <span class="quote">"attract"</span> GDR
scientists to the AIDS disinformation campaign and that one of them -
clearly, Jakob Segal - had <span class="quote">"prepared a study that
proves that AIDS was the by-product of a biological weapon of the
USA."</span>[113] Mutz also credited the <span
class="quote">"operational division"</span> of the HVA, with which HVA/X
had been cooperating, for successfully obtaining <span class="quote">"a
great work with scientific value"</span> - that is, Segal's study - for
the AIDS disinformation campaign.[114]</p>
<p>The operational division of the HVA to which Lyamin and the HVA/X
turned when seeking open-source intelligence, such as newspaper accounts
regarding the origins of AIDS or, for that matter, information about
East German scientists working in the fields of AIDS, biotechnology, and
genetic engineering, was the office responsible for foreign intelligence
in the latter three fields - namely, Department (<em>Referat</em>) 5 in
Division XIII of the HVA's Sector for Science and Technology (<em>Sektor
Wissenschaft und Technik</em>, SWT), abbreviated HVA/SWT/XIII/5.[115] At
the beginning of September 1985, its officer Dieter van de Sand
registered a <span class="quote">"security dossier"</span>
(<em>Sicherungsvorgang</em>, SVG), <span class="quote">"Wind,"</span>
apparently regarding the protection of East German scientists in the
areas of AIDS research, genetic engineering, and biotechnology from
outside <span class="quote">"attacks"</span> in the form of espionage or
manipulation by foreign agents.[116] At some point between the
registration of <span class="quote">"Wind"</span> in September 1985 and
May 1986, when van de Sand ordered the monitoring of the Segals' mail,
both Segals were added to the dossier and thus to van de Sand's security
responsibilities.[117] Thus, the <span class="quote">"operational
division"</span> of the HVA, which Mutz later associated with Segal's
study; the office in the HVA that gathered relevant intelligence about
AIDS, genetic engineering, and biotechnology that could be used in the
AIDS disinformation campaign; and the office responsible for <span
class="quote">"securing"</span> the Segals on behalf of the Stasi were
one and the same: HVA/SWT/XIII/5.</p>
<p>Beyond the registration of the Segals under <span
class="quote">"Wind,"</span> another likely indicator of the interest of
HVA/SWT - or, alternatively, the KGB - in the Segals in connection with
the AIDS disinformation campaign is Jakob Segal's early knowledge of
Lehrman's publications in New York. On 19 March 1986 (i.e., before
<em>LG</em> published its May 1986 article referring to the
publications), Segal had written to a colleague about Lehrman's findings
and their publication in an <span class="quote">"obscure club
newspaper"</span> - apparently Segal's (incorrect) understanding of
<em>Amsterdam News</em>. [118] This occurred about one month after
Lehrman had published a press release including copies of the articles
from <em>Amsterdam News</em> and his letters to the editor. He added
typewritten comments regarding the publications and hinted at alleged
attempts at intervention in the same by the CIA.[119] Segal cited the
alleged accusations by Lehrman regarding repression by the CIA in his
March letter.[120] How did Segal, living in Communist East Berlin, learn
so quickly about Lehrman's articles in the <span
class="quote">"obscure"</span> <em>Amsterdam News</em> in New York?</p>
<p>At some point HVA/SWT obtained Lehrman's press release, a copy of
which can still be found in the Stasi files, but whether this was before
or after Segal's letter is unclear.[121] Even though one cannot rule out
that HVA/SWT received its information about Lehrman from Jakob or Lilli
Segal, the question of how Jakob Segal heard of Lehrman would need to be
explained. A more likely possibility is that Segal learned about Lehrman
from HVA/SWT. This is far more plausible than the other way around,
given HVA/SWT's access to foreign intelligence, including open-source
intelligence from the HVA's s station in New York. Another plausible
scenario is that Segal and HVA/SWT learned about Lehrman's activities
from a common source - possibly the KGB, which was monitoring the U.S.
press closely for materials related to the HIV-as-US-bioweapon
thesis.</p>
<p>Whatever role the KGB or HVA might or might not have played in the
Segals' research, Jakob Segal began in mid-March 1986 to send his study
to editors and academics abroad for potential publication in scientific
journals and also in newspapers and popular magazines - that is, for
propaganda purposes.[122] With regard to his activities, Segal claimed
privately to have the backing of the international secretary of East
Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), Hermann Axen.[123] Segal
may have been exaggerating or lying when it came to Axen - perhaps he
had simply informed the latter about his own planned research - but Axen
did oversee the party's foreign propaganda, including campaigns in which
the Stasi's active measures played a role.[124] He certainly had the
authority to give Segal the green light for publishing abroad and may
have even commissioned Segal's study for use in foreign propaganda at
Soviet request.[125]</p>
<p>Whether Segal decided on his own to begin his research in the summer
of 1985 (as he claimed) or was prompted by the KGB, the Stasi, or
someone else, HVA/SWT became aware of Segal's research at the very
latest in the spring of 1986.[126] On 7 May 1986, the HVA/SWT's van de
Sand, the Stasi officer associated with <span
class="quote">"securing"</span> the Segals, ordered the surveillance of
their mail.[127] Perhaps the HVA - and Moscow - wanted to know about
Segal's contacts for potential use in their disinformation campaign; at
the very least, HVA/SWT wanted to prevent the Segals from being
approached by Western agents who might seek to contact them.[128]</p>
<p>The month of July 1986 marked a turning point for the HVA with regard
to both the Segals and the KGB's AIDS disinformation campaign. By this
point HVA/SWT had been in touch with Segal to provide him with at least
one piece of advice regarding his study.[129] Whether he took the advice
or ignored it remains unclear, but by this time he would have learned -
if he did not know long before - about HVA's interest in his research.
In the same month, HVA/SWT received its first piece of intelligence
information from a contact person, <span
class="quote">"Diagnosis"</span> - the apparent codename for one or both
of the Segals.[130] The nominal coauthor of the Segals' study, Ronald
Dehmlow (IM <span class="quote">"Nils"</span>), also received his first
secret assignment from HVA/SWT at the beginning of July 1986 regarding
the Segals and their research.[131] At the end of July 1986, Dehmlow's
control officer noted that the Segals were preparing their AIDS study
not only for Axen, as Jakob Segal was claiming privately, but also for
HVA/SWT.[132] Although the Stasi officer had likely learned of Axen's
alleged role from Dehmlow (and thus indirectly from Segal), the
information regarding HVA/SWT's role could have come only from within
the Stasi itself.[133]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 124 says: <span class="quote">"The Segals knew Axen
personally through his daughter, who had taken classes from Segal at
Humboldt University. See Geissler, <span class="quote">'Es gab keine
AIDS-Verschwörung,'</span> pp. 101 - 102."</span></p>

<p>Newly uncovered evidence suggests the KGB, too, played a role in
arranging for the publication and distribution of the Harare brochure -
a fact that conforms to the general claims of both the KGB and the HVA
regarding their cooperation on the AIDS disinformation campaign.165 In a
1992 letter, Lilli Segal named a specific African journalist resident in
West Germany in 1986 as the <span class="quote">"publisher"</span> of
the brochure distributed in Harare in 1986.[166] The journalist in
question worked for an African magazine published in the FRG. The
magazine, at least according to the papers of former KGB archivist
Mitrokhin, was subsidized by the KGB, and its publisher, who also worked
as a correspondent for a Nigerian and a Ugandan newspaper, had allegedly
been recruited as KGB agent <span class="quote">"Borisov."</span>[167]
The journalist whom Lilli Segal named as the <span
class="quote">"publisher"</span> of the Harare brochure had also
authored articles in African newspapers denouncing theories of a
natural, African origin of AIDS as <span class="quote">"racist,"</span>
and he had been cited to this effect in the U.S. and West European
press.[168]</p>

<p>Specifically, the Segals had argued, like the KGB before, that what
became the AIDS virus had resulted from the weaponization of previously
existing viruses at Fort Detrick. Like Seale, they argued that the visna
virus had been genetically manipulated, but not through the removal of a
gene; instead, it had been recombined with HTLV-1.[172] Jakob Segal
claimed that he had discerned the genetic engineering of the visna virus
independently of Seale.[173] However, their choice of HTLV-1 as the
alleged virus recombined with visna turned out to be more malignant. The
leading AIDS researcher in the United States, Robert Gallo, had assumed
incorrectly that HIV belonged to the HTLV family, which he had
discovered. In the United States, Shively quickly grasped what the
Segals merely insinuated. Based on the alleged genetic engineering that
had taken place, Gallo, the discoverer of HTLV-1, was the scientist best
placed to have genetically engineered what became HIV.[174] Only later
did Jakob Segal openly accuse Gallo of having created HIV, but this
demonization of the eminent U.S. scientist as the <span

HIV-as-bioweapon conspiracy theories.[175]</p>

<p>After the head of the AIDS Advisory Group of the GDR Health Ministry,
Niels Sönnichsen, suggested in an interview with the West German press
that the Segals' <span class="quote">"hypothesis"</span> was incorrect,
Jakob Segal, supported behind the scenes by the Stasi, obtained a ban on
his East German detractors offering any further commentaries or
publications in the West regarding the origins of AIDS. Nonetheless,
after 1989, Segal claimed a dissident status for himself in the GDR by
citing the government's refusal to permit the publication of his thesis
inside the GDR. This was at best a half-truth. Publications regarding
the origins of HIV had been banned inside the GDR - a ban apparently
imposed by East German leader Erich Honecker personally. Thus, Segal
actually had a special status. He could at least publish on the origins
of HIV in the West, whereas East German scientists opposed to his thesis
faced a ban on such publications both at home and abroad.[191] Still, a
few East German scientists violated the ban, and one, molecular
biologist Geissler, even denounced the Segals' thesis as an <span
class="quote">"unsavory political thriller"</span> and <span
class="quote">"complete nonsense"</span> in an interview with a
journalist at the congress of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in San Francisco in 1989.[192] Nevertheless, the
ban against the Segals' detractors remained officially in place until
the collapse of the GDR's Communist regime in 1989, and Segal was never
held accountable by the East German government.[193]</p>

<p>In the wake of the article in the <em>Sunday Express</em>, Lilli
Segal wrote to a friend regarding the aftermath: <span
class="quote">"Journalists have been literally pounding on our door for
the last 14 days."</span>[200] Among the journalists who contacted the
Segals and sought to report on or even promote their thesis
internationally were Erich Friedländer, Kunanhandnan Nair, and Heimo
Claassen - all of whom were apparently known quantities to the HVA and
thus, at least potentially, witting multipliers of Soviet-bloc
disinformation.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Comrade"</span> Friedländer had been working
undercover as <span class="quote">"Hugo Lang"</span> for the HVA in
Tanzania.[201] As of October 1986, he was officially serving as a <span
class="quote">"lecturer/trainer"</span> and photographer on behalf of
the East German Journalists' Union (<em>Verein der Journalisten</em>) at
a school for African journalists in Dar-es-Salaam.[202] In the fall of
1986, he reported in a letter to the Segals about his success in
arranging the publication of a letter to the editor defending their
thesis in Tanzania's <em>Sunday News</em>. He also had plans to have his
African students at the journalism school assist in securing the
publication of similar articles throughout Africa. He thought the
newsmagazine <em>African Events</em>, similar to <em>Newsweek</em>,
would be a good possibility. It was financed, he claimed, by <span
class="quote">"pro-Iranian Shiites, and they have something against the
Yankees [Amis]."</span>[203]</p>
<p>Nair had worked as East Berlin correspondent for the Indian
newspapers <em>Blitz</em> and <em>Patriot</em>, both known publication
outlets for KGB disinformation.[204] Before the summit of the NAM in
Harare, HVA/X had arranged for the drafting of a book manuscript
criticizing alleged CIA attacks against the NAM and the developing world
in general. Allegedly, Nair had merely presented himself as the author
of the finished book, published as <em>The Devil and His Dart: How the
CIA Is Plotting against the Third World</em>, which HVA/X sought to
distribute during the summit in Harare. Nair, for his part, met with
Segal and published an interview in <em>Blitz</em> in July 1987 under
the title, <span class="quote">"AIDS - A U.S. Military Monster: Yankee
Business, Not Monkey Business."</span> The interview, the U.S.
government claimed, had already been published, without naming Nair as
its author, in the Nairobi <em>Sunday Times</em> and then reprinted in
the Senegalese <em>Le Devoir</em>. In 1989, an English version of the
Segals' study was published along with Nair's interview in book form in
India.[205]</p>
<p>Claassen was a West German freelance journalist living in Brussels
who contacted Jakob Segal at the end of 1986.[206] In 1963, the HVA had
created a dossier for unofficial collaborator <span
class="quote">"Joachim"</span> and registered Claassen under the file.
Since 1983, Pfeifer, whose department in HVA/X oversaw <span
class="quote">"Denver,"</span> had taken over <span
class="quote">"Joachim's"</span> file.[207] Claassen tried to arrange
for the publication of Segal's study in the West German science journal
<em>Wechselwirkung</em> and in a planned anthology to be titled <em>AIDS
from the Gene Lab?</em> Claassen did not succeed in his efforts, most
likely because other individuals, especially in the West German press,
rushed in and did what he had been planning. In any event, Claassen has
denied any involvement with the HVA or the Stasi in general.[208]</p>

<p>Kunanhandnan Nair's book included a list of 300 people said to be CIA
officers, which was similar to the list of CIA officers that was later
published by Phil Agee in CAIB. The list in Nair's book was titled <span
class="quote">"Who's Who in CIA"</span>, which was also the title of a
book published in 1968. The book was credited to Julius Mader, who was
later revealed to be a Stasi officer. The Czech defector Ladislav
Bittman said that the book was in reality written by Czechoslovakian and
East German intelligence services, and that he was one of the coauthors
of the book.</p>
