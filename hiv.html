<a href=#Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Nick
the Spacecat's Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick the Spacecat claims that HIV is the product of recombination
between SIV and the Visna-maedi virus.</p>
<p>He said <span class="quote">"I've seen there are 12 genes in HIV from
Visna"</span>, even though HIV doesn't even have 12 genes:
[<a href=https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801>https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Nick wasn't able to answer which part of the genome of HIV was taken
from HIV, but he just said that Gallo was <span class="quote">"sizing up
Visna as a dance partner for SIVs"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-4.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Here I again showed him similarity plots which showed why his Visna
recombination theory didn't make sense:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-1.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>A month later Nick again posted the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, so I pointed out to him again that the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium formation:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>He eventually blocked me because of these tweets:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-5.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>In March 2025 Nick hosted a video roundtable, which featured
presentations by himself, Adam Finnegan, Charles Rixey, and Aaron
Baalbergen. During his own presentation, Nick showed the graphic below
where he claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Visna and SIV, and he
said: <span class="quote">"And then they'd get a whole brady bunch of
different chimeras or hybrids. This is my very crude scientific
rendering of that process building HIV - and today's presentation is not
about the details of this - but <span class="quote">'viral
fusion'</span> are the keywords that you want to use if you'd like to
search more about this process."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974>https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-1.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>Then he showed a screenshot of the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, and he said <span class="quote">"Here, in my opinion, is
the final step that created HIV, and that would be fusing this, a sheep
virus with that STLV we mentioned before."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-2.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>At that point I had already told him multiple times that the paper
had nothing to do with the genomic recombination of Visna and HIV, and
the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium
formation and not recombination. So I told him on Kevin McCairn's
Discord that he seems to be deliberately producing disinformation,
because he should've realized himself that the paper had nothing to do
with his Visna recombination theory. And I posted even more evidence on
the Discord that showed why his theory didn't make sense.</p>
<p>However even after that Nick has kept posting screenshots of the
paper on Twitter:

<h2>
<a href=#Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Origin
of Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick's Visna recombination theory had earlier been presented by his
mentor Alan Cantwell. Cantwell in turn appears to have copied the theory
from Robert Strecker, who had presented it by March 1986 or earlier. The
Visna theory had also been presented by John Seale by December 1985 or
earlier, and by Jakob Segal by May 1986 or earlier. However I'm not sure
if Strecker, Segal, or Seale came up with the theory first.</p>
<p>Alan Cantwell copied his theory that cancer was caused by bacteria
from the alternative health practicioner Virginia Livingston-Wheeler. In
his book <em>AIDS and the Doctors of Death</em>, Alan Cantwell wrote:
<span class="quote">"I remember distinctly the early morning phone call
from Dr. Virginia Livingston-Wheeler that started it all in August
1986."</span> And he wrote she invited him to a meeting held by Robert
Strecker, who <span class="quote">"carefully explained the unique
molecular composition of the AIDS virus, emphasizing how it greatly
resembles a virus in sheep called <span class="quote">'visna
virus.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>Cantwell also wrote that Strecker had presented the Visna theory in a
report dated March 1986: <span class="quote">"Strecker began to pass out
copies of a report entitled <span class="quote">'This is a Bio-Attack
Alert.'</span> The manuscript was dated March 28, 1986, and was written
by the Strecker brothers. The report contained detailed information on
their theory, and provided documented evidence to show that the AIDS
epidemic was biological warfare."</span> In the report Strecker wrote:
<span class="quote">"The AIDS virus is Bovine Visna Virus (BVV) in man
with a transacting transcriptional regulator gene inherited from Bovine
Leukemia Virus"</span>.
[<a href=https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/>https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/</a>]</p>
<p>In December 1985 the Los Angeles Times published an interview of John
Seale, which said: <span class="quote">"Seale, who is in private
practice and specializes in urinary and venereal diseases, said the AIDS
virus, which attacks the body's immune system, has one gene extra over
the Visna virus. [...] <span class="quote">'Inserting an extra gene into a
virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engineering,'</span>
Seale said."</span>

<p>In December 1985 the British communist newspaper <em>Morning
Star</em> also reported on statements by Seale. In the paper <span
class="quote">"Disinformation squared: Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick
myth a Stasi success?"</span>, Erhard Geissler and Robert Hunt Sprinkle
wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>On 20 December 1985, nine days after <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
published its Drozdov interview, London's <em>Morning Star</em>, a
communist newspaper, reported that the New Zealand AIDS Foundation had
received a letter with claims similar to Professor Drozdov's. John Seale
had been reconsidering his presumption that the origin of HIV had been
natural. He now said that <span class="quote">"the AIDS virus may have
been manufactured in laboratories as a slow but deadly biological
warfare weapon."</span> He went on to say that <span
class="quote">"there was <span class="quote">'circumstantial
evidence'</span> to back the belief that the AIDS virus was genetically
engineered in a laboratory."</span>[56]</p>
<p>On 26 December 1985, Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">"World
Service,"</span> broadcasting in English, presented Seale's ominous new
inference as a conclusion.[57]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same paper also said that Jakob Segal had presented the Visna
theory by May 1986: <span class="quote">"Five months after his mention
on Moscow Radio, Seale was contacted by an ambitious new ally soon to
eclipse all earlier theorists. In a letter dated 29 May 1986, Jakob
Segal, a Soviet citizen long retired from a professorship of biology in
East Germany, wrote to suggest that <span class="quote">'the AIDS virus
is a chimera.'</span> By this he meant a recombinant of the human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and the Maedi-Visna
virus"</span>.</p>
<p>HTLV-I is not even a lentivirus like HIV and Visna. Robert Strecker
claimed that HIV was a recombinant of bovine leukemia virus and Visna,
even though BLV is not a lentivirus. There is no part of the genome of
HIV that is anywhere near similar to HTLV-I or BLV.</p>
<p>In the 1986 report, Jakob Segal claimed that the <span
class="quote">"The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from
HTLV-I, its larger part with the 3' end from Visna virus"</span>:
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna>https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hybridisation between Visna end LAV/HTL7-III takes an entirely
different course (fig.2c). The ranges of hybridisation are evenly
distributed over the entire lenght [sic] of the genomes, making up
altogether 35 per cent of their lenght [sic].</p>
<p>To investigate in how far coincidental conformities can simulat [sic]
hybridisation, the LAV/HTLV-III strand was implanted in a reversed
direction in a further experiment (fig.2d). In that case there is no
hybridisation at any point, which indicates that the relations
demonstrated in fig.2c are not conditioned by coincidence.</p>
<p>It is therefore clearly shown that in the main part of their genomes
Visna and LAV/HTLV-III are largely in conformity. The differences may
well lie in the magnitude of mutations. On the other hand in this part
of the genome LAV/HTLV-III fundamentally differs from the genome of
HTLV-I. It is therefore completely excluded that the HTLV-I should of
itself have changed, by an unfortunate combination of mutations, into
the AIDS virus LAV/HTLV-III.</p>
<p>One might well be tempted to reverse Gallo's original hypothesis and
to assume, that the Visna virus spontaneously changed into the AIDS
virus. Yet, so far no scientist has gone as far as that conclusion - for
a very good reason. By a coincidence - or a series of coincidences - a
genome part of 275 nucleotides from the Visna virus would have had to
change so greatly, that at least 50 per cent of them fitted to the
corresponding section of the HTLV-I genome, since it is common to the
HTLV-I and the HTLV-III, as shown above. The probability that this might
happen is 1:6 x 10⁸². Such an event is therefore absolutely impossible,
and corresponding results will also be obtained, if, instead of
hybridising the genomes, their nucleotide sequences are compared with
oneanother [sic]. There could not have been a coincidental, spontaneous
transition from Visna to AIDS virus.</p>
<p>The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from HTLV-I, its larger
part with the 3'end fon Visna virus. The whole thing is a <span
class="quote">"chimera"</span>, a system, of two components of different
origin, artificially by nature and only brought by the skills of genetic
engineering.</p>
<p>Recently the nucleotide chain of the Visna virus has been sequenced
(Sonigo et al. (21)). On that basis Stephens et al. (22) drew up a
phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses. According to this, the
LAV/HTLV-III are very closely related. A branch far remote from them
comprises HTLV-I, HTLV-II, BLV (bovine leukemia virus) and other animal
viruses. The marked [two words not visible] between HTLV-I and
LAV/HTLV-III is is also demonstrated by the phylogenetic trees drawn up
independently by Chiu et al. (23), Wayne-Hobson et al. (14), Gonda et
al. (24) and Watanabe et al. (25) (fig.4). A spontaneous transition from
the sub-family HTLV-I to the sub-family HTLV-III/Visna must be
completely excluded biologically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 1986, the <em>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</em>
published a letter which said:
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, The excellent editorial on the AIDS virus infection by John
Seale (August 1985 JRSM, pp 613-15) has stimulated a very productive
discussion. However, I would like to draw your attention to a commentary
on this paper on Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">'World
Service'</span> in English on 26 December 1985, 21.00 GMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifying the origin of a disease makes the search for a remedy
easier. Following this rule, Dr John Seale of Britain has concluded that
the AIDS virus has been artificially created and its appearance is
possibly the result of a human error. This conclusion supports the view
that the AIDS epidemic has been caused by experiments with humans
carried out in the USA as part of the development of new biological
weapons.</p>
<p>Dr Seale claims in his report that, from the viewpoint of genetic
engineering, to develop the AIDS virus artificially is not a problem,
for this it is only necessary to add one gene to the virus causing a
similar disease among sheep. There is ample evidence to believe that
such an operation has been carried out at a secret American
laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The journal also published a response to the letter by John Seale,
who wrote about the articles that were published in October and December
1985 in the Soviet magazine <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>, and then he
wrote: <span class="quote">"These Soviet articles led me to consider
seriously the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have
been man-made."</span> I don't know if he is supposed to have read the
Russian-language articles or translated versions of the articles, or how
he found the articles. Was the Soviet magazine even available in the UK?
Seale didn't include footnotes for the articles in his letter, and he
only provided English translations of the titles of the articles but not
the original Russian titles.</p>
<p>The person who sent the letter to the journal appears to have
misunderstood what Moscow Radio meant by Seale's report. In the paper by
Seale that was published in August 1985 by the <em>Journal of the Royal
Society of Medicine</em>, Seale did not yet write about the Visna
theory, and he didn't even speculate that HIV would be a bioweapon.
[<a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801</a>]</p>
<p>So by Seale's report, Moscow Radio might have rather referred to the
article that was published in the communist newspaper <em>Morning
Star</em> a few days before the radio show, or to Seale's interview with
the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. In the interview with LaRouche's
<em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> in October 1985, Seale did not
yet say that HIV was created artificially.
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n41-19851018/eirv12n41-19851018_054-dr_john_seale.pdf>https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n41-19851018/eirv12n41-19851018_054-dr_john_seale.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>But anyway, I don't know if Seale, Strecker, or Segal presented the
Visna theory first. None of them seemed to credit the others as a source
for the Visna theory.</p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"The Streckers, who
were manifestly eccentric, were never to be mentioned in Segal's
publications, never to be credited as an influence. The Segals did keep
track of Robert Strecker, but they began to only in July 1987, as Lilli
told an East German writer, Stefan Heym, in a telephone conversation
recorded by the Stasi.[89]"</span></p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle wrote that in October 1986 the <em>Sunday
Express</em> magazine published an article where they interviewed Seale,
where they wrote: <span class="quote">"The Sunday Express reported also
that, independent of Segal, two other scientists, Dr. Seale again and,
in California, Dr. Robert Strecker, had come to believe <span
class="quote">'the AIDS virus is man-made'</span> and <span
class="quote">'genetically engineered'</span>."</span></p>
<p>In 2018 Alan Cantwell wrote: <span class="quote">"Robert Strecker was

<p>Erhard Geissler is an East German molecular biologist who wrote a
paper debunking Jakob Segal's HIV theory in 1987. In 2013 Cambridge
University Press published a paper by Geissler and Robert Hunt Sprinkle
titled <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared: Was the

<p>I saved the following excerpts from the paper as notes.</p>
<hr />
<p>The story of how the Strecker brothers became involved in HIV
research sounds phony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1983 two brothers were, supposedly, engaged by the Security
Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, California, to form a health-maintenance
organization, an HMO. The local prevalence and typical actuarial costs
of AIDS cases would logically have altered the prospects of any such
plan. One brother was Robert B. Strecker, presenting himself as an
MD-PhD internist-gastroenterologist-pathologist-pharmacologist; the
other was Theodore A. Strecker, presenting himself as an attorney. A
literature review proceeded. Theodore <span class="quote">"had
difficulty estimating the probable cost of the <span
class="quote">'Human Retroviruses'</span> as related to [insurance]
premium costs and was led deeper and deeper into the literature of
virology attempting to solve the problem."</span> Soon, he <span
class="quote">"stumbled into a written order for the AIDS virus and a
written plan to inject disease during preventive vaccinations for
experimental purposes. ... Apparently, individuals in the United States
National Institute [sic] of Health and National Cancer Institute have
combined with the United Nation's World Health Organization to attack
the United States with BioWeapons."</span> As seen now in its Internet
afterlife, the document in which this charge appeared took for its title
a warning: <span class="quote">"THIS IS A BIO-ATTACK ALERT, MARCH 28,
1986."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In the book <em>Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret
Police</em>, John Koehler wrote that Segal was still a die-hard Marxist
in 1991 and Segal still stuck to his story about HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his third paragraph, Koehler added this: <span class="quote">"I
spotted Segal's name in Stasi documents. ... In a 1991 interview with me
in Berlin, Segal presented himself as a die-hard Marxist, totally
incapable of accepting the demise of communist East Germany. Segal, then
eighty years old, insisted that his information on the origin of the HIV
virus [sic] was solid, and he denied having had any contact with the
Stasi. He was lying."</span>[103]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal's communist Jewish friend advised him so send a copy of his
booklet to a Japanese communist writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal's work was now ostensibly <span class="quote">"in press"</span>
in West Germany - and under a distinguished editor. His other 12 March
1986 transmission was not in German but in English, and it went to
Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Professor [Shingo] Shibata, our common friend Eva Brück
[according to the Center for Jewish History a Holocaust survivor and the
author of <em>Shadows of the Past: Childhood Years in Austria
1933-1938</em>] gave me the advice, to send you a paper my wife an [sic]
I just finished. It deals with the origin of AIDS and concludes, that
this disease did not originate in Central Africa and come to us via the
Green Monkey, but that the AIDS virus is a chimera from HTLV-I and visna
virus, performed by gene surgery in the P-4 laborators [sic] of Fort
Detrick, Maryland, USA, in the fall 1977.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Shingo Shibata was a member of the Japanese Communist Party.
[<a href=https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/芝田進午>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/芝田進午</a>]</p>
<p>Eva Brück's father headed a counceling center for young criminals run
by Workers International Relief. WIR was an organization based in Berlin
that was initially formed to send famine relief funds to the Soviet
Union, but it was later repurposed to provide assistance from the USSR
to communists in Germany, and to produce communist propaganda films and
to import Soviet propaganda films.

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_International_Relief>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_International_Relief</a>]</p>
<p>Eva Brück worked for an English edition of a German trade union
newspaper. She translated texts from Russian to German, and she worked
as a Russian interpreter for people including the Soviet propagandist
Ilya Ehrenburg:
[<a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Brück>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Brück</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1947 she married Josef Brück, who had been rescued from Vienna on
a Kindertransport in 1939. With him, the Lviv Jew, who was considered a
Soviet citizen by the British, she wanted to enter the Soviet Union in
1949, but they were detained in East Berlin and remained there out of
political conviction. In 1958 she became a citizen of the GDR. She
worked for the English edition of the trade union newspaper Lehrer der
Welt[1] and for other newspapers and magazines in the GDR. Thanks to her
knowledge of Russian, she also worked as a simultaneous interpreter, for
example for Ilya Ehrenburg at the World Peace Congress in Vienna in
1952. She translated educational texts from Russian and museum catalogs
as well as a few comics by Hannes Hegen into English. For her trips
abroad to Scandinavia, Mongolia, North America, Asia, Africa, and even
Austria, she fought with the SED party bureaucracy over travel
permits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jews from East Germany who were involved in promoting AIDS
disinformation include Jakob Segal, Lilli Segal, Eva Brück, Samuel Mitja
Rapoport, Stefan Heym, and Markus Wolf. But according to ChatGPT, there
were only about 500-1500 Jews in East Germany:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are the main scholarly and archival sources supporting those
figures on the Jewish population in the <strong>German Democratic
Republic (DDR)</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in
Deutschland)</strong> - archival demographic summaries (post-1990
reports referencing pre-reunification membership data).</li>
<li><strong>Robin Ostow (ed.)</strong>, <em>Jews in Contemporary East
Germany: The Jewish Communities of East Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and
Erfurt</em> (Cambridge University Press, 1989).
<ul>
<li>Gives detailed community membership numbers and notes that "fewer
than 700 registered Jews" remained in the GDR by the 1980s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Michael Brenner</strong>, <em>After the Holocaust:
Rebuilding Jewish Lives in Postwar Germany</em> (Princeton University
Press, 1997).
<ul>
<li>States that about 1,500 Jews lived in the Soviet zone in 1949,
declining to around 400 by 1990.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Monika Richarz</strong>, <em>Juden in Deutschland nach 1945:

<ul>
<li>Provides corroborating demographic trends and discusses migration
from East to West Germany in the early 1950s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Statistisches Jahrbuch der DDR</strong> (Statistical
Yearbook of the GDR) - although it did <strong>not record religious or
ethnic data</strong>, these figures can be inferred from contemporary
Jewish community membership reports and emigration statistics.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, across the academic literature the range <strong>400-700
Jews (≈0.005% of the DDR population)</strong> during most of the state's
existence is consistently cited.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal worked with the Stasi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Segals many years earlier had moved to East Berlin after the
Soviet consulate in Paris had <span class="quote">"proposed"</span> they
do so.[149] Jakob had then become an active unofficial Stasi
informer.[150] [...] Segal had been assigned to a Fübrungsoffizier - <span
class="quote">"an intelligence officer directly responsible for an
individual agent"</span>[153] named Captain Kairies. But in 1955 Segal
had been shuffled over to new direction. Captain Kairies had filed this
note: <span class="quote">"Today instructed by comrade advisor not to
have additional meetings with Segal. All actions that can be performed
by S. are to be arranged by instructor."</span>[154] The terms <span
class="quote">"comrade advisor"</span> and <span
class="quote">"instructor"</span> usually referred to officers of the
KGB responsible for maintenance of cooperation with the MfS. By 1962 the
MfS had decided to end its cooperation with Segal. Its reasons were
substantive: <span class="quote">"[H]e adopts a platform contrary to the
DAW [Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, German Academy of
Sciences at Berlin]. ... Information provided by him is very general ...
[and] the IM [the informer, Segal] is shunned by many
scientists."</span>[155]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Werner Grossman was the head of the Stasi's reconnaissance department
HVA. His publisher sent an email to Geissler which said that <span
class="quote">"the KGB initiated the affair involving Segal"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2011, Colonel General Werner Grossmann - from 1986 Deputy Minister
of State Security and successor to Markus Wolf as head of HVA[157] -
said in response to our inquiry, but through his publisher, <span
class="quote">"that the KGB initiated the affair involving Segal
[<em>die Sache mit Segal initiiert habe</em>]."</span>[158]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"No document
available to us proves or refutes the claim that the KGB invented the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth or that the KGB in <span
class="quote">'initiating the affair'</span> told Segal what ideas to
have rather than urging him to promote the ideas he already did have or
already had borrowed, whether or not he credited all his own
sources."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Soviet sources promoted the Segals, Strecker, and Seale, who all
claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Visna and some other virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For public consumption, as noted by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>,
Soviet stories consistently cited four conveniently vocal conspiracy
theorists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert Strecker, invariably described only as an <span
class="quote">"American scientist;"</span> John Seale, <span
class="quote">"a prominent specialist working in London,"</span> and the
East German husband-wife team of Jacob [sic] and Lilli Segal, whom the
Soviet press often identifies as French.[33]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Fort Detrick story was promoted by Rolf Wagenbrecht, who was the
head of the disinformation department of Stasi. Günter Bohnsack was the
head of the <span class="quote">"trade and industry"</span> section of
the disinformation department, but the three people he named as being
responsible for promoting disinformation about HIV were Jakob Segal,
Stefan Heym, and Johannes Mario Simmel, who were all Jews (German
original text omitted here):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long thereafter, on 27 January 1992, AIDS disinformation entered
its exponential phase, its disinformation-squared phase.
<em>Panorama</em>, a German television news magazine, was reporting that
the story of HIV having spread from Fort Detrick <span
class="quote">"after a geneaccident ... had been elaborated by the Russian
KGB and the Stasi, as [Colonel Dr. Rolf] Wagenbreth and his team boast
today. They also took responsibility for its world-wide
dissemination."</span>[177] When Segal had most actively been
propagating the myth, Wagenbreth had been head of Department X - the
<span class="quote">"X"</span> meaning <span class="quote">"10"</span>
of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance, HV A; thus, Wagenbreth had
been head of HV A/X. His responsibility, about which he refused to
comment during the broadcast, had been disinformation.</p>
<p>Stasi veterans, their civil liberties assured, were stepping up to
brag: to take credit, not to take blame. More soon followed, Günter
Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer most notably. Bohnsack said he had been
head of HV A/X Section 7, <span class="quote">"Trade and
Industry,"</span>[178] but was later described as having beer
responsible for disinformation within HV A/X.[179] Brehmer said he had
been responsible for Westert agencies within HV A/X Section 5, <span
class="quote">"Secret Services."</span>[178]</p>
<p>That same year, 1992, Bohnsack and Brehme published a book,
<em>Auftrag Irreführung. Wie die Stas Politik im Westen machte</em>
[<em>Mission Misleading: How the Stasi Made Politics in the West</em>].
<span class="quote">"The superpower [the Soviet Union] dealt the
cards,"</span> they wrote, <span class="quote">"and also took care not
to reveal its own hand. It respected the junior partner [the GDR], but
saw the appropriate balance of power at the negotiation table through
Moscow's eyes - and so the GDR shrunk back to being a small country in
central Europe."</span> Then came five paragraphs about the myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Moscow communicated clearly when it came to the planned AIDS
campaign against the USA. The quick spread of this terrible disease to
millions of people, especially in Africa, renewed the discussion about
the origin of the virus. During this time, a number of theses and
theories were proposed; a prominent one among them was that new genetic
research undertaken in the US could have produced a deformed organism
that threatened humanity. With this background, the concept for the
campaign practically wrote itself. The campaign allowed us to tie in our
other active measures, such as our argument, launched to reach across
the world, that the United States already had experience with germ
warfare in Korea.</p>
<p>The substance of our disinformation action consisted of the following
propositions: The AIDS virus was created in a special secure virus and
gene laboratory of the military research institute in Fort Detrick
(Maryland/USA). By 1977 it had passed via experimental subjects
uncontrolled into the public sphere and had initiated the deadly
catastrophe. The USA as repository of all threats - the classic closeup
used by the East. And the HVA went all out to publicize the idea.</p>
<p>First, the East Berlin professor Jakob Segal took up this version.
Stefan Heym made sure, through an interview he conducted for the West
Berlin [daily newspaper] <em>tageszeitung (taz)</em> with the scientist,
to spread the AIDS lie in Europe, [and] journalists carried the story to
Africa and to other regions afflicted by the disease.</p>
<p>Finally, the best-selling author Johannes Mario Simmel, who was then
writing about the topic of genetic research, availed himself innocently
of the materials sent to him and adopted the details of our
construction. The corresponding passages appear in the 1987 novel
<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>, published by Droemer
Knaur in Munich. A masterpiece of active measures, as one in the GDR
leadership circle found it to be.</p>
<p>Who contributed knowingly to disseminating this dirty story and who
deceived themselves and let themselves be used is an open question. The
subsequent General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev,
did, by the way, apologize to the United States for this
action.[105]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boghardt's assessments of Bohnsack and Brehmer and also of Klaus
Behling, a former GDR diplomat, were not limited to written records but
were enhanced by more interactive personal contacts. These assessments
occurred long after Jakob and Lilli Segal had died. According to
Boghardt and his sources, the GDR Ministry of State Security became
involved in the myth through its branch responsible for disinformation
and other <span class="quote">"active measures,"</span> Department X
[10] of the <em>Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung</em> HV A [Main Directorate
for Reconnaissance]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having decided to revive the AIDS campaign, the KGB informed its East
German counterpart unambiguously that Moscow expected it to participate.
The East Germans were told specifically to employ a"scientific approach"
and produce disinformation contending the AIDS virus had been developed
at Fort Detrick from where it spread to the general population through
human testing. Beyond those obligatory details the East Germans were
given a free hand in devising their own strategy and spreading the
story.[181]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"As Moscow shifted its active measures focus to
subjects other than AIDS,"</span> Boghardt has related,"the East Germans
became the AIDS campaign's primary sponsor."[182] The East German agent
of choice"[181] to spread the fiction on behalf of the KGB and MfS was,
according to Boghardt and his sources, Professor Jakob Segal.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The communist Jew Samuel Mitja Rapoport proposed to publish a daily
newspaper about the AIDS conspiracy theory in November 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 29 November, Dr. Helmut Theodor, a high-ranking staffer at the GDR
Ministry of Health, noted that Samuel Mitja Rapoport, Professor of
Biochemistry at Humboldt University and a leading communist health
politician as well as Segal's colleague and close friend, had proposed
<span class="quote">"to publish in the daily news a paper on AIDS.
Objective: The AIDS agent has been manipulated and has escaped from an
American laboratory (biological weapons)."</span>[197] Referring to
reports about the presence of antibodies against the AIDS agent in sera
taken in Africa between 1960 and 1965 - and presumably also because his
superior, Health Minister Professor Ludwig Mecklinger, had decided
already by early 1984 not to deal with the AIDS problem in public[298] -
Theodor rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>This story is a little strange, since Rapoport never dealt with the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth in any of his numerous publications. He might
have realized soon that the myth was totally unfounded.[198] Or Theodor
might not have been informed correctly. Perhaps the proposal came not
from Rapoport but from Segal. Documents available to us are silent on
this question.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1985, three days after Theodor's rejection of the
putative Rapoport proposal, Segal wrote to Müller-Hill, mentioning a
suspicion raised primarily <span class="quote">"in the Indian newspaper
Citizen [sic] and"</span> secondarily in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
that the AIDS agent had been assembled, through genetic engineering, to
be a biological weapon.[104] Neither of the Segals was to mention either
article in any published work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 197 referred to a file in the German federal archives
(<em>Bundesarchiv</em>): <span class="quote">"Helmut Theodor, note. 29
November 1985. BArch DQ1 13080. Translated by E.G."</span>.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Samuel Mitja Rapoport says: <span
class="quote">"Of Jewish descent and a committed communist, he fled
Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany, and moved to the United
States. In 1950, as a result of an investigation of un-American
activities, he was offered a professorship in East Berlin."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Mitja_Rapoport>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Mitja_Rapoport</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Lilli Segal claimed that her source for the Fort Detrick theory was
Urania Press. It was published by the URANIA Society, whose biology
section was headed by Erhard Geissler beween 1971 and 1990:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, according to Christopher Dobson of <em>The Sunday
Telegraph</em>, Lilli Segal told officials of the US Embassy in East
Berlin <span class="quote">"that her source for the accusations that the
virus was made at Fort Detrick was the East German Urania Press.
Urania's prime function is disseminating Soviet propaganda."</span>[234]
Whether Dobson's description of the prime function of the URANIA was
Lilli's wording or his own is unclear. In any event, the description was
wrong. URANIA's Biology Section, which would have been the Segals'
contact point, was no mouthpiece, not the KGB's, not the Stasi's.</p>
<p>The URANIA Society - <em>Gesellschaft zur Verbreitung
wissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse</em> [Society for the Dissemination of
Scientific Knowledge] - was a <span class="quote">"mass
organization"</span> of the GDR acting under the supervision and
direction of the Socialist Unity Party, the SED. It was funded almost
solely by the government, its main function being to spread Marxist
ideology. Nonetheless, in its natural-sciences sections, members -
mainly scientists and teachers - informed the public on progress in
their respective fields. The Biology Section, headed by E.G. between
1971 and 1990, was heavily involved, for example, in <span
class="quote">"disseminating scientific knowledge"</span> about modern
genetics, cancer research, neurobiology, and so on. Even topics breaking
a GDR taboo, such as the taboo against research into human behavior,
URANIA could and did explore.</p>
<p>Some members of the Biology Section had also been involved in
activities to prevent the military misuse of new developments in
molecular biology. E.G., contributor to the 1984 yearbook of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)[213] and
consultant to SIPRI from 1985 to 2000 for biological warfare
matters,[214] expressed his concern about the potential of genetic
engineering to develop biological and toxic warfare agents. The SIPRI
Yearbook contribution was translated and reprinted in a booklet
published by the Presidium of URANIA.[215] In another SIPRI book, E.G.
quoted,[216] inter alia, the US Department of Defense, which in Soviet
Military Power 1984 had explained <span class="quote">"that for
biological warfare purposes, genetic engineering could open a large
number of possibilities. Normally harmless, nondisease-producing
organisms could be modified to become highly toxic or produce diseases
for which an opponent has no known treatment or cure. Other agents, now
considered too unstable for storage or biological warfare applications,
could be changed sufficiently to be an effective agent."</span>[217]
This assessment was also quoted in a popular-science journal edited by
the GDR Academy of Sciences.[218] Segal himself quoted a French
translation of a passage from this assessment in 1986 in <span
class="quote">"Le SIDA - sa nature et son origine"</span>[241] and
quoted a shorter version in a chapter he wrote for another book.[219]
After a 1986 experts' meeting in which E.G. rejected allegations about
Fort Detrick being responsible for AIDS, Segal stopped using this
passage altogether.[220]</p>
<p>The Segals might well have been influenced by URANIA insofar as
genetic engineering was described as making bioweaponry research more
dangerous, and they might have wondered whether American concerns about
Soviet efforts were designed to screen America's own efforts. But the
myth itself was not to be found there. To the contrary, in 1988, under
URANIA's aegis, E.G. published an article criticizing the myth
expressly.[221]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The founder and president of URANIA Society fled Germany to Spain in
1933 because he was a member of the German Communist Party, but he was
later forcibly repatriated to Germany.

<p>An article published in <em>Los Angles Times</em> in 1987 said: <span
class="quote">"Upon learning of the Segal report, U.S. embassy officers
in Berlin met on Oct. 10 with Dr. Lilli Segal to point out the
fallacies. She repeated her allegations, citing as a source Urania
Press, a publishing house run by the government of East Germany that
disseminates propaganda to the general public."</span>
[<a href=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-04-19-op-1947-story.html>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-04-19-op-1947-story.html</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal were members of a division of Stasi that was
responsible for gathering scientific and technical information published
in western countries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob Segal was just an <span class="quote">"IM,"</span> an
<em>inoffizieller Mitarbeiter</em> or <span class="quote">"unofficial
collaborator,"</span> an informer for the Ministry for State Security -
one of approximately 180,000 IMs reporting to the MfS.[230,231] Whether
he was actively informing in the mid-1980s we do not know. Lilli,
however, did report to the MfS at least twice on the interest of the US
Embassy in East Berlin in Jakob's activities.[81,116] No document
reveals whether she was asked to provide such reports or provided them
conscientiously - or prudentially.</p>
<p>In one document dealing with the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth, Colonel
Oldenburg, deputy head of Department IX/C of the HV A, mentioned that
Segal and his wife <span class="quote">"are registered by HV
A/SWT/XIII."</span>[232] This registration was of long-standing and
could not have related to AIDS. Moreover, responsibilities of the
departments chancing upon the Segals' AIDS activities did not include
<span class="quote">"active measures."</span> Department IX of the HV A
performed external counter-intelligence, especially in West Germany.
Department HV A/SWT was responsible for the gathering of scientific and

<hr />
<p>An interview of Segal was published in a West German newspaper by
Stefan Heym, who was a Jew who worked for a psychological warfare unit
of the US Army:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soon, though, readers would see Segal himself defending his claims
eloquently in an interview published 18 February 1987 in West Berlin in
the daily newspaper <em>tageszeitung</em> (<em>taz</em>).[86]</p>
<p>The interview was performed and published by Stefan Heym (1913-2001),
a widely admired journalist and public intellectual. In 1933, Helmut
Flieg, a German Jew, fled to Czechoslovakia, becoming Stefan Heym. In
1935, he moved on to the United States, where he attended the University
of Chicago and became an American citizen. In 1943 Heym joined a
psychological-warfare unit of the US Army and the next year took part in
the Normandy landings; these experiences formed the background for one
of his best known novels, <em>The Crusaders</em>. Protesting the Korean
War, Heym in 1951 returned all his American military decorations and
left the US for Prague, Czechoslovakia, and in 1952 for East Berlin,
where he became famous as a writer and dissident, his pseudonym by then
a pen name. Although steadfastly a socialist, Heym published articles
and books sharply critical of the politically repressive behaviors of
Soviet-bloc leaders, including leaders in the GDR. Much of his work
could be published only in the West, and Heym was observed and harassed
by the Stasi intensely.[321,322,323,324] Not least because of harassment
itself, Heym's publications found broad interest in both Germanies and
abroad, and attention to the Segal interview was widespread. In
following issues the <em>taz</em> published numerous received comments,
many of which were later compiled by Kuno Kruse in his book <em>AIDS -
Pathogens from a Gene Laboratory?</em>[243]</p>
<p>Heym became the subject of an <em>Operativer Vorgang</em> or
<em>OV</em>, an <span class="quote">"operational procedure,"</span> and
he became a victim of <em>OV Diversant</em>. The aim of <em>OV
Diversant</em> was to monitor and frustrate: <span class="quote">"by
evaluation of the manner of his connections into the NSW [non-socialist
currency area, meaning the West] to examine whether Heym acts on demand
of secret services (or) other hostile organizations of individuals [and]
to restrict his further hostile activities by appropriate politically
operative measures[.]"</span> This was all to be accomplished through
IMs - unofficial informers to the MfS - and by activities of HA XX in
cooperation with HV A, HA II, and friendly security services.[325]
(Figure 15)</p>
<p>According to Boghardt, Heym's <span class="quote">"enlistment in the
AIDS campaign was a major coup for Segal and the HVA."</span>[301] The
term <span class="quote">"enlistment"</span> suggests that Heym became a
knowing participant in disinformation, yet Boghardt and his sources have
not speculated on how the Stasi might have succeeded in recruiting one
of their most resilient victims. Boghardt has also written that <span
class="quote">"like his interviewee [Segal] he [Heym] was probably
unaware of HVA involvement."</span>[301] The implication here is that
the Stasi controlled these two, making them act as they otherwise would
not have acted, that it controlled them so effectively, so cleverly, so
subtly that they <span class="quote">"probably"</span> never caught on.
Heym had been <span class="quote">"enlisted"</span> subliminally. This
implication is not reconcilable with archival findings or live
questioning. Actually, the Stasi initially were aware of neither Heym's
interest nor his Segal interview. Heym's physician, Professor Doctor
Dagobert Müller, had drawn his patient's attention to an item written by
Jakob Segal. [326] Heym immediately grew fascinated by the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth. This was 9 October 1986; in his diary,
unpublished but kindly provided to us by his widow, Inge Heym, he
recorded the date.[327] What was the item his physician had? A copy of
the draft paper received by Bond? A copy of the material Segal had
provided to African journalists? A Harare handout? We know neither what
it was nor how he came to have it. In June 2007, one of us, E.G., gained
access to part of Stefan Heym's estate. There, in a box containing many
AIDS-related books and articles, was nothing likely to have been the
item shown to Heym by his physician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Heym lived in the United States, he worked as the
editor-in-chief of the official German-language magazine of Communist
Party USA.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English_press_of_the_Communist_Party_USA>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English_press_of_the_Communist_Party_USA</a>]</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Heym says: <span class="quote">"He was a
member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the
command of émigré Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts
designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet,
radio and loudspeaker."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Heym>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Heym</a>]
Hans Habe was a Jew who fled from Germany to America in 1940.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Habe>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Habe</a>]
After the Allies dismantled the German press, Habe established 18
newspapers in the US-occupied zone of Germany, and he became the editor
of Germany's primary newspaper.</p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"Mr. [redacted]
emphasizes that Segal and Stefan Heym - writer - are good friends. He
reports that Stefan Heym before he published on the origin of AIDS very
frequently spoke with Segal and that here presumably a connection has to
be registered.[358]"</span> They cited a Stasi file of information
provided by an anonymous informant.</p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle concluded their section on Heym by writing:
<span class="quote">"Was Stefan Heym a recruit? No. He was a
self-deluded writer following a bad lead. He was impetuous enough to
imagine he could judge intuitively what many others knew they could
judge only scientifically and forensically. He set out to tell a story
and ended up among its characters. Thus did this notable victim of
hard-at-work Stasi manage to become, after <em>die Wende</em>, a notable
victim of <em>out-of-work</em> Stasi."</span> But considering Heym's
background as a psychological warfare officer, I have a hard time
believing he was just a useful idiot.</p>
<hr />
<p>A journalist who interviewed Jakob Segal ended up not publishing the
interview because of questions about Segal's heteroduplex
micrographs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This caller was <em>Stern</em> journalist Hans-Herrmann Klare,[334]
who later published a critical review of the myth.[335] He told Heym
that <em>Stern</em> would not publish the interview <span
class="quote">"because of a very simple reason: <u>The fundamental
argument of Segal's chain of evidence in my view collapses</u>
[underlining added by a recipient of the message in the
MfS]."</span></p>
<p>According to Klare, Segal's data regarding the interaction between
the genomes of two different viruses were irreproducible. Klare asked
Heym where Segal had published his experimental data. Heym answered that
the said experiments had not been carried out by Segal himself. Heym
conceded he would not be able to comment on Klare's critique but would
have to call Segal for clarification.[333] (Figure 18)</p>
<p>Heym himself believed he had seen evidence of the phenomenon Segal
had described. In his files at home, Heym had copies of electron
micrographs showing <span class="quote">"these gene threads that stick
together."</span>[333] Heym presumably was referring to electron
micrographs presented by the Segals in several papers.[91,336,337] These
pictures had not been created by Segal or his collaborators but had been
reproduced from a paper already published in early 1985.[338] The <span
class="quote">"gene threads"</span> shown were strains of viral nucleic
acids fused by heteroduplex hybridization, a technique developed in 1961
to estimate the relationship between different species, including
viruses, before more precise evaluations had been made possible by
sequence analysis. Nevertheless, Jakob Segal described the heteroduplex
technique as <span class="quote">"a gene manipulation at the highest
level [<em>Genmanipulation auf höchster Ebene</em>]"</span>[339] - by
1986 a false description.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A Jewish fiction writer wrote a popular novel about the AIDS
theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prominent among the Stasi's surmised successes was inducing a
venerable Austrian author to write a novel advertising the myth as
reality.</p>
<p>Johannes Mario Simmel was born in Vienna in 1924. His father, a
chemist, was a Jew; at the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by
Germany in 1938, the elder Simmel fled to London.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Still more information, especially about how and with what success
the Stasi used Simmel as their instrument, was added by Klaus Behling,
the former GDR diplomat, in a short article in the widely circulated
German newspaper BILD[179] and in an additional book.[365]</p>
<p>Boghardt has written that the <span class="quote">"biggest
coup"</span> of the HV A was to send Simmel <span
class="quote">"material pertaining to Segal's AIDS theory"</span> and
then to find that he had used it as hoped in a work of popular
fiction.[366] The background for this claim was Behling's 8 April 2000
BILD article, <span class="quote">"Stasi eavesdropper: The AIDS lie and
the misused Simmel."</span> Behling had quoted Bohnsack, who</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reveals the disinformation campaigns of the Stasi. By means of
telephone surveillance we learned that Johannes Mario Simmel planned to
write a book on biological weapons. We passed material on to him, [and]
a GDR scientist named Prof. Segal - our IM [our informer] - provided
expertise. In his novel <em>Doch mit den Clowns kamen die Träanen</em>
[<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>] the legend was
disseminated a million times over that the AIDS virus escaped from a
weapons laboratory of the USA. Our aim was to make the Africans angry
against the USA because that plague is most widespread there.[179]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>After the war, Simmel worked as a translator and interpreter for the
United States Office of Military Government in occupied Austria.

<hr />
<p>Erhard Geissler wrote a paper where he debunked Segal in 1987, but he
decided to not publish the paper after a meeting he had with a big wig
at the East German communist party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feist directed E.G. to give him the manuscript, and he, Feist, would
discuss the matter with Karl Seidel, head of the health department of
the Central Committee, <em>das Zentralkomitee</em> or <em>ZK</em>.[384]
After delivering the manuscript, E.G. was to see Seidel, on 9 March.</p>
<p>Seidel was extremely reserved. He made no mention of the manuscript's
factual arguments but emphasized that the CIA of course would appreciate
being absolved of AIDS-related accusations. Then he threatened
distinctly. If E.G. were to publish the manuscript, the leadership of
the Party would assume that he had acted on behalf of the CIA.[385]
Since any such interpretation of his intentions could have been lethal
in East Germany, E.G. decided to forgo publication.</p>
<p>On 11 March 1987, two days after E.G.'s appointment with Seidel, an
anonymous HA XX/1 document noted that Comrade Seidel had been informed
only the day after the appointment, 10 March 1987, about Heym's
interview with Segal. Presumably an officer of HA XX/1, responsible for
public health, had been the informer since an addendum noted: <span
class="quote">"Comrade Prof. Seidel knows the circumstances of the
publication of Prof. Segal's opinions about the AIDS problem and [the
theories that] have been supported by him. Prof. Seidel immediately
realized that any internal discussions of Segal's hypotheses regarding
the origin and spread of AIDS counteract the political [purpose] of
these publications and have to be prevented."</span></p>

<hr />
<p>Christopher Nehring found a memo in the archives of the former
Bulgarian state security service KOMDOS, where the KGB invited KOMDOS to
join the AIDS disinformation campaign, and they outlined the main themes
of the campaign. Two months later part of the text of the memo appeared
in the first article published in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>. However
the memo did not say anything about the Maedi-Visna virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nehring found in the archives of the former Bulgarian state security
service, KOMDOS or COMDOS, a memorandum from the KGB describing a
disinformation campaign designed to misrepresent the origin of HIV. It
was dated 7 September 1985 and marked <span class="quote">"Absolutely
Secret."</span> The KGB's First Main Directorate was writing to
Bulgarian counterparts to enlist their assistance.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Fifth, some of the text in this memorandum would reappear 53 days
later in the Literaturnaya Gazeta article of 30 October 1985, which
itself would repeat nearly word-for-word the allegations already
presented in <em>Patriot</em>.[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The DC Spy Museum historian Thomas Boghardt relied on false
information from the former Stasi disinformation agent Günter
Bohnsack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have supported their interpretation by reference
to the former Stasi officers Bohnsack and Brehmer, who we found
untrustworthy, and by reference to Boghardt, whose confidence in
Bohnsack worked seriously against him. Notably, Boghardt's exposition of
the Segals' contacts with American diplomats - Bohnsack had persuaded
Boghardt these had been Stasi officers impersonating CIA agents
pretending to be American diplomats[29] - we proved to have been
erroneous. One of the American diplomats had gone on to become United
States Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus and kindly described to us
his Segal contacts in detail.[30]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal finished an early draft of his thesis in January 1986, which
was after Seele had presented the Visna hypothesis in December 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No later than 3 October 1985 Segal had come to doubt the African
origin of HIV and mentioned <span class="quote">"strong indications that
AIDS evolved in the US research center for biological warfare in Fort
Detrick by genetic engineering."</span>[31] A first draft of his thesis
was ready by January 1986;[57] Segal's protégé and sometime coauthor
Ronald Dehmlow secretly shared parts of this thesis with HA VII/7, the
MfS department conducting counter-espionage at Dehmlow's place of
work.[58]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal had begun to promote the AIDS conspiracy theory by October 3rd
1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other scientists and conspiracy theorists had already raised it in
HIV-origin context; no later than 3 October 1985,[31] Segal had begun
transforming the myth being propagated by the KGB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 31 said: <span class="quote">"Jakob Segal, letter to Harry

<p>In another paper Geissler wrote that Segal's letter mentioned <span
class="quote">"suspicions [...] that AIDS originated in the US biological
warfare research center Fort Detrick through genetic
manipulation."</span>

I don't know if the letter mentioned Visna.</p>
<hr />
<p>People from Stasi were opposed to Segal's hypothesis and thought it
might harm the reputation of GDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some departments of the Stasi also examined this report. An officer
of the department responsible for counter-intelligence in economic and
scientific affairs informed other departments of the MfS, including the
Regional Administration East Berlin, that <span
class="quote">"[o]fficials of the ministry of Health as well as
Humboldt-University Berlin, who deal with the AIDS problem and with
homosexuality, share the opinion that Segal's claim is not tenable from
a scientific and medical view."</span>[106] Selvage and Nehring have not
mentioned this letter.</p>
<p>Major Dewitz of the Stasi's East Berlin Administration initiated a
comprehensive evaluation of Segal's claims.[107] Dewitz, too, in a
comprehensive four-page memorandum, concluded that <span
class="quote">"all GDR experts are convinced that Prof. Segal's theory
is untenable."</span> But that was a scientific consensus. What Dewitz
described next, though, was a political consensus, that Segal's
activities <span class="quote">"are considered to be politically
harmful"</span> and that spreading the myth generated <span
class="quote">"disadvantages for the GDR"</span> - <span
class="quote">"scientific disadvantages,... economic disadvantages... and
political disadvantages."</span>[108] Consequently, the Stasi, <span
class="quote">"Shield and Sword of the Party,"</span> should not support
but rather should suppress Segal's activities. Major Dewitz went on to
contemplate measures <span class="quote">"[t]o protect the esteem of the
GDR with appropriate measures"</span> by making Segal desist.[109]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At one point Segal claimed that Gallo had created HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greenwald referred to a Segal interview published in an Austrian
journal, Basta. In that interview Segal had not only g/repeated his
allegations but had also asserted that virologist Robert Gallo - along
with Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi a co-discoverer of HIV was
responsible for the creation of the AIDS agent through genetic
manipulation.[141] Later Segal explained that <span class="quote">"the
Pentagon simply purchased Gallo."</span>[142]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Segals may have been presented as French to downplay their ties
to the eastern bloc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September 1986 in <span class="quote">"Pentagon behind
AIDS?"</span> Moscow's New Times referred to <span class="quote">"French
scientists Jacob and Lily [sic] Segal."</span>[145] Later the GDR's
Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs described Jakob Segal as
French.[135,138] But the Ministry of State Security - the MfS or Stasi -
knew Segal was a citizen of the Soviet Union. USDoS also knew this:
<span class="quote">"Throughout the early and middle stages of the
disinformation campaign, Soviet-bloc media repeatedly misidentified
Segal as a French national."</span> USDoS assumed disinformation in
<span class="quote">"an effort to downplay his ties to the
G.D.R."</span> But USDoS also suggested not disinformation but
<em>misinformation</em>: <span class="quote">"Segal, who resides in East
Berlin but claims to have graduated from the Sorbonne in 1940, has been
repeatedly misidentified as a French researcher."</span>[146]</p>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have seen here only disinformation: an attempt to
hide Segal's ties to East Berlin ties that Segal himself made patently
obvious again and again. Pretending Segal was French, Selvage and
Nehring have proposed, would have been advantageous since <span

already authored 20 novels, numerous screenplays, and various short
stories and children's books. His works had been translated into 25
languages and sold over 65 million copies. By sheer coincidence, HVA
Department III (electronic surveillance) recorded a phone conversation
referencing Simmel's project and forwarded a copy to Department X. The
disinformation specialists spotted an opportunity and decided to
anonymously send Simmel material pertaining to Segal's AIDS

provided Segal with background papers since it learned about the
spreading of the myth first in September 1986 from foreign press reports
and its own surveillance of US diplomats' activities."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 1987, HVA X gave Segal material <span class="quote">"from
secret service circles"</span> on the 1969 congressional testimony of
Donald MacArthur, then deputy director of research and engineering in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In his testimony, MacArthur
stated that <span class="quote">"within a period of five to 10 years it
would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have
been acquired."</span> He elaborated further that <span class="quote">"A
research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed
in approximately five years at a total cost of $10
million."</span>[100]</p>
<p>For Segal, the MacArthur testimony was near-certain evidence that the
Pentagon had not only contemplated an HIV-type virus since 1969 but also
had gone through with the project within the 10-year time frame
MacArthur had suggested. Henceforth, MacArthur's testimony became a
cornerstone of Segal's conspiracy theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacArthur's testimony is also frequently quoted by Nick the
Spacecat.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote that Segal later started to blame Gallo for creating
the virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his earlier publications and utterances, Segal had dispassionately
and largely accurately described Gallo's contribution to the
identification of HIV, but he sharply changed his tack in the late
1980s, when Gallo became the key figure in Segal's theory. In his final
years, Segal developed an apparent pathological hatred of Gallo as the
man personally responsible for creating AIDS, and he seized every
opportunity to lambast the American scientist.</p>
<p>In 1989, just one year before East Germany's demise, Segal went on a
lecture tour across West Germany. Even though the SED leadership had
avoided endorsing Segal and he did not travel as an official GDR
representative, his trip was inconceivable without the Politburo's
knowledge and approval. In his presentations, Segal touted his latest
piece of evidence - the MacArthur hearing of 1969 - and pilloried
Gallo.[103] According to the recollections of one of his listeners,
Segal referred to Gallo as <span class="quote">"a huge gangster"</span>
[ein ganz grosser Gangster] who was responsible for creating the
virus.[104]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Segal's last major accomplishment during the Cold War was the
publication in 1990 of his book <em>AIDS - die Spur führt ins
Pentagon</em> [<em>AIDS - the trail leads to the Pentagon</em>], which
incorporated the bits on Gallo and the MacArthur hearing into his
original thesis. The book was published by <em>Neuer Weg</em>, a
publishing house closely associated with the far-left, Maoist Marxist
Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD).</p>

<a href=#Lilli_Segal id=Lilli_Segal>Lilli Segal</a>
</h2>
<p>A biography of Lilli Segal said:
[<a href=https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/>https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His second wife, Edith Albrecht, threatened to denounce Lilli to the
police as a communist, to make her leave the shared residence. Because
of the tightening restrictions for Jews in Germany, Lilli moved to
France in 1933 and studied at the Toulouse University of
Agriculture.</p>
<p>During her stay in Toulouse she met the student Jakob Segal, a
Lithuanian national, who was a member of the German Communist Party
(KPD). He had immigrated to France because of his involvement in the
communist <span class="quote">'Red Student Union'</span>. They married
on May 25, 1935 and Lilli was given Lithuanian citizenship by virtue of
the marriage, which made her a citizen of the Soviet Union from
1940.</p>
<p>Due to her non-German nationality, Lilli Segal was able to travel to
Germany without any difficulties after 1935. During these trips she took
on several missions for the KPD without being a member of the party.
These were among other things the housing of endangered comrades, the
production and distribution of leaflets, and courier activities. In
addition, she remained in contact with a group of Bavarian Catholic
officers who were opponents of the Hitler regime. They provided her with
money for political work.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of war, Lilli Segal worked in a laboratory in
Paris from 1937. She joined the French Communist Party, with which she
was regularly involved until the beginning of the war. Because they
feared that she was under surveillance by the Gestapo, the French
comrades broke off the connection with her.</p>
<p>When Germany occupied France, she left Paris and lived in Mende. In
the summer of 1943 party leaders decided to transfer Lilli Segal to the
same working group as her husband, because both had lived together for a
long time and worked in the same office.</p>
<p>From 1943 until her arrest she worked as a so-called liaison agent
for her husband, who worked at the technical headquarters of a party
section which dealt with transporting materials, as well as the contact
management of liaisons with the headquarters.</p>
<p>The persecution of party official Paul Grasse led the police to their
office in the summer of 1943. With the arrest of a number of German and
Austrian party comrades on November 23rd Paul Grasse also
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lilli Segal was also questioned by the French police (see picture
above) at the Prefecture de Police. She was not cooperative and was
arrested as a result. After a month, she was handed over by the French
police to the German run jail of Fresnes, where she remained until the
end of June 1944.</p>
<p>At the end of June, she was taken to Drancy, and after a month, on 31
July 1944, Lilli Segal was deported to Auschwitz in Convoi 77. In the
train, she made contact with two Austrian comrades; one of them was Anni
Sussmann, with whom she was transferred in November 1944 to a Labour
unit at Kratzau in the Sudetenland. (1)</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>After returning to France, Lilli Segal continued working for the
French Communist Party until 1947. (5) Since it became prohibited for
Soviet citizens to work for a political party abroad, she left France
together with her husband, Jakob Segal, and they emigrated to the German
Democratic Republic. From 1948 she worked in the GDR in various official
political organizations, e.g. as an interpreter. (1)</p>

<p>In the <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper,
Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"The Segals had both
become Soviet citizens following the Soviet Union's annexation of
Lithuania in 1940, and in autumn 1952, as Lilli later wrote, <span
class="quote">'they had been asked to see the Soviet consulate [in

Democratic Republic.'</span>[75] They accepted the consul's proposal, in

She may have also produced disinformation about the Holocaust and not
only HIV. She claims that she was personally selected by Josef Mengele
when she arrived to Auschwitz, which is a common trope among Auschwitz
survivors. Like many Auschwitz survivors, she incorrectly said that
Mengele was tall. She also repeated the cliches that Mengele held a whip
in his hand, and that he was somehow elegant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone called out: <span class="quote">"Old people and women with
children to the right, women to the left."</span> SS men stood on the
platform and pushed us forward with their rifle butts. For the first
time we heard the commands that would accompany us throughout our entire
time in the camps: <span class="quote">"Move! Move! Faster! Stay in
line!"</span> Stumbling, we pressed forward, into the glare of the
spotlight, past an elegant, tall, dark-haired officer, who poked at the
marchers with the butt of his whip, directing them to the group of the
old people and children, or to the other side. Dr. Mengele! He was
whistling, quite audibly, a melody from Wagner's Goetterdaemmerung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his biography of Mengele, the Jewish mainstream historian David
Marwell wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Historian Zdenek Zofka notes that many survivors recall Mengele
speaking to them in Hungarian, a language he did not speak but which was
spoken by his colleagues, the pharmacist Viktor Capesius and the
physician Dr. Fritz Klein. <span class="quote">"Often Mengele would be
described as tall and blond, when he was only 5ft 8½ inches tall and
dark-haired."</span>[31] <span class="quote">"Almost all inmates"</span>
at Auschwitz, according to Zofka, maintain that they had been selected
by Mengele.</p>
<p>Hermann Langbein, a former Auschwitz inmate and author of the
authoritative People in Auschwitz, wrote of this phenomenon, which he
deemed the <span class="quote">"Mengele Effect,"</span> a particular
form of <span class="quote">"memory displacement"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a member of the SS is repeatedly named in public in connection
with especially monstrous deeds, it is possible that survivors will
project their experiences on to him. ... More than once I heard survivors
say that Mengele did this or that to them, even though Mengele had not
yet arrived in Auschwitz at the time. Olga Lengyel has described him as
a blonde angel, even though Mengele was a markedly dark-haired type. In
short, crimes of an anonymous SS physician were imputed to Mengele,
about whom people had read so many bad things. ...</p>
<p>Some well-known SS men have been positively idealized after the fact.
Thus Fania Fénelon has called Mengele a <span class="quote">"handsome
Siegfried,"</span> and Therese Chassaing writes, <span
class="quote">"Mengele is immaculate in his belted uniform, tall, with
shiny black boots that bespeak cleanliness, prosperity, and human
dignity."</span> Elie Wiesel mentions as one of Mengele's characteristic
attributes <span class="quote">"white gloves, a monocle, and the
rest."</span>[32]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Langbein saw Mengele <span class="quote">"almost every day in the
office of the SS infirmary where he was doing routine bureaucratic
work,"</span> and he claims that Mengele never struck him as either
attractive or elegant. He never saw him with a monocle. Doris Bergen,
describing the work of Israeli historian Na'ama Shik, wrote about the
<span class="quote">"so-called Mengele Effect,"</span> noting that
survivors' accounts decades after the fact could be shaped by what <span
class="quote">"they have read and heard in the meantime."</span>[33]</p>
<p>Geoffrey Hartmann, who wrote extensively on survivor testimony,
observed that <span class="quote">"every Auschwitz survivor seems to
have gone through a selection by Mengele, as if he manned his post 24
hours a day."</span>[34] In fact, Mengele took his turn at <span
class="quote">"ramp duty"</span> like the rest of the medical staff in
the camp. There is no evidence that he served there more frequently or
for longer hours than his colleagues.</p>

Lehrman presented Duesberg's theory that HIV did not cause AIDS, but on
the other hand he also presented the theory of the Segals that HIV was a
bioweapon, and he reconciled the two theories by asking: <span
class="quote">"Might the virus then be a laboratory-created, minimally
infective agent intended to be blamed for the chemical poisoning it
actually accompanies?"</span> In the fashion of Sasha Latypova, he
proposed that AIDS was caused by an unspecified poison or toxic
substance.</p>

<p>I found an article about someone called Konstantin Kapitonov, who was
a Russian intelligence operative masquerading as a journalist, and who
used to work as an Egyptian correspondent of <em>Literaturnaya
Gazeta</em>. The article mentioned that <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
also published a story about CIA creating weaponized mosquitoes:

<p>In 1982, Kapitonov was dispatched to Beirut as a correspondent of

which was actually the KGB's <span class="quote">"prime conduit in the
Soviet press for propaganda and disinformation,"</span> according to
former KGB General Oleg Kalugin. The year Kapitonov left Moscow for
Beirut, <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> published a long story titled,
<span class="quote">"Incubator of Death,"</span> about a CIA factory for
weaponized mosquitoes. The story was a response to the American
accusations that the Soviet army had used chemical weapons in
Afghanistan, and was designed to deflect blame.</p>
<p>The network of <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>'s foreign bureaus around
the world was essentially a joint enterprise sponsored by the KGB. The
weekly got bureaus, and KGB spies were given journalistic cover.</p>

<p>The author of the article was Andrei Soldatov, who is the editor

[<a href=https://agentura.ru/en/about/>https://agentura.ru/en/about/</a>]</p>
<p>In the book <em>Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation
and Political Warfare</em>, Thomas Rid wrote that the story about the
weaponized mosquitoes was supposed to be based on leaked documents that
were provided to a Russian journalist by an editor of CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast dark cloud of billions of buzzing mosquitoes swarms toward a
distant city skyline. The lead mosquito's legs are armored with spikes,
its eyes and mouth so magnified they appear gigantic. At second glance,
the creature's mouth is not that of a normal mosquito, but an
engineered, razor-sharp syringe. The swarm is emanating from the dark
eye sockets of a human skull, a skull smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>This bizarre illustration appeared in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
on February 3, 1982, above a long story titled <span
class="quote">"Incubator of Death."</span> The piece, written in the
first person, was a kind of travelogue into a CIA factory for weaponised
mosquitoes. The author, Iona Andronov, started his adventure after
visiting the editor of <span class="quote">"the journal <span
class="quote">'Covert Action'</span> in Washington,"</span> (a reference
to <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>). That Washington editor
showed Andronov, he claimed, <span class="quote">"leaked documents from
the CIA"</span> that led his investigation to Lahore, Pakistan. En route
from Moscow to Lahore, Andronov recounted, his luggage was taken away
during a layover, then he was followed by Pakistani security, and
diplomatic phone numbers appeared to mysteriously stop working. American
spies were on his heels. Nevertheless, the intrepid reporter managed to
charm his way into the secret mosquito lab.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The killer mosquito story was part of a larger, more complex campaign
to deflect blame, and to compromise the U.S. and NATO over biological
and chemical weapons. The campaign was code-named TARAKANY, <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> in Russian. Even if the Soviet claim
that the CIA was developing chemical weapons in Lahore was revealed as
fake, that revelation would make it easier for the USSR to claim that
the CIA's reports of Soviet chemical weapons in Afghanistan were equally
made-up. Just when the United States was getting ready to publish a
major report on Soviet chemical weapons, <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
alleged that the Pakistan Malaria Research Center was a CIA-funded
laboratory to breed weaponized mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The story was clumsy but creative. Iona Andronov depicted the
Americans he met in the <span class="quote">"mosquito factory"</span> as
cartoonish villains - fat, fiendish, crude, and cunning. The University
of Maryland lab in Lahore and its fight against malaria, he claimed, was
only a façade; behind it were <span class="quote">"poisoners from
overseas"</span> who plotted to infect entire cattle herds with viruses
and then take advantage of the seasonal migration of the herds from
Pakistan to Afghanistan to start an epidemic of encephalitis in
Afghanistan. The Gazeta story also claimed that a recent outbreak of
dengue fever in Cuba had been caused by imported Lahore-bred mosquitoes.
TARAKANY replayed similar tales about U.S. killer germs in India, Iran,
Bangladesh, Lebanon, and South Africa. The KGB considered its <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> campaign a big success, especially
after Service A concluded that Pakistan had declared the American head
of the University of Maryland lab in Lahore persona non grata as a
result of their work. Andropov, the chairman of the KGB, even awarded a
testimonial to his resident in Pakistan.[3]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Just a few months later, <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>
published a special issue on chemical weapons. The Bulletin also claimed
that the same virulent 1981 outbreak of dengue fever in Cuba had been a
CIA operation - it was unclear whether the idea originated at Dupont
Circle or Yasenevo.[4] The Soviets launched an entire range of measures
in the early 1980s that attempted to blame various diseases on the
United States, particularly the Cuban outbreak of dengue fever.[5]</p>

<p>The story about the weaponized mosquitoes sounds just like a story
concocted by George Webb. It's only missing encrypted Blackberries and a
nuclear deal.</p>

</h2>
<p>In the book <em>Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation
and Political Warfare</em>, Thomas Rid wrote that when CAIB's founder
Philip Agee lived in London, he maintained contact with the KGB through
the London correspondent of <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day Agee approached the KGB rezidentura in Mexico City and
offered what one senior Soviet intelligence officer later called <span
class="quote">"reams of information about CIA operations."</span>[26]
The KGB Mexico station chief, however, suspected that Agee was a CIA
plant, what spies then called a <span class="quote">"dangle,"</span> an
undercover agent posing as a defector in order to inject disinformation
into the KGB, and rejected Agee. Agee then went to Cuba's foreign
intelligence agency, the Dirección General de Inteligencia, or DGI,
which welcomed its first high-profile CIA source with open arms and soon
shared Agee's file with the KGB.[27] Oleg Kalugin recalled the
disappointment of failing to recruit the American quasi-defector
himself: <span class="quote">"The Cubans shared Agee's information with
us. But as I sat in my office in Moscow, reading reports about the
growing list of revelations coming from Agee, I cursed our officers for
turning away such a prize."</span>[28]</p>
<p>In December 1971, Agee moved from Mexico to Paris, where he lived
hand-to-mouth at different addresses in the Fifth Arrondissement. It was
then that he began to entertain the idea of writing a tell-all book on
the CIA. From late 1972 to mid-1977, he lived first in London, then in
Truro, Cornwall, and finally in Cambridge, maintaining contact with the
KGB through the <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> correspondent in
London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>British authorities accused Agee of being a Soviet bloc influence
agent, and he was deported from the UK in 1977. After that he founded
CAIB. In the third issue of CAIB, he published a fake appendix to a US
intelligence manual which was written by the KGB according to Rid. CAIB
is supposed to have received the fake appendix from a person who
presented himself as an anonymous US Army whistleblower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1992, the head of Russian foreign intelligence, Yevgeny Primakov,

<p>The head of the Foreign Intelligence Service issued a series of truly
sensational announcements. He recalled the well-known articles published
several years ago in our national newspapers about the alleged origins
of AIDS in secret Pentagon laboratories. According to Yevgeny Primakov,
the materials revealing the American scientists' <span
class="quote">"forged"</span> plot against humanity were concocted in
the offices of the KGB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Russian text said: <span class="quote">"По словам Е.
Примакова, материалы, раскрывающие «кованый» замысел американских ученых
против человечества, выдуманы в кабинетах КГБ."</span> (Where the word
<span class="quote">"кабинет"</span> means an office and not a filing
cabinet.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal's booklet was distributed in 1986 in the Eighth
Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Harare, Zimbabwe. Rid wrote that
the conference served as a channel for the distribution of other Soviet
disinformation material, along with a list of CIA officers similar to
the list that was later published by CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KGB was running DENVER as a joint campaign with help from partner
agencies.[31] Ten days after the conference, the deputy head of the X,
Wolfgang Mutz, traveled from Berlin to his partners in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Mutz briefed his counterparts on a long list of ongoing active measures.
One, code-named MIRROR, also boosted in Harare ten days earlier, was a
slim book nominally written by the East Berlin correspondent of
<em>Patriot</em> and <em>Blitz</em>, an investigative Indian weekly. The
book, <em>Devil and His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third
World</em>, was dripping with anti-American clichés and CIA conspiracy
theories. Mutz told the Bulgarians that it contained a list with the
names of 300 CIA officers,[32] again titled, like HVA's earlier volume,
<em>Who's Who in CIA</em>.[33] The Americans, Mutz added, had already
bought 600 copies of <span class="quote">"our book"</span> from the
publisher.[34] HVA had the book translated and published in German. The
Bulgarians agreed to help push the anti-CIA pamphlet into Lebanon and
Syria.</p>
<p>Then Mutz told his counterparts that the AIDS campaign, DENVER,
occupied <span class="quote">"a considerable amount"</span> of the
resources in his department, and added that another HVA department had
done <span class="quote">"a great deal of scientific work."</span> Mutz
was referring to the 52-page Segal study that had surfaced in Harare,
and to HVA's science and technology department, which listed Segal as a
collaborator.[35] The Bulgarians considered it challenging to find a
local scientist to <span class="quote">"support the German professor's
thesis."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 35 referred to pages 55-57 of the book <em>Die
AIDS-Verschwörung</em> by Selvage and Nehring.</p>
<hr />
<p>Part of the objective of HV A/X was to a break up NATO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 1966, Markus Wolf was called to a meeting in Moscow
on short notice, to meet the first deputy chief of the KGB's First Chief
Directorate. After speaking about the wider context, the officer
deferred to Igor Agayants, the head of Service A.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Comrades,"</span> Agayants intoned, <span
class="quote">"this strategic assessment requires a new quality of
active measures, clear strategies leading into the 70s and effective
measures that go beyond merely destructive methods."</span> Agayants
rearticulated the strategic objective that had been set by the Central
Committee: <span class="quote">"The long-term goal is to remove the USA
from the so-called Atlantic Alliance."</span>[8]</p>
<p>Wolf got the message. On the flight back, he began sketching out
plans to upgrade the HVA's own disinformation unit, and the X was
born.[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coordinators of the Segal disinformation campaign included Wolfgang
Mutz and Hans Pfeiffer. Mutz was the deputy head of HV A/X, and Pfeiffer
was the deputy head of department 1 of HV A/X, which was <span
class="quote">"responsible for active measures intended to provoke or
intensify differences between the USA and its NATO allies"</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>When the 1972 Olympics were organized in West Germany, Stasi launched
a campaign to portray West Germans as neo-Nazis. The Stasi collaborated
with the Bulgarian state security agency COMDOS, which later also took
part in the disinformation operation about AIDS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next, Wagenbreth's unit forged a leaflet that purported to come from
the organizers of the neo-Nazi youth congress. The faux leaflet called
for a stronger far-right movement in order to <span class="quote">"free
Europe,"</span> as it approvingly quoted the secretary of the 1936
Olympics Games, and highlighted that the games in 1972 also were not
global but European, <span class="quote">"reflecting the racist
understanding of the superiority of European nations,"</span> as the X
explained in an internal memo.[40] HVA operatives posed as far-right
extremists, even threatening violent action[41] to escalate the
confrontation between West German police and the radical right, to <span
class="quote">"engage their forces in the fight against
extremists."</span>[42] The Stasi distributed the pamphlet to the press
and various national Olympic committees.</p>
<p>A few months before the games began, the Stasi's acting head of
disinformation met with a delegation of the Bulgarian disinformation
unit in East Berlin. The X leadership informed the Bulgarians that they
were preparing a range of additional measures under the ZEUS code name,
including threatening letters sent from supposed right-wing extremists
to the federal and state interior ministries in Bonn and Munich.
Department X also suggested sending another batch of letters to the same
interior ministries, this time purportedly from <span
class="quote">"emigrant organizations"</span> in Germany, in order to
<span class="quote">"create compromising materials on the basis of which
arrests and liquidations of emigrant organizations could be carried
out."</span> Major Hans Knaust of the HVA asked Bulgarian state security
for help in distributing the racist leaflets to newspapers in Turkey,
Italy, Greece, and Arab countries in order to harm West Germany's image
and <span class="quote">"strengthen disagreements between NATO
countries."</span>[43]</p>

<a href=#Valentin_Zapevalov id=Valentin_Zapevalov>Valentin Zapevalov</a>
</h2>
<p>Russian-language Wikipedia had interesting details about Valentin
Zapevalov:
[<a href=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич>https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Запевалов%2c_Валентин_Васильевич</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1977-1983, he was a staff correspondent for the USSR State
Television and Radio Broadcasting Company in the FRG. Since the autumn
of 1985, he worked in the international department of the
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>[3], and in 1985-1996, he was the
newspaper's staff correspondent in Bonn (Federal Republic of Germany).
In 1996-1998, he was the head of the international department of LG.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>During his years working in Germany, Zapevalov regularly appeared on
the talk show <span class="quote">"Internazionale Frühschoppen"</span>
on the German television channel ARD, hosted by Werner Höffer, a former
Goebbels propagandist who had undergone social adaptation.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>From January 1999 to February 2001, at the invitation of government
official and former foreign intelligence officer Grigory Rapota,
Zapevalov became head of the public relations bureau of the state-owned
companies Rosvooruzhenie and Rosoboronexport.</p>
<p>[....]</p>
<p>In his memoirs and the accompanying interview, Zapevalov described
his role as a foreign correspondent as something between a diplomat and
an intelligence officer, expressing confidence that <span
class="quote">"it's unlikely that politicians would refuse such a good
channel of communication even now."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zapevalov appears to be an ethnic Russian from Estonia and not a Jew.
In an interview in 2018, Zapevalov said:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926203029/http://inforing.net/publications/infopress/culture.php?ELEMENT_ID=44648>https://web.archive.org/web/20200926203029/http://inforing.net/publications/infopress/culture.php?ELEMENT_ID=44648</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were some very talented journalists, real golden pens, at
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>: Yuri Shchekochikhin, Arkady Vaksberg,
Anatoly Rubinov - his real name was Abram Zalmanovich... When I came to
LG, 90 percent of the staff were Jews. And when I needed to fit in, I
said, <span class="quote">"I'm from Estonia, and my mother's name is
Senne-Heleene Alfredi tytar Sorgus, it's an Estonian surname."</span> To
which they replied, <span class="quote">"Valya, we're all Estonians

<h2>
<a href=#Executive_Intelligence_Review_on_AIDS id=Executive_Intelligence_Review_on_AIDS>Executive
Intelligence Review on AIDS</a>
</h2>
<p>On October 18th 1985, LaRouche's <em>Executive Intelligence
Review</em> published an interview of John Seale titled <span
class="quote">"AIDS and the security of the Western world"</span>.
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n41-19851018/eirv12n41-19851018_054-dr_john_seale.pdf>https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n41-19851018/eirv12n41-19851018_054-dr_john_seale.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>At the time AIDS had not yet spread to the Soviet Union, so Seale
speculated that the Soviets might be trying to make AIDS spread faster
in the west by encouraging homosexuality and drug use, or by promoting
disinformation about how AIDS spreads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote as long ago as May 4, 1983, over two years ago, to the bureau
chief of Newsweek in London, and to the bureau chief of Time magazine in
London. In the letter, I wrote: <span class="quote">"If my hypothesis is
correct, and we wait perhaps 20 years before we take drastic' preventive
action, half the population of the Western world will be wiped out.
Meanwhile, the communist countries, sheltering behind their closed
frontiers, will watch capitalism collapse in a way never predicted by
Marx."</span></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>And I wrote a letter on Aug. 19 to the editors of the major London
papers and to four or five of the major medical journals. It's headed
<span class="quote">"AIDS and National Security."</span> What I said
was: <span class="quote">"Once the AIDS virus gets into an intravenous
drug abusing community, it spreads even faster than among homosexuals.
Long before even half the NATO forces and their reservists were infected
with the AIDS virus, the West would be a pushover for the Soviets.
Employing the AIDS virus is much less messy and self-destructive than
using nuclear weapons or nerve gas. Its spread is easily prevented in a
totalitarian state, unlike incoming missiles containing nuclear or
chemical warheads. The Soviets did not deliberately start the AIDS
epidemic as a form of biological warfare, but only a moron or an idiot
in the Krenuin could fail to see its potential in the East-West power
struggle, now that it is here. Gorbachov could easily contain the AIDS
epidemic behind the Iron Curtain using methods far less draconian than
those employed by Stalin in the '20s and '30s. And if he makes sure that
heroin and cocaine keep flooding into the West, and the porno industry
keeps pumping out propaganda glorifying ever more promiscuous and
bizarre effects, he could be laughing all the way to world domination by
about the year 2000."</span></p>
<p>I did write a letter for publication to the editors of the Times, the
Telegraph, and the Guardian on Sept. 3, the 46th anniversary of the
outbreak of World War II as far as the British were concerned. I asked a
number of questions: Can the totalitarian Soviet system easily prevent
the spread of the AIDS virus? The answer, I am sure, is <span
class="quote">"yes."</span> Another very important question: Can the
speed with which the AIDS virus spreads amongst our people be
accelerated by actively encouraginga permissive attitude toward drug
abuse, homosexual promiscuity, and various bizarre forms of heterosexual
anal sex. And the answer is, obviously, <span
class="quote">"yes."</span> And then, would the provision of
disinformation and misinformation in the West about the many ways in
which the virus is really spread, would that speed up transmission? And
the answer clearly is <span class="quote">"yes."</span> My last two
questions were: Does the Politburo in Moscow believe that the answer to
all these questions is <span class="quote">"yes"</span>? Has World War
III already started?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article Seale did not yet say that AIDS was an engineered
bioweapon, and he said AIDS had been in Africa longer than the west. He
did not yet mention the Visna recombination theory, but he only said:
<span class="quote">"This is like what is known with other so-called
slow virus diseases - one or two rare ones are known to occur in man -
but is very like the disease known as visna, which occurs in sheep. What
has now transpired is that the virus which causes this progressive btain
disease in sheep is extremely similar in its nucleitide sequence, or
genetically, to the AIDS virus."</span> (However the reference genome of
HIV-1 has only about 50% nucleotide similarity to the reference genome
of Visna if you ignore positions with gaps, or about 40% if you don't
ignore positions with gaps, which is hardly <span
class="quote">"extremely similar"</span>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>In order to find more articles about AIDS in EIR, I tried searching
Google for <code>site:larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985 aids</code>.</p>
<p>I found an article from October 1985 by Warren Hamerman titled <span
class="quote">"The Soviets are covering up the deadly AIDS
pandemic"</span>.
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n42-19851025/eirv12n42-19851025_026-the_soviets_are_covering_up_the.pdf>https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n42-19851025/eirv12n42-19851025_026-the_soviets_are_covering_up_the.pdf</a>]
He said that he was the <span class="quote">"Director of the EIR's
Biological Holocaust Task Force"</span>, and he wrote <span
class="quote">"For most of this year, high officials of the U. S.
government have systematically rejected Executive Intelligence Review's
attempts to raise the national security implications of the global AIDS
pandemic and declare a full-scale War on AIDS."</span></p>
<p>He wrote <span class="quote">"The entire chain of command within the
WHO responsible for AIDS surveillance programs and information is under
explicit Warsaw Pact Command."</span> He also said that the WHO
controlled the CDC, and he wrote: <span class="quote">"The lethal
pandemic is infecting tens of millions in the West, while the Soviets
chortle that they have no native-born AIDS cases. We now know why EIR's
requests for national security action have been rejected. The Soviets
have been running the global command and control of all AIDS policies
through WHO. How convenient."</span></p>
<p>So apparently other authors at EIR also had similar views as John
Seale.</p>
<p>A month later November 22nd 1985, EIR published an article where
Warren Hamerman claimed that the first <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
article was published in response to his article in EIR:
[<a href=https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n46-19851122/eirv12n46-19851122_006-journal_admits_aids_could_be_bio.pdf>https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1985/eirv12n46-19851122/eirv12n46-19851122_006-journal_admits_aids_could_be_bio.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the journal <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> on Oct. 30, for the
first time in history anywhere in the world, the Soviets have admitted
the possibility that the deadly AIDS virus could have been <span
class="quote">"bioengineered"</span> and worked up into a weapon in a
military laboratory. The extaordinary Soviet admission that it was
technically possible to prepare a virus like AIDS as a biological
warfare agent came in the context of an article which featured an attack
on EIR and its founder, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. EIR had published a
cover story titled <span class="quote">"Soviet Role in Covering Up the
Deadly Threat of AIDS"</span> in its Oct. 25, 1985 isssue.</p>
<p>The <em>EIR</em> expose reported that Dr. Sergei K. Litvinov and
other top officials of Warsaw Pact nations run the Communicable Disease
Division of the Geneva-based World, Health Organization (WHO), placing
them in charge of all AIDS work. Five days later, Moscow responded like
a wounded bear. In its defensive rage, the bear revealed more about its
own maraudings than about its victims.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The Literaturnaya Gazeta article builds in intensity to an
extraordinary conclusion in the fonn of a <span
class="quote">"postscript"</span> attack on Lyndon LaRouche and EIR
directly. The postscript reads in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. While this material was in preparation, the American magazine
<em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> published a <span
class="quote">"sensational"</span> notice to the effect that the Soviet
Union was blocking the fight against AIDS. Note that this publication is
one of the press organs of the extreme rightwing American grouping of
LaRouche, known for his ties to the CIA. It is not excluded that the
publication in the <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> is nothing but
a clumsy attempt to cover up the tracks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Therefore, the EIR Biological Holocaust Task Force has intensified
its investigation into the Soviet role in the spread of the 100% lethal
AIDS pandemic. Currently under preparation is a scientific evaluation of
the basic Soviet biophysics capability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't remember hearing about the postscript that mentioned EIR
before. I haven't found the full text of the <em>Literaturnaya
Gazeta</em> article anywhere so I could verify if it actually contains
the postscript. But anyway, KGB had clearly started planning for the
AIDS operation before Hamerman's article was published in October 1985,
and the KGB even sent the memo to Bulgarian COMDOS in September
1985.</p>
<hr />
<p>In November 1986 the EIR published an article by Criton Zoakos, who
wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Charles Z. Wick employs in the USIA one Herbert Romerstein, a former
Communist Party youth leader, as an expert for combatting KGB
<em>dezinformatsia</em> projects. His credentials for the job were
supplied by Roy Godson, formerly of the National Strategy Information
Center, and more recently, head of a project to study Soviet
disinformation techniques at Georgetown University's Center for
Strategic and disinformation techniques at Georgetown University's
Center for Strategic and International Studies, the current home of
ex-National Security Advisers Robert McFarlane, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and
Henry Kissinger. Roy Godson, Romerstein's patron, is also a <span
class="quote">"former communist,"</span> strongly influenced, throughout
his life, by Jay Lovestone, one of the founders of the Communist
Party-U.S.A., together with Dr. Armand Hammer's father Julius Hammer.
Herbert Romerstein, as member of a State Department USIA Interagency
Working Group on Soviet Disinformation, traveled to London some time
after Surgeon-General Koop's return from Moscow, and discussed with an
associate of his, Ian Elliott, editor of <em>Soviet Analyst</em>
magazine, a project to discredit Dr. John Seale, a member of the Royal
College of Physicians and outspoken backer of Proposition 64, as a <span
class="quote">"Soviet disinformation channel."</span> On Oct. 31, Ian
Elliott, citing <span class="quote">"ex-communist"</span> Herbert
Romerstein as his authority, alleged that Dr. Seale had charged that
<span class="quote">"U. S. intelligence"</span> had artificially
manufactured the AIDS virus and that that allegation had been picked up
by Soviet publications which, supposedly, were about to have a
propagandistic field day. Though Dr. Seale protested the absurdities of
the Ian Elliott piece, three days later, at a State Department briefing,
Herbert Romerstein's slander reappeared under new wrapping. Department
spokesman Charles Redman presented a document, produced by the
Interagency Working Group on Soviet disinformation, denouncing the
Soviets for alleging that the U.S.A. artificially produced the AIDS
virus for biowarfare purposes. So far, so good. But, inside the
otherwise very true charges against the Soviet disinformation practices,
was embedded the lie that Dr. Seale was part of the Soviet

<p>In fact even in the book <span class="quote">"AIDS and the Doctors of

primate (monkey, chimp) animal cancer research whereby primates were

<p>Based on in-depth research into the files of the former state party
SED, the East German Ministry of Health, and MfS service units in the
BStU archives, molecular biologist and bioethicist Erhard Geißler
concluded that J. Segal's <span class="quote">"propaganda
campaign"</span> was <span class="quote">"by no means"</span> a
disinformation campaign by the MfS.[7] There is no evidence in the BStU
archives that the HV A played a role in the creation or dissemination of
the various versions of Segal's hypothesis.[8] Geißler found important
sources on the SED government's AIDS policy in the holdings of the other
MfS service units in the BStU archive, as well as sources concerning the
activities of Jakob and Lilli Segal and the negative reaction of most
East German experts to Segal's AIDS thesis. Based on these sources, he
concluded that the MfS only learned of Segal's thesis in September
1986.[9] However, Geißler did not, or did not visibly, reflect on the
fact that the HV A's archives, which shed light on the HV A's
activities, are in fact not available for research. The lack of evidence
of any influence by the HV A does not constitute proof of its
inactivity, but is primarily due to the current state of sources.
Findings of influence or non-influence on the Segals and their research
by the MfS must be evaluated against this background.</p>
<p>However, the authors of this study have uncovered new documents on
the KGB's disinformation campaign and the accompanying role of the HV A
in the archives of the former Security and Intelligence Services of
Bulgaria (AKRDOPBGDSRSBNA or COMDOS-A) in Sofia and, thanks to
inferences from these files, also in the archives of the Federal Office
of State Security (BStU) in Berlin. They also drew on the former HV A
database (SIRA: System of Information Research of the HV A)[10] and the
(partial) index card of the HV A <span
class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span>[11], two sources that have not been
used in previous research.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One example of this is the journalistic activity of the American
psychiatrist Nathaniel S. Lehrman, who - apparently unknowingly - acted
as a multiplier of the KGB's disinformation on AIDS in the USA. In
various articles for the New York-based African-American newspaper <span
class="quote">"Amsterdam News,"</span> he hinted at a possible <span
class="quote">"AIDS conspiracy"</span> by the American government. In
November 1985, he allegedly claimed to the newspaper that the spread of
the AIDS epidemic in parts of Africa was the result of CIA
bacteriological and chemical experiments; that similar experiments were
openly conducted on Western homosexuals, drug addicts, and African
Americans; and that the Centers for Disease Control had participated in
CIA experiments. All three claims fit Zapevalov's article in
Literaturnaya Gazeta and the guidance the KGB had given the Bulgarians.
Beyond the KGB's theories, Lehrman claimed that chemical agents were
likely responsible for AIDS and that the associated HTL virus caused
only a mild infection.[77] Lehrman later denied in a letter to the
editor of the Amsterdam News[78] and in a press release[79] that he had
ever made the first three KGB-related claims.</p>
<p>In the February [1986] press release, he focused more on his thesis
that there might be a chemical agent causing AIDS.[80] However, in his
letter to the editor, he left open the possibility that the <span
class="quote">"spread of AIDS in Africa could be the result of
activities by the American government, including the CIA."</span>[81] In
the press release, he softened his statement on alleged human
experiments, which was summarized in the newspaper report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although our government did conduct such <span
class="quote">'experiments'</span> on unwitting populations, I did not
say that they were conducted <span class="quote">"openly,"</span> nor
that they were certainly conducted on homosexuals, drug addicts, or
Blacks, which I suspect, however. [82]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another article in the <span class="quote">"Amsterdam News"</span>
in January 1986, he revived his theory of a chemical agent causing AIDS
and suggested that The possibility that <span class="quote">"religious
terrorists"</span> or others with <span class="quote">"gay dust"</span>
wanted to kill not only homosexuals, but also drug addicts and African
Americans. He hypothetically asked whether AIDS in Africa could be the
result of the activities of <span class="quote">"American government
agencies"</span> seeking to effect a change of leadership there.[83]</p>
<p>The question arises: Did Lehrman work for the KGB? There is no
evidence of any knowing or willing activity on behalf of the KGB.
Nevertheless, there were indications of possible indirect influence by
Moscow on him. In his letter to the editor of the <span
class="quote">"Amsterdam News,"</span> Lehrman substantiated his claim
of possible CIA involvement in the spread of AIDS by pointing to an
issue of the Washington magazine <span class="quote">"Covert Action
Information Bulletin"</span> (CAIB) from the summer of 1982
(No. 17).[84]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In a follow-up article to Zapevalov's contribution, the <span
class="quote">"Literaturnaya Gazeta"</span> on May 17, 1986, entitled
<span class="quote">"AIDS: More Questions Than Answers,"</span> quoted
Lehrman as an American expert who confirmed the theory of the artificial
origin of AIDS. He claimed, the paper continued, that AIDS victims <span
class="quote">"could in some cases be the targets of premeditated
murder"</span> and named the possible perpetrator - the CIA.[86]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The AIDS-themed issue of CAIB featured two articles about the AIDS
bioweapon theory by Robert Lederer, who was a member of the editorial
board of CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the same and the following issue of CAIB, there was a longer
article on AIDS by journalist and editorial board member Robert Lederer,
who presented several <span class="quote">"alternative theories"</span>
on the origin of the HIV virus.[93] He wrote not only about the
possibility of an artificial origin at Fort Detrick based on the
theories of Jakob Segal,[94] but also about other possible origins in
connection with the American government's alleged chemical and
biological warfare plans.</p>

<p>The KGB explained to the Bulgarian comrades that since 1985 it had
<span class="quote">"carried out a series of activities"</span> on this
topic together <span class="quote">"with the German [...]
colleagues."</span>[109] The HV A had been commissioned by the KGB to
make its own <span class="quote">"scientific"</span> contribution to the
campaign.[110] The organizational work was undertaken by Section 1 of
the HV A, Department X (HV A/X/1), which was responsible for active
measures intended to provoke or intensify differences between the USA
and its NATO allies (OVO <span class="quote">"Axis"</span>, XV 173/72),
promote disarmament and the peace movement in the West (OVO <span
class="quote">"Mars"</span>, XV 1971/75), and mobilize states in the
Third World against the USA (OVO <span class="quote">"Forward"</span>,
XV 3741/73).[111] Although the HV A had already begun its work in 1985,
according to the KGB, Ingo Dams of the HV A/X/1 only initiated a
corresponding object operation (OVO) <span class="quote">"Denver"</span>
on July 17, 1986.[112]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At a meeting with his Bulgarian colleagues in September 1986, the
deputy head of HV A/X, Wolfgang Mutz, claimed that <span
class="quote">"Denver"</span> constituted a <span
class="quote">"significant part of the AM of the department [HV
A/X]."</span>[114] The study mentioned - <span class="quote">"a major
study with scientific value,"</span> according to Mutz - was already
finished.[115] It proves, according to Mutz, that <span
class="quote">"AIDS is a result of a biological weapon of the
USA"</span> and that it <span class="quote">"was and is being used by
them [i.e., the HV A] in various AMs around the world."</span>
Furthermore, the Americans wanted <span class="quote">"a copy from the
author."</span>[116] The study described by Mutz as part of the <span
class="quote">"Denver"</span> process could only refer to the manuscript
<span class="quote">"AIDS - Nature and Origin"</span>[117] by Professor
emeritus Jakob Segal, his wife Lilli, and chemist Ronald Dehmlow. The
brief description of the content fits exactly with Segal's study. It was
translated into English. The study (<span class="quote">"AIDS - Its
Nature and Origin"</span>)[118] had already been distributed during the
summit of the Non-Aligned States in Harare in September 1986 as part of
a brochure entitled <span class="quote">"AIDS USA-home made evil, NOT
imported from AFRICA."</span>[119] A week before Mutz's meeting with the
Bulgarians, a diplomat from the US Embassy in East Berlin had asked the
Segals for a copy of their study.[120] This study and the Segals'
further work on AIDS were discussed by the KGB and the HV A during their
exchange with their Bulgarian colleagues as part of the OVO <span
class="quote">"Denver."</span></p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The MfS was able to learn a lot about Segal's research from <span
class="quote">"Nils"</span>, as he was the graduate chemist Ronald
Dehmlow, the aforementioned co-author of Segal's thesis. Dehmlow had
known Jakob Segal since 1978. As a student at Humboldt University, he
began researching ultraviolet irradiation (UVB) and oxygen therapy (HOT)
with Segal.[188] He continued this joint research, now also on AIDS, at
the People's Police Hospital (KHdVP) in Berlin. Dehmlow had been known
to the Stasi for some time. During his studies, from 1975 to February
1984, he was registered by HV A/XI/6 as IM <span
class="quote">"Niels"</span>.[189] Shortly after his appointment to the
KHdVP, he was contacted by the staff of HA VII/7[190] and from December
1984 as IM candidate <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> (now without the
<span class="quote">"e"</span>)[191] and from June 1986 as IMS <span
class="quote">"Nils"</span> (Reg. No. XV 2987/86)[192]. Although the
officers of HA VII/7 <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> were primarily
responsible for securing their area of responsibility - i.e. the
government hospital - to spy on his colleagues,[193] they repeatedly
received reports and documents from Dehmlow about the Segals' AIDS
research, even though they had absolutely no interest in it.[194] As he
himself recalls, Dehmlow met with Jakob Segal every one to two weeks to
discuss the Segals' research on AIDS. Because of these regular
conversations and his translation assistance for the English version of
the study, Jakob Segal would have named him as a co-author of the
study.[195]</p>
<p>The purpose of Segal's AIDS research was not purely scientific from
the outset. As mentioned above, Jakob Segal did not believe in a natural
science detached from communist ideology. In a conversation with Dehmlow
and his superior, the Medical Director of the KHdVP, Reinhard Uhlig, in
June 1986, he admitted that his research was also intended to serve
<span class="quote">"propaganda purposes."</span> Such a use was in
keeping with his then-current contact with Axen, who was responsible for
foreign propaganda. Segal agreed with Uhlig that Dehmlow's name should
not be mentioned in such propaganda cases.[196] In the version of his
study that appeared in the Harare brochure, Segal adhered to the
agreement. The only change to the text was the deletion of Dehmlow's
name; all that remained of him was a telltale comma after the names of
the two Segals.[197]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>On July 31, 1986, Dehmlow, as IMS <span class="quote">"Nils,"</span>
urgently reported to his commanding officer, Lt. Axel Theisinger, that
Segal had <span class="quote">"deconspired"</span> to him. In a
discussion with Dehmlow about his AIDS research, he had stated that
<span class="quote">"the comrades in security had advised him to do
so."</span> Until then, Segal had always referred to the <span
class="quote">"Party"</span> as his client. Theisinger continued: <span
class="quote">"The IMS [i.e., Dehmlow] recognized [...] that the professor
might have been in contact with the <span class="quote">'friends'</span>
[i.e., the KGB] or the MfS."</span>[202] Theisinger, for his part, knew
exactly for whom Segal was conducting his research at this time. He
noted that Segal <span class="quote">"had been positively registered for
the HV A and was conducting AIDS research on behalf of the Central
Committee of the SED, Comrade Axen, and the HV A and was undertaking
trips in this context to the NSW. The service unit that had positively
registered Segal was, however, the only one."</span>[203] not the HV
A/X, but Section 5 of Department XIII in the Science and Technology
Sector of the HV A (HV A/SWT/XIII/5).[204] The phrase <span
class="quote">"positively recorded"</span> was used in the MfS to
describe a person who worked for the MfS.[205]</p>
<p>For the HV A/X, Mutz informed his Bulgarian counterpart in September
1986 that the HV A/X was collaborating <span class="quote">"with the
operational department on the problem [AIDS]"</span> in the creation of
disinformation.[206] For espionage activities in the area of AIDS and
biotechnology or genetic engineering, the responsible <span
class="quote">"operational department"</span> was the department HV
A/SWT/XIII/5 under the leadership of Lutz Thielemann.[207] He was the
superior of Lieutenant Colonel Dieter van de Sand, for whom Jakob Segal
was registered. Lilli Segal was also registered by HV A/SWT/XIII/5.[208]
The <span class="quote">"security"</span> advice to Jakob Segal will
have been sent via the registering unit, HV A/SWT/XIII/5.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Although Jakob Segal demonstrably knew of the MfS's interest in his
research, the surviving files of the HV A in the BStU archives contain
no details about his positive registration by the HV A/SWT/XIII/5.
Because both Segals were registered by the HV A, there must also have
been index cards for them in the HV A index. However, the corresponding
files are missing from the BStU's <span class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span>
database.[227]</p>
<p>[227] If the Segals were registered as Soviet or French citizens, it
is possible that the CIA did not hand over the corresponding cards in
<span class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span> to the German government.
According to CIA guidelines, only copies of card indexes on German
individuals in the former HV A card index in the Rosenholz files were
handed over to the Federal Republic. See Müller-Enbergs: <span
class="quote">"Rosenholz"</span> (note 11), p. 52. It is also possible,
however, that the cards for the couple were removed from the card index
by the HV A earlier or destroyed. One can only speculate as to what
happened to the cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that an interview between Stefan Heym and Jakob Segal was
published in the West Berlin newspaper <span class="quote">"taz"</span>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MfAA), for its part, announced that
foreign journalists were not required to obtain permits to conduct
interviews with the Segals. The official reason: Both were retired
professors and therefore did not need to apply for a permit.[260]
However, for most ordinary pensioners in the GDR, such freedom of speech
did not apply to Western media. The SED (Social Democratic Party of
Germany) and the State Security Service (Stasi) evidently wanted to
support the international dissemination of Segal's thesis by all
means.</p>
<p>In private, however, the Segals not only complained about their <span
class="quote">"publication ban"</span> in the GDR.[261] They also
portrayed themselves as if they were on their own when it came to
potential publications of their thesis and journalistic activities in
Western countries. In April 1987, Lilli Segal even claimed that they had
to organize and finance their lecture tours to West Germany
themselves.</p>

<p>After the article in the <em>Sunday Express</em>, for example, the
Segals were contacted by the Indian journalist Kunhanandan Nair.[273]
Nair had been an accredited correspondent for the Indian newspapers
<em>Blitz</em> and <em>Patriot</em> in East Berlin for many years,[274]
which were known for publishing Soviet disinformation.[275] Nair was
also a fixture for HV A. In the run-up to the summit in Harare, HV A/X
had written a book that <span class="quote">"exposed"</span> and harshly
criticized the CIA's policies regarding the Non-Aligned Movement and the
Third World in general, using a mixture of facts and disinformation
theories from the KGB and the Eastern <span class="quote">"brother

an active measure, <span class="quote">"mirror"</span>[277] or <span

appeared in Blitz on July 2, 1987, under the title <span

Sunday Times without naming the author and was reprinted in the

<p>One gets the impression that Heym was only able to offer his
interview with Segal in the Federal Republic because HV A/SWT/XIII was
working behind the scenes. Heym was constantly monitored and frequently
hindered in his work as a writer by HA XX/9 of the MfS, which pursued
him in the Operational Procedure (OV) <span
class="quote">"Diversant."</span>[300] Without further explanation, HA
XX/9 could have prevented the publication of the interview in the West.
But Heym's contact with the Segals led to Tustanowski, the officer in HA
XX/9 responsible for the OV <span class="quote">"Diversant,"</span>
inquiring about HV A/SWT's jurisdiction over the Segals. On October 28,
1986, he met with van de Sand to learn more about the meetings between
the Segals and the Heyms. If van de Sand had not already made it clear
at that time, Colonel Jesse, Head of Department of HV A/SWT/XIII,
informed by November 12th at the latest that HV A had an <span
class="quote">"operational interest [...] in ensuring that Prof. Segal's
thesis that the AIDS virus is a product of American biological weapons
research is spreading in NSW."</span>[301]</p>
<p>In other words, HA XX/9 was to take no action to prevent the
publication of the Heym-Segal interview. Subsequently, HA XX informed
the Deputy Minister of State Security, Rudi Mittig, of HV A's <span
class="quote">"operational"</span> concern to have Heym's interview with
Segal published in the West.[302]</p>
<p>Because Heym hadn't managed to publish his interview with Segal even
after months, HV A/X provided some help behind the scenes. Joachim
Nölte, a major and officer on special assignment (OibE) of HV
A/X/4,[303] working under the alias of an employee in the press
department of the GDR Foreign Ministry, informed Arno Widmann of the
<span class="quote">"taz"</span> newspaper that Stefan Heym had a <span

contact in early 1987, after so many disappointments, must have been a

its entirety.</p>

the GDR from publishing criticisms of Segal's thesis. For this reason,
and because of the popularization of his thesis outside the GDR, Segal
can be considered a beneficiary of both the Stasi and the Central
Committee of the SED.</p>
<p>But the GDR's AIDS experts neither gave up their private criticism of
Segal nor their attempts to overturn the Central Committee's publication
ban. Sönnichsen, for example, explained to an MfS informant shortly
after Seidel's decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an undisputed fact that Professor Segal has backing; otherwise,
it would be impossible for him to operate unhindered in this way. He is
a Soviet citizen (with a passport), but has lived in the GDR for about
30 years and now travels around as a pensioner. Professor Sönnichsen's
opinion: Whoever backs him must discipline him.[348]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Ronald Dehmlow (who was the third author in the Segal report) was
commissioned by the Stasi to write a rebuttal to Erhard Geissler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The newspaper [<em>Neue Zeit</em>] became a platform for opponents of
Segal's thesis. One day after Segal's conversation with Schneidewind,
the newspaper quoted Geissler as saying that he had <span
class="quote">"vigorously"</span> rejected the claim that <span
class="quote">"the HIV virus, the AIDS pathogen, was created through
genetic manipulation."</span>[351] The HV A switched to defense. It
commissioned Dehmlow, alias <span class="quote">"Nils,"</span> via HA
VII/7, to prepare an article for the <span class="quote">"Neue
Zeit"</span> newspaper, which it described as a <span
class="quote">"counter-speech to Prof. Rosenthal."</span> should have
served. Dehmlow fulfilled the order in December 1987,[352] but the
article was apparently never published in the <span class="quote">"Neue
Zeit."</span>[353]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 352 is <span class="quote">"Oltn. Theisinger, Meeting
Report: IMS <span class="quote">'Nils,'</span> December 3, 1987; BStU,
MfS, AIM 4835/88, Vol. 2, p. 17 f."</span></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>While there is no documentary evidence for the years 1985 to 1986
that would prove that the MfS supported the Segals and their research
and lecture activities, the situation is different for the period after
1987.</p>
<p>The first evidence of such assistance dates back to a meeting between
Dehmlow (IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span>) and his commanding
officer in HA VII/7, Theisinger, and with Thielemann from HV A/
SWT/XIII/5 on 27 August 1987. During this meeting, Thielemann explicitly
commissioned Dehmlow to provide <span class="quote">"professional and
scientific support to Prof. Segal."</span> Furthermore, Thielemann
tasked <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> with developing <span
class="quote">"scientifically sound counterarguments against the common
theory"</span> of the artificial production of the AIDS pathogen through
genetic engineering and the <span class="quote">"checking of
Prof. Segal's environment for possible enemy attacks as well as for
possible persons,[359] which support the above theory"</span>.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Thielemann even offered Dehmlow a new position at an
institute of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Buch. The position would
have involved the IM being taken over by HV A/SWT/XIII/5. However,
Dehmlow, supported by Theisinger, declined.[360] The job offer was
presumably the HV A/SWT/XIII/5's reaction to Dehmlow's growing
professional problems. His position at the People's Police Hospital
became increasingly difficult as a result of the harsh criticism of
Segal's thesis at the colloquium at the Charité in November 1986.[361]
One of Dehmlow's superiors had decided after the colloquium that Dehmlow
should generally cease his research on <span class="quote">"all sorts of
unimportant problems, such as AIDS, UVB, etc."</span> at the KHdVP and
his collaboration <span class="quote">"with the senile old Professor
Segal."</span>[362] The superior wanted Dehmlow's labor to be used for
his own research project.[363] He even claimed to Dehmlow that <span
class="quote">"the Enlightenment"</span> - i.e., the HV A - had
instructed him <span class="quote">"to slow down Segal and especially me
[Dehmlow], we had already caused enough damage - through our activities
we had exposed a source of <span class="quote">'A'</span> who was very
close to the situation."</span>[364] Dehmlow then replied to his
superior that <span class="quote">"Prof. Segal's activities are covered
by Comrade Axen at home and abroad."</span>[365]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>From April 1988, Dehmlow was able to devote himself fully to Segal's
research and other assignments from HV A/SWT/XIII/5. He became the head
of a research center for medical biophysical chemistry, which
corresponded exactly to his ideas. He reported to the GDR Deputy
Minister of Health, Ulrich Schneidewind. Thielemann indicated to
Theisinger that he had helped to create the position.[378] When Dehmlow
took up his new position, Thielemann officially took over the file on
IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span> from Theisinger and handed it over
to van de Sand shortly thereafter.[379] Jakob Segal was employed under
Dehmlow as the <span class="quote">"scientific director"</span> of the
research center, and his wife Lilli as a <span
class="quote">"documentation consultant."</span>[380] Jakob Segal wrote
in May 1988 to an acquaintance: <span class="quote">"We were promised
generous funding for staff, equipment, and devices, and we began very
slowly and carefully to look for young, interested people."</span>[381]
According to Lilli Segal in an interview with <span
class="quote">"taz,"</span> the new research center would conduct <span
class="quote">"fundamental AIDS research."</span>[382] The new
arrangement corresponded to Dehmlow's plan.[383] It made van de Sand's
work easier because he knew that Jakob Segal, whom he had <span
class="quote">"positively identified,"</span> Lilli Segal, and the IM
<span class="quote">"Nils,"</span> whom he had taken over, were working
in the same environment. He could more easily pass on information to
them and more easily collect information from and about them.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Following Zapevalov's article, which allegedly suggested a high
number of AIDS-infected people among US military personnel,[412] the
Literaturnaya Gazeta delivered further <span class="quote">"black
propaganda."</span> In April 1986, it reported on an alleged decision by
the Honduran parliament to relocate American military bases to isolated
areas so that soldiers would not spread the virus among the local
population.[413] In May 1986, it reported on alleged concerns in other
countries that <span class="quote">"the USA had not taken effective
steps to initiate quarantine measures against the spread of AIDS outside
the USA."</span> In this context, it pointed to public appeals in Japan,
where ships of the American fleet were to be kept away from Japanese
ports for fear of infection with the AIDS pathogen.[414] The KGB
considered it a success that there was a large demonstration in 1988
calling for the closure of American bases in Seoul because of the
alleged threat of AIDS.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The propaganda in the Soviet press about the alleged American origin
of AIDS was stopped in September 1988, despite the objections of the
Soviet press agencies TASS and Novosti (especially Falin).[421,422]
Around this time, according to his own account, Jakob Segal was invited
to a meeting by the Soviet embassy in East Berlin. The cultural attaché
apologized to him that his thesis would no longer be published in the
USSR <span class="quote">"alongside the classical theories."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In September 1988, Mutz and Pfeifer personally handed over the next,
revised version of Segal's study from the left-wing Munich journal <span
class="quote">"Streitbarer Materialismus"</span>[428] to their Bulgarian
colleagues in Sofia for further use in active measures. The article,
according to the Stasi officers, was a <span class="quote">"revised
version of the book [sic] by [the] Prof. [redacted] [...], in which he
considered the latest results of .investigations and argued against all
opponents."</span> The HV A/X assessed the article as <span
class="quote">"good material, relatively peaceful, but
convincing."</span>[429] The <span class="quote">"German
comrades"</span> confidently declared: <span class="quote">"Regardless
of their angry reaction, the Americans are unable to refute Professor
[redacted]'s hypothesis regarding the origin of the AIDS
virus."</span>[430]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wolfgang Mutz was the deputy head of HV A/X, and Hans Pfeiffer was
the deputy head of HV A/X/1, which was <span class="quote">"responsible
for active measures intended to provoke or intensify differences between
the USA and its NATO allies"</span>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>During their visit to Bulgaria a year earlier, Mutz and Pfeifer had
already spoken of the film project as part of the <span
class="quote">"De-trick"</span> operation. It was said at the time that
HV A/X had requested <span class="quote">"the production of a
film."</span>[449] The film was <span class="quote">"a matter for their
operational channel (illegal)."</span> They continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The film that the comrades in West Germany are preparing about the
AIDS problem will be a work of their operative channel (illegally). This
channel has already signed a contract with West German television. They
are taking every measure to ensure that no one notices that the GDR has
any connection to the film, even though they have to provide financial
support. The interview that Prof. Segal's presentation in October of
this year is intended to be the culmination of this effort. [...] It will
be a documentary in the style of English investigative crime films. The
arguments will be presented objectively, with one exception: It will
show that the Americans are spreading disinformation about AIDS and that
they are abusing technological interventions.[450]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal promoted false treatments for AIDS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal even put forward several suggestions for alternative therapies.
In a 1990 article co-authored with his old research colleague Dehmlow,
he cautiously suggested that ultraviolet radiation (UVB) could <span
class="quote">"delay or prevent the infection of new cells and the
development of disease,"</span> even in the case of HIV infection.[508]
Segal repeated this <span class="quote">"therapeutic approach"</span> in
his own book <span class="quote">"AIDS: Cell Physiology, Pathology and
Therapy"</span> in 1992.[509] One such possibility had already been
mentioned by Dehmlow in 1987 - as IMS <span class="quote">"Nils"</span>
in a report for the Stasi on UVB and oxygen therapy. He had also pointed
out the economic advantages of the potential, successful treatment of
AIDS and other diseases with UVB therapy. The GDR would have been able
to carry out such a therapy without expensive imports gfrom Western
countries.[510] Segal had already wanted to treat HIV-infected patients
with UVB during the GDR era, but this was rejected by Seidel.[511]</p>
<p>After the end of the GDR, Dehmlow increasingly specialized in such
alternative therapies and even became president of the Society for Ozone
and Oxygen Applications in Berlin.[512] However, UVB and HOT found no
support in the Joint Federal Committee of Physicians and Health
Insurance Funds, which generally recognized <span class="quote">"no
reliable evidence for the benefit and medical necessity"</span> of their
use, without even mentioning AIDS.[513]</p>
<p>Segal saw other possibilities for early AIDS therapy in traditional
and natural remedies from Africa and Asia. Regarding the negative
results of tests with African medicinal plants against HIV infections in
the USA, he wrote - completely illogically and unscientifically: <span
class="quote">"If in America all patients in the late stages [of AIDS]
died, it was to be assumed that in Africa patients in earlier stages
survived to a high degree when treated with native medicinal
plants."</span> Good news also came from China: "And if in May 1995
Chinese doctors reported cures for AIDS with a natural remedy, this is
entirely in line with our expectations.[514]</p>
<p>But the <span class="quote">"new approach"</span> to AIDS therapy, on
which Segal particularly focused, looked something else entirely:
regular administration of small doses of aspirin in the early stages of
HIV infection.[515] In 1992, he explained: <span class="quote">"Aspirin
should [...] effectively inhibit HIV proliferation."</span>[516] He asked
hypothetically why doctors were not using aspirin to treat AIDS. His
answer was: <span class="quote">"Imagine: If the patient can now be
cured without having to go to the hospital with two aspirin tablets
daily, i.e., with pennies, then it is obvious that the doctors don't
like me, the pharmaceutical industry, and the USA don't like me
either."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Particularly traumatic for the proponents of Segal's thesis and
characteristic of its classification as a conspiracy theory was the fact
that the Segals could not provide any empirical evidence to support
their to prove the famous <span class="quote">"chain of
evidence."</span> For example, none of the US prisoners allegedly used
as guinea pigs for the Fort Detrick virus could ever be identified.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Ljungqvist was not the only one who continued to propagate Segal's
thesis alongside alternative therapies for AIDS in the 2000s. The
intellectual heir of Segal's thesis and its early therapy did the same:
its co-author Christoph Klug, a member of the Marxist-Leninist Party of
Germany (MLPD) and director of the MLPD-affiliated publishing house
<span class="quote">"Neuer Weg"</span> in Essen,[544] which published
the Segals' last books in the 1990s. The left-wing extremist[545] MLPD
used the Segals' conspiracy theory to promote, among other things, its
goal of <span class="quote">"an international socialist
revolution."</span>[546] Klug and the MLPD-affiliated support group
<span class="quote">"Neue Wege in der HIV-Therapie"</span> (FNW)
propagated Segal's thesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A new reason for the renewed publicity controversy surrounding
Segal's thesis was aroused. The Duisburg hip-hop duo <span
class="quote">"Die Bandbreite"</span> was disinvited from the
Christopher Street Day (CSD) in Duisburg because they wanted to rap
their new song about AIDS. The lyrics reflected Segal's thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Do you believe the crap about the monkeys, the nasty green
monkeys?<br> The animals that their Zairian hunters first infected,<br>
SIV mutates, and the blacks bring it across the pond,<br> so that HIV 81
then reaches the USA via Haiti.<br> But it can't be that easy, as a
mistake can creep in,<br> because SIV and HIV have virtually no
similarities.</p>
<p>Doctor MacAthur [sic] in 69 asked the House of Representatives for
money<br> because the country needed a biological weapon for its
military.<br> And so it happened, the money went out and then Robert
Gallo showed up.<br> They say he discovered AIDS. False! The man built
AIDS. [...]<br> AIDS has the same morphology as the Visna virus, which
affects sheep,<br> the same molecular weight, and sixty percent genome
identical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>During his research, journalist Philipp Wahl learned that the <span
class="quote">"pseudo- scientific song"</span> had been commissioned by
the FNW.[587] The chairman of the FNW, Detlef Rohm, had given the duo
the paid commission and presented the song, including the corresponding
video on YouTube, at the very last general meeting of the association in
April 2012.[588] The last verse of the song makes the sponsorship
clear:</p>
<p>Wojnarowicz calls for the implementation of the association's <span
class="quote">"immediate program,"</span> including early treatment with
aspirin.[589]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 587 referred to an article titled in German <span
class="quote">"Wide-ranging AIDS and Nazi songs divide homosexuals ahead
of Pride"</span>.

<p>FNW was Klug's group <span class="quote">"Förderverein »Neue Wege in

<span class="quote">'New Approaches in HIV Therapy'</span>"</span>).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the writings of the Segals, Klugs, the FNW, and the
MLPD, including conspiracy theories and proposals for early AIDS
treatment, do not appear to have had the destructive consequences of the
activities of Duesberg and other AIDS deniers. The latter significantly
influenced Mbeki's policies. In contrast to Duesberg, the Segals were
always aware of the dangers of HIV and therefore supported <span
class="quote">"safe sex."</span>[617] During a lecture tour through
South Africa, Klug, as a member of the MLPD, together with its sister
party, the Communist Party of South Africa Marxist-Leninist (CPSA-ML),
took a stand against Mbeki's AIDS policy. As part of their <span
class="quote">"militant alliance"</span> for the introduction of Klug's
emergency program against AIDS in South Africa, they called for early
treatment with aspirin and the development of a p24-based vaccine, as
well as the immediate introduction of ARVs without profit for the
pharmaceutical industry. Klug and the FNW reject Duesberg's AIDS denial
as unscientific and false.[619]</p>

<a href=#Robert_Strecker_on_Visna_recombination id=Robert_Strecker_on_Visna_recombination>Robert
Strecker on Visna recombination</a>
</h2>
<p>In the Strecker Memorandum video, Robert Strecker said:
[<a href=https://rapeutation.com/streckermemoscreenplay.pdf>https://rapeutation.com/streckermemoscreenplay.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you say, well, we look at the AIDS virus, and we say, <span
class="quote">"Well, it's only 50% identical to visna, and it's only 50%
identical to bovine leukemia."</span> And they say, <span
class="quote">"That's distally related."</span> It's like saying I'm
distally related to my mother or my father because I only contain 50% of
their genes. Of course that's nonsense! The fact is that containing 50%
of the genes of the virus, you could be the direct descendant of the
parents. It's the same as each of us. Each of us is a direct descendant
of our parents and we contain 50% of our mother's genes, and 50% of our
father's genes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However that was a poor analogy, because if in the 1980s HIV-1
would've been a recent recombinant of Visna and BLV, then early
sequences of HIV-1 would have some segments that would be close to 100%
identical to Visna and other segments that would be close to 100%
identical to BLV.</p>
<p>In the next plot I compared an early French HIV sequence from 1984
against the reference genomes of Visna and BLV. You can see that HIV is
has about 40-60% similarity to Visna and BLV throughout the genome. The
similarity would be even lower if I didn't ignore positions with
gaps:</p>

<p>In the book <em>Emerging Viruses</em>, Len Horowitz reported on the
following conversation he had with Robert Strecker (where the ellipses
and brackets are part of the original text):
[<a href=https://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=194&t=2016>https://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=194&amp;t=2016</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEN: OK. Now let's get a little bit more specific about the virus
itself. With regard to the AIDS virus, had it been specifically
manufactured, what might have been the first steps? What do you think
the researchers began with?</p>
<p>ROBERT: I think they began with bovine visna virus, which they knew
was a T-cell destroyer. And they made that by crossing bovine and visna
[viruses] in cattle. ...</p>
<p>Visna is the virus in sheep. Its characteristic is a destroyer, and
they wanted a T-cell destroyer. So they took a T-cell attacker-the
bovine leukemia virus and crossed it with a visna to make a T-cell
destroyer, which is exactly what they got.</p>
<p>But then all they had was a T-cell destroyer in cattle which wasn't
very good for humans. So then they grew it in human tissue, and when you
do that it adapts to human beings (see fig. 7.1). And there are a host
of ways to get these things to grow in tissue even if the receptors
won't take [the virus]. ...</p>
<p>LEN: They could have delivered the viral RNA a number of ways.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yes. One of the ways is by pseudovirus formation. ...
Pseudovirus formation is where you put in a simultaneous mixture of
cells and viruses, and what happens is, for instance, if you put bovine
and visna viruses in with herpes virus; in the packaging process, you'll
get BVV genome inside a herpes coat and visa versa.</p>
<p>So then you separate out all the herpes ones, and it just infects any
cells which are sensitive to herpes. And you can artificially introduce
BVV into a herpes-sensitive cell, because it has BVV on the inside and
herpes on the outside.</p>
<p>LEN: I remember reading through studies about that technique being
used.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah. Another way is you treat 'em with heat, and they open
up. Or you can use some detergents that will open them up, or there's a
host of different things; even some viruses will tend to open them up.
It makes the cells permeable even though they normally wouldn't be, so
you can introduce the one you want to get in even though there's no real
receptor for it.</p>
<p>LEN: OK. So it could've been bovine visna virus, BVV, but also there
was some speculation it could have been scrapie, another sheep virus,
right?</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah, well. ... Scrapie's a little bit different than visna,
but basically I don't think scrapie's a retrovirus. It's like it, but
it's not the culprit.</p>
<p>LEN: During our first conversation, you also mentioned, like other
researchers, you could actually take a look at the AIDS virus, and it
looks like it's been spliced in particular regions.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Oh yes. Actually, looking at it was one of the first things
that told us what it was because BVV and AIDS, of course, look
identical, and there weren't that many <span
class="quote">'D-type'</span> retroviruses. There were only a few.</p>
<p>The <span class="quote">'D-type'</span> are cylindrical-shaped
retroviruses which of course BVV and AIDS are identical. Besides the
fact that they were both magnesium dependent and were T-cell attackers
that would produce syncytium and could wipe out cells.</p>
<p>And then what you do is look at the genome. Actually, a paper by
Gallo published in <span class="quote">'Science'</span> I think about
'83, or '86, said he took the restriction endonucleases [scissor-like
enzymes] and treated the virus, and showed that when the virus falls
apart, that where it falls apart are exactly at the gene lines.</p>
<p>In other words, it manages to fall apart just at the places where
they could have constructed it.</p>
<p>LEN: Is that right? Just where the foreign pieces might have come
together?</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yes, it falls apart in ten or twelve places... because those
endonucleases cut at specific points.</p>
<p>But, what's interesting is ... if it occurred spontaneously [in
nature], why would it fall apart exactly where the genes occurred - the
gag, pol, envelope, the tat genes? [30] Everything sort of cuts apart
just the way you would put it together if you were constructing it. ...
[This] we thought [was] the strongest piece of evidence that would have
said they actually put it together entirely in a lab.</p>
<p>LEN: And how might they have done that then? Let's say they started
with BVV.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Well, in this case if you start with BVV, you just manipulate
it to grow it in human tissue to adapt it to humans.</p>
<p>If you started with BLV and visna, you would ... take the viruses, cut
them up [with enzymes], then chromatograph them so that they're
homologous. That is, the ten different parts [separate], then you take
each different part that you want uniquely and put it together with
other parts and zip' em up.</p>
<p>LEN: And how do they <span class="quote">'zip 'em up'</span> or
combine them?</p>
<p>ROBERT: They have enzymes that sew them back up just like they've got
ones which cut' em apart. These are repair enzymes.</p>
<p>LEN: Then they separate those particular viruses, and they put them
into cells?</p>
<p>ROBERT: They put them into serum ... [add] your enzymes and [other]
parts and wait for awhile. And then throw [everything] ... into a culture
and see what happens."</p>
<p>[I was still a bit fuzzy.]</p>
<p>ROBERT: But you see that's work. You don't have to do that. Nature
does it all for you. All you do is take a cow and simultaneously inject
bovine in one hip and visna in the other, and the cow is your mixer. And
it will do it for you automatically. Because what happens is the viruses
are so unstable that they will recombine and produce every
thermodynamically stable recombinant possible.</p>
<p>LEN: Interesting. It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>ROBERT: Yeah. You see that's why everybody says, <span
class="quote">"We didn't make these viruses! We didn't have the
techniques."</span></p>
<p>LEN: That's nonsense.</p>

<p>So I guess if you want to create the ultimate killer virus, the only
thing you need to do is inject one virus in one hip of a cow and another
virus in another hip of the cow, and then the cow will automatically mix
together a deadly bioweapon for you.</p>

<p>The first point by ChatGPT was partially wrong, because <span
class="quote">"bovine visna virus"</span> was an early name for the
bovine lentivirus BIV (bovine immunodeficiency virus).
[<a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688908200634>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688908200634</a>]
If positions with gaps are ignored, the reference genome of BIV has
about 50% nucleotide similarity to the reference genome of Visna:</p>

<p>But still, you cannot just magically create BIV out of Visna by
infecting cows with Visna and with another virus that is not even a
lentivirus.</p>
<p>Horowitz also wrote that Strecker told him about Segal: <span
class="quote">"He was writing the same stuff, but again, he thought that
the virus was constructed from HTLV-I and visna. And that's correct
except he didn't go far enough because really HTLV-I is just bovine
leukemia virus in man."</span>

<p>HTLV-I and BLV are both deltaretroviruses, but their reference

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly all have the same history as the Sovereign Order up to the
1798 exile from Malta. In fact, five of them and the Sovereign Order
formally recognize each other.</p>
<p>Subsequent histories vary considerably.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sovereign Order has a strong claim to being the original
organisation, both through the name and the post diaspora possession of
the relics.</li>
<li>We have a Grant of Arms by Letters Patent issued to us by the
Governor General of Canada by virtue of the authority vested with him
from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada.</li>
<li>Our King Peter II Constitution was granted by Royalty, a requirement
for chivalric Orders.</li>
<li>We are ecumenical and have been, in practical terms, since our
arrival in Russia.</li>
<li>We are not related to any specific church.</li>
<li>We put great emphasis on helping <span class="quote">"the sick and
the poor"</span> of all religions as has been the tradition and practice
of the Sovereign Order from times prior to its formal recognition by the
Pope in 1113.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been working to bring together as many of the Orders that
share our history as possible. The Reunification of the Sovereign Order
of the Hospital Order of St John of Jerusalem (Continental Europe) with
the Sovereign Order of St John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitaller
(Americas and UK) in 2010 is a good example. At any given time there are
on-going discussions with other groups.</p>
