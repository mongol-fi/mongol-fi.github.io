<h2>
<a href=#Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Nick
the Spacecat's Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick the Spacecat claims that HIV is the product of recombination
between SIV and the Visna-maedi virus.</p>
<p>He said <span class="quote">"I've seen there are 12 genes in HIV from
Visna"</span>, even though HIV doesn't even have 12 genes:
[<a href=https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801>https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Nick wasn't able to answer which part of the genome of HIV was taken
from HIV, but he just said that Gallo was <span class="quote">"sizing up
Visna as a dance partner for SIVs"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-4.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Here I again showed him similarity plots which showed why his Visna
recombination theory didn't make sense:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-1.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>A month later Nick again posted the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, so I pointed out to him again that the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium formation:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>He eventually blocked me because of these tweets:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-5.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>In March 2025 Nick hosted a video roundtable, which featured
presentations by himself, Adam Finnegan, Charles Rixey, and Aaron
Baalbergen. During his own presentation, Nick showed the graphic below
where he claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Visna and SIV, and he
said: <span class="quote">"And then they'd get a whole brady bunch of
different chimeras or hybrids. This is my very crude scientific
rendering of that process building HIV - and today's presentation is not
about the details of this - but <span class="quote">'viral
fusion'</span> are the keywords that you want to use if you'd like to
search more about this process."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974>https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-1.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>Then he showed a screenshot of the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, and he said <span class="quote">"Here, in my opinion, is
the final step that created HIV, and that would be fusing this, a sheep
virus with that STLV we mentioned before."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-2.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>At that point I had already told him multiple times that the paper
had nothing to do with the genomic recombination of Visna and HIV, and
the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium
formation and not recombination. So I told him on Kevin McCairn's
Discord that he seems to be deliberately producing disinformation,
because he should've realized himself that the paper had nothing to do
with his Visna recombination theory. And I posted even more evidence on
the Discord that showed why his theory didn't make sense.</p>
<p>However even after that Nick has kept posting screenshots of the
paper on Twitter:

<h2>
<a href=#Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Origin
of Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick's Visna recombination theory had earlier been presented by his
mentor Alan Cantwell. Cantwell in turn appears to have copied the theory
from Robert Strecker, who had presented it by March 1986 or earlier. The
Visna theory had also been presented by John Seale by December 1985 or
earlier, and by Jakob Segal by May 1986 or earlier. However I'm not sure
if Strecker, Segal, or Seale came up with the theory first.</p>
<p>Alan Cantwell copied his theory that cancer was caused by bacteria
from the alternative health practicioner Virginia Livingston-Wheeler. In
his book <em>AIDS and the Doctors of Death</em>, Alan Cantwell wrote:
<span class="quote">"I remember distinctly the early morning phone call
from Dr. Virginia Livingston-Wheeler that started it all in August
1986."</span> And he wrote she invited him to a meeting held by Robert
Strecker, who <span class="quote">"carefully explained the unique
molecular composition of the AIDS virus, emphasizing how it greatly
resembles a virus in sheep called <span class="quote">'visna
virus.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>Cantwell also wrote that Strecker had presented the Visna theory in a
report dated March 1986: <span class="quote">"Strecker began to pass out
copies of a report entitled <span class="quote">'This is a Bio-Attack
Alert.'</span> The manuscript was dated March 28, 1986, and was written
by the Strecker brothers. The report contained detailed information on
their theory, and provided documented evidence to show that the AIDS
epidemic was biological warfare."</span> In the report Strecker wrote:
<span class="quote">"The AIDS virus is Bovine Visna Virus (BVV) in man
with a transacting transcriptional regulator gene inherited from Bovine
Leukemia Virus"</span>.
[<a href=https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/>https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/</a>]</p>
<p>In December 1985 the Los Angeles Times published an interview of John
Seale, which said: <span class="quote">"Seale, who is in private
practice and specializes in urinary and venereal diseases, said the AIDS
virus, which attacks the body's immune system, has one gene extra over
the Visna virus. [...] <span class="quote">'Inserting an extra gene into a
virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engineering,'</span>
Seale said."</span>

<p>In December 1985 the British communist newspaper <em>Morning
Star</em> also reported on statements by Seale. In the paper <span
class="quote">"Disinformation squared: Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick
myth a Stasi success?"</span>, Erhard Geissler and Robert Hunt Sprinkle
wrote:
[<a href=https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/disinformation-squared-was-the-hivfromfortdetrick-myth-a-stasi-success/8CFEA2F6B8FA780208DFAC39DC57A03E>https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/disinformation-squared-was-the-hivfromfortdetrick-myth-a-stasi-success/8CFEA2F6B8FA780208DFAC39DC57A03E</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 20 December 1985, nine days after <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
published its Drozdov interview, London's <em>Morning Star</em>, a
communist newspaper, reported that the New Zealand AIDS Foundation had
received a letter with claims similar to Professor Drozdov's. John Seale
had been reconsidering his presumption that the origin of HIV had been
natural. He now said that <span class="quote">"the AIDS virus may have
been manufactured in laboratories as a slow but deadly biological
warfare weapon."</span> He went on to say that <span
class="quote">"there was <span class="quote">'circumstantial
evidence'</span> to back the belief that the AIDS virus was genetically
engineered in a laboratory."</span>[56]</p>
<p>On 26 December 1985, Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">"World
Service,"</span> broadcasting in English, presented Seale's ominous new
inference as a conclusion.[57]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same paper also said that Jakob Segal had presented the Visna
theory by May 1986: <span class="quote">"Five months after his mention
on Moscow Radio, Seale was contacted by an ambitious new ally soon to
eclipse all earlier theorists. In a letter dated 29 May 1986, Jakob
Segal, a Soviet citizen long retired from a professorship of biology in
East Germany, wrote to suggest that <span class="quote">'the AIDS virus
is a chimera.'</span> By this he meant a recombinant of the human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and the Maedi-Visna
virus"</span>.</p>
<p>HTLV-I is not even a lentivirus like HIV and Visna. Robert Strecker
claimed that HIV was a recombinant of bovine leukemia virus and Visna,
even though BLV is not a lentivirus. There is no part of the genome of
HIV that is anywhere near similar to HTLV-I or BLV.</p>
<p>In the 1986 report, Jakob Segal claimed that the <span
class="quote">"The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from
HTLV-I, its larger part with the 3' end from Visna virus"</span>:
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna>https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hybridisation between Visna end LAV/HTL7-III takes an entirely
different course (fig.2c). The ranges of hybridisation are evenly
distributed over the entire lenght [sic] of the genomes, making up
altogether 35 per cent of their lenght [sic].</p>
<p>To investigate in how far coincidental conformities can simulat [sic]
hybridisation, the LAV/HTLV-III strand was implanted in a reversed
direction in a further experiment (fig.2d). In that case there is no
hybridisation at any point, which indicates that the relations
demonstrated in fig.2c are not conditioned by coincidence.</p>
<p>It is therefore clearly shown that in the main part of their genomes
Visna and LAV/HTLV-III are largely in conformity. The differences may
well lie in the magnitude of mutations. On the other hand in this part
of the genome LAV/HTLV-III fundamentally differs from the genome of
HTLV-I. It is therefore completely excluded that the HTLV-I should of
itself have changed, by an unfortunate combination of mutations, into
the AIDS virus LAV/HTLV-III.</p>
<p>One might well be tempted to reverse Gallo's original hypothesis and
to assume, that the Visna virus spontaneously changed into the AIDS
virus. Yet, so far no scientist has gone as far as that conclusion - for
a very good reason. By a coincidence - or a series of coincidences - a
genome part of 275 nucleotides from the Visna virus would have had to
change so greatly, that at least 50 per cent of them fitted to the
corresponding section of the HTLV-I genome, since it is common to the
HTLV-I and the HTLV-III, as shown above. The probability that this might
happen is 1:6 x 10⁸². Such an event is therefore absolutely impossible,
and corresponding results will also be obtained, if, instead of
hybridising the genomes, their nucleotide sequences are compared with
oneanother [sic]. There could not have been a coincidental, spontaneous
transition from Visna to AIDS virus.</p>
<p>The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from HTLV-I, its larger
part with the 3'end fon Visna virus. The whole thing is a <span
class="quote">"chimera"</span>, a system, of two components of different
origin, artificially by nature and only brought by the skills of genetic
engineering.</p>
<p>Recently the nucleotide chain of the Visna virus has been sequenced
(Sonigo et al. (21)). On that basis Stephens et al. (22) drew up a
phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses. According to this, the
LAV/HTLV-III are very closely related. A branch far remote from them
comprises HTLV-I, HTLV-II, BLV (bovine leukemia virus) and other animal
viruses. The marked [two words not visible] between HTLV-I and
LAV/HTLV-III is is also demonstrated by the phylogenetic trees drawn up
independently by Chiu et al. (23), Wayne-Hobson et al. (14), Gonda et
al. (24) and Watanabe et al. (25) (fig.4). A spontaneous transition from
the sub-family HTLV-I to the sub-family HTLV-III/Visna must be
completely excluded biologically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 1986, the <em>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</em>
published a letter which said:
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, The excellent editorial on the AIDS virus infection by John
Seale (August 1985 JRSM, pp 613-15) has stimulated a very productive
discussion. However, I would like to draw your attention to a commentary
on this paper on Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">'World
Service'</span> in English on 26 December 1985, 21.00 GMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifying the origin of a disease makes the search for a remedy
easier. Following this rule, Dr John Seale of Britain has concluded that
the AIDS virus has been artificially created and its appearance is
possibly the result of a human error. This conclusion supports the view
that the AIDS epidemic has been caused by experiments with humans
carried out in the USA as part of the development of new biological
weapons.</p>
<p>Dr Seale claims in his report that, from the viewpoint of genetic
engineering, to develop the AIDS virus artificially is not a problem,
for this it is only necessary to add one gene to the virus causing a
similar disease among sheep. There is ample evidence to believe that
such an operation has been carried out at a secret American
laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The journal also published a response to the letter by John Seale,
who wrote about the articles that were published in October and December
1985 in the Soviet magazine <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>, and then he
wrote: <span class="quote">"These Soviet articles led me to consider
seriously the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have
been man-made."</span> I don't know if he is supposed to have read the
Russian-language articles or translated versions of the articles, or how
he found the articles. Was the Soviet magazine even available in the
UK?</p>
<p>The person who sent the letter to the journal appears to have
misunderstood what Moscow Radio meant by Seale's report. In the paper by
Seale that was published in August 1985 by the <em>Journal of the Royal
Society of Medicine</em>, Seale did not yet write about the Visna
theory, and he didn't even speculate that HIV would be a bioweapon.
[<a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801</a>]</p>
<p>So by Seale's report, Moscow Radio might have rather referred to the
article that was published in the communist newspaper <em>Morning
Star</em> a few days before the radio show, or to Seale's interview with
the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> or with LaRouche's <em>Executive
Intelligence Review</em> magazine. Seales's interview with the EIR was
published on October 18th 1985, so it actually predates the first
article published in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> by about two
weeks.</p>
<p>But anyway, I don't know if Seale, Strecker, or Segal presented the
Visna theory first. None of them seemed to credit the others as a source
for the Visna theory. Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span
class="quote">"The Streckers, who were manifestly eccentric, were never
to be mentioned in Segal's publications, never to be credited as an
influence. The Segals did keep track of Robert Strecker, but they began
to only in July 1987, as Lilli told an East German writer, Stefan Heym,
in a telephone conversation recorded by the Stasi.[89]"</span></p>

I saved the following excerpts from the paper as notes.</p>
<hr />
<p>The story of how the Strecker brothers became involved in HIV
research sounds phony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1983 two brothers were, supposedly, engaged by the Security
Pacific Bank of Los Angeles, California, to form a health-maintenance
organization, an HMO. The local prevalence and typical actuarial costs
of AIDS cases would logically have altered the prospects of any such
plan. One brother was Robert B. Strecker, presenting himself as an
MD-PhD internist-gastroenterologist-pathologist-pharmacologist; the
other was Theodore A. Strecker, presenting himself as an attorney. A
literature review proceeded. Theodore <span class="quote">"had
difficulty estimating the probable cost of the <span
class="quote">'Human Retroviruses'</span> as related to [insurance]

<p>The theory that AIDS virus was a recombinant virus had been presented
in November 1985 by someone who used the pseudonym <span
class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AIDS agent comprised parts of two different retroviruses. Segal
agreed with the Streckers and others that HIV might have been the
product of directed recombination. Preliminary investigations had indeed
prompted Hiroyuki Toh and Takashi Miyata[87] and <span
class="quote">"Booby Hatch"</span>[88] to consider this possibility in
communications published 4 July 1985 and November 1985 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sources he cited were a paper in <em>Nature</em> titled <span
class="quote">"Is the AIDS virus recombinant?"</span> by two Japanese
authors, and an article titled <span class="quote">"AIDS. Eine <span
class="quote">'Altlast'</span> der Forschung?"</span> published in a
magazine called <em>Wechselwirkung</em>.</p>
<p>However Geissler and Sprinkle wrote that <span class="quote">"Booby
Hatch"</span> did not say HIV had a laboratory origin: <span
class="quote">"<span class="quote">'Booby Hatch,'</span> who even today,
three decades on, refuses to allow disclosure of his real name,[45,176]
worried about laboratory safety and biosecurity, not politics - except
by identifying with <span class="quote">'the Green movement [der
Grünenbewegung] 'and holding in contempt 'the whole political complex
whether East or West [der ganze politische Komplex ob Ost oder
West].'</span> He did not support the myth, did not think the HIV had
been produced artificially or purposefully, and willingly ascribed to
simian origins for the AIDS agents.[45,88]"</span> Footnotes 45 and 176
referred to emails from Booby Hatch and from the editor of the
<em>Wechselwirkung</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle also wrote that <span class="quote">"Booby
Hatch"</span> met with Segal and Heimo Claasen, who made a film about
the AIDS conspiracy: <span class="quote">"Claasen met with Segal late in
1986 and followed with a Claasen-Segal-'Booby Hatch' meeting.[418]
According to Segal, Claasen proposed that Segal, <span
class="quote">'Booby Hatch,'</span> and others collaborate in a book to
be called <em>AIDS aus dem Genlabor?</em> [AIDS from a Gene Laboratory?]
and find a leftist publishing house to produce it.[419]"</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In the book <em>Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret
Police</em>, John Koehler wrote that Segal was still a die-hard Marxist
in 1991 and Segal still stuck to his story about HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his third paragraph, Koehler added this: <span class="quote">"I
spotted Segal's name in Stasi documents. ... In a 1991 interview with me
in Berlin, Segal presented himself as a die-hard Marxist, totally
incapable of accepting the demise of communist East Germany. Segal, then
eighty years old, insisted that his information on the origin of the HIV
virus [sic] was solid, and he denied having had any contact with the
Stasi. He was lying."</span>[103]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal sent a copy of his booklet to Japan on request of his Jewish
friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal's work was now ostensibly <span class="quote">"in press"</span>
in West Germany - and under a distinguished editor. His other 12 March
1986 transmission was not in German but in English, and it went to
Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Professor [Shingo] Shibata, our common friend Eva Brück
[according to the Center for Jewish History a Holocaust survivor and the
author of <em>Shadows of the Past: Childhood Years in Austria
1933-1938</em>] gave me the advice, to send you a paper my wife an [sic]
I just finished. It deals with the origin of AIDS and concludes, that
this disease did not originate in Central Africa and come to us via the
Green Monkey, but that the AIDS virus is a chimera from HTLV-I and visna
virus, performed by gene surgery in the P-4 laborators [sic] of Fort
Detrick, Maryland, USA, in the fall 1977.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal worked with the Stasi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Segals many years earlier had moved to East Berlin after the
Soviet consulate in Paris had <span class="quote">"proposed"</span> they
do so.[149] Jakob had then become an active unofficial Stasi
informer.[150] [...] Segal had been assigned to a Fübrungsoffizier - <span
class="quote">"an intelligence officer directly responsible for an
individual agent"</span>[153] named Captain Kairies. But in 1955 Segal
had been shuffled over to new direction. Captain Kairies had filed this
note: <span class="quote">"Today instructed by comrade advisor not to
have additional meetings with Segal. All actions that can be performed
by S. are to be arranged by instructor."</span>[154] The terms <span
class="quote">"comrade advisor"</span> and <span
class="quote">"instructor"</span> usually referred to officers of the
KGB responsible for maintenance of cooperation with the MfS. By 1962 the
MfS had decided to end its cooperation with Segal. Its reasons were
substantive: <span class="quote">"[H]e adopts a platform contrary to the
DAW [Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, German Academy of
Sciences at Berlin]. ... Information provided by him is very general ...
[and] the IM [the informer, Segal] is shunned by many
scientists."</span>[155]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Werner Grossman was the head of the Stasi's reconnaissance department
HVA. His publisher sent an email to Geissler which said that <span
class="quote">"the KGB initiated the affair involving Segal"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2011, Colonel General Werner Grossmann - from 1986 Deputy Minister
of State Security and successor to Markus Wolf as head of HVA[157] -
said in response to our inquiry, but through his publisher, <span
class="quote">"that the KGB initiated the affair involving Segal
[<em>die Sache mit Segal initiiert habe</em>]."</span>[158]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"No document
available to us proves or refutes the claim that the KGB invented the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth or that the KGB in <span
class="quote">'initiating the affair'</span> told Segal what ideas to
have rather than urging him to promote the ideas he already did have or
already had borrowed, whether or not he credited all his own
sources."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Soviet sources promoted the Segals, Strecker, and Seale, who all
claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Visna and some other virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For public consumption, as noted by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>,
Soviet stories consistently cited four conveniently vocal conspiracy
theorists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert Strecker, invariably described only as an <span
class="quote">"American scientist;"</span> John Seale, <span
class="quote">"a prominent specialist working in London,"</span> and the
East German husband-wife team of Jacob [sic] and Lilli Segal, whom the
Soviet press often identifies as French.[33]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Fort Detrick story was promoted by Rolf Wagenbrecht, who was the
head of the disinformation department of Stasi. Günter Bohnsack was the
head of the <span class="quote">"trade and industry"</span> section of
the disinformation department, but the three people he named as being
responsible for promoting disinformation about HIV were Jakob Segal,
Stefan Heym, and Johannes Mario Simmel, who were all Jews (German
original text omitted here):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long thereafter, on 27 January 1992, AIDS disinformation entered
its exponential phase, its disinformation-squared phase.
<em>Panorama</em>, a German television news magazine, was reporting that
the story of HIV having spread from Fort Detrick <span
class="quote">"after a geneaccident ... had been elaborated by the Russian
KGB and the Stasi, as [Colonel Dr. Rolf] Wagenbreth and his team boast
today. They also took responsibility for its world-wide
dissemination."</span>[177] When Segal had most actively been
propagating the myth, Wagenbreth had been head of Department X - the
<span class="quote">"X"</span> meaning <span class="quote">"10"</span>
of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance, HV A; thus, Wagenbreth had
been head of HV A/X. His responsibility, about which he refused to
comment during the broadcast, had been disinformation.</p>
<p>Stasi veterans, their civil liberties assured, were stepping up to
brag: to take credit, not to take blame. More soon followed, Günter
Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer most notably. Bohnsack said he had been
head of HV A/X Section 7, <span class="quote">"Trade and
Industry,"</span>[178] but was later described as having beer
responsible for disinformation within HV A/X.[179] Brehmer said he had
been responsible for Westert agencies within HV A/X Section 5, <span
class="quote">"Secret Services."</span>[178]</p>
<p>That same year, 1992, Bohnsack and Brehme published a book,
<em>Auftrag Irreführung. Wie die Stas Politik im Westen machte</em>
[<em>Mission Misleading: How the Stasi Made Politics in the West</em>].
<span class="quote">"The superpower [the Soviet Union] dealt the
cards,"</span> they wrote, <span class="quote">"and also took care not
to reveal its own hand. It respected the junior partner [the GDR], but
saw the appropriate balance of power at the negotiation table through
Moscow's eyes - and so the GDR shrunk back to being a small country in
central Europe."</span> Then came five paragraphs about the myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Moscow communicated clearly when it came to the planned AIDS
campaign against the USA. The quick spread of this terrible disease to
millions of people, especially in Africa, renewed the discussion about
the origin of the virus. During this time, a number of theses and
theories were proposed; a prominent one among them was that new genetic
research undertaken in the US could have produced a deformed organism
that threatened humanity. With this background, the concept for the
campaign practically wrote itself. The campaign allowed us to tie in our
other active measures, such as our argument, launched to reach across
the world, that the United States already had experience with germ
warfare in Korea.</p>
<p>The substance of our disinformation action consisted of the following
propositions: The AIDS virus was created in a special secure virus and
gene laboratory of the military research institute in Fort Detrick
(Maryland/USA). By 1977 it had passed via experimental subjects
uncontrolled into the public sphere and had initiated the deadly
catastrophe. The USA as repository of all threats - the classic closeup
used by the East. And the HVA went all out to publicize the idea.</p>
<p>First, the East Berlin professor Jakob Segal took up this version.
Stefan Heym made sure, through an interview he conducted for the West
Berlin [daily newspaper] <em>tageszeitung (taz)</em> with the scientist,
to spread the AIDS lie in Europe, [and] journalists carried the story to
Africa and to other regions afflicted by the disease.</p>
<p>Finally, the best-selling author Johannes Mario Simmel, who was then
writing about the topic of genetic research, availed himself innocently
of the materials sent to him and adopted the details of our
construction. The corresponding passages appear in the 1987 novel
<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>, published by Droemer
Knaur in Munich. A masterpiece of active measures, as one in the GDR
leadership circle found it to be.</p>
<p>Who contributed knowingly to disseminating this dirty story and who
deceived themselves and let themselves be used is an open question. The
subsequent General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev,
did, by the way, apologize to the United States for this
action.[105]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The communist Jew Samuel Mitja Rapoport proposed to publish a daily
newspaper about the AIDS conspiracy theory in November 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 29 November, Dr. Helmut Theodor, a high-ranking staffer at the GDR
Ministry of Health, noted that Samuel Mitja Rapoport, Professor of
Biochemistry at Humboldt University and a leading communist health
politician as well as Segal's colleague and close friend, had proposed
<span class="quote">"to publish in the daily news a paper on AIDS.
Objective: The AIDS agent has been manipulated and has escaped from an
American laboratory (biological weapons)."</span>[197] Referring to
reports about the presence of antibodies against the AIDS agent in sera
taken in Africa between 1960 and 1965 - and presumably also because his
superior, Health Minister Professor Ludwig Mecklinger, had decided
already by early 1984 not to deal with the AIDS problem in public[298] -
Theodor rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>This story is a little strange, since Rapoport never dealt with the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth in any of his numerous publications. He might
have realized soon that the myth was totally unfounded.[198] Or Theodor
might not have been informed correctly. Perhaps the proposal came not
from Rapoport but from Segal. Documents available to us are silent on
this question.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1985, three days after Theodor's rejection of the
putative Rapoport proposal, Segal wrote to Müller-Hill, mentioning a
suspicion raised primarily <span class="quote">"in the Indian newspaper
Citizen [sic] and"</span> secondarily in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
that the AIDS agent had been assembled, through genetic engineering, to
be a biological weapon.[104] Neither of the Segals was to mention either
article in any published work.</p>
</blockquote>

(<em>Bundesarchiv</em>): <span class="quote">"Helmut Theodor, note. 29
November 1985. BArch DQ1 13080. Translated by E.G."</span>.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Samuel Mitja Rapoport says: <span
class="quote">"Of Jewish descent and a committed communist, he fled
Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany, and moved to the United
States. In 1950, as a result of an investigation of un-American
activities, he was offered a professorship in East Berlin."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Mitja_Rapoport>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Mitja_Rapoport</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal were members of a division of Stasi that was
responsible for gathering scientific and technical information published
in western countries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob Segal was just an <span class="quote">"IM,"</span> an
<em>inoffizieller Mitarbeiter</em> or <span class="quote">"unofficial
collaborator,"</span> an informer for the Ministry for State Security -
one of approximately 180,000 IMs reporting to the MfS.[230,231] Whether
he was actively informing in the mid-1980s we do not know. Lilli,
however, did report to the MfS at least twice on the interest of the US
Embassy in East Berlin in Jakob's activities.[81,116] No document
reveals whether she was asked to provide such reports or provided them
conscientiously - or prudentially.</p>
<p>In one document dealing with the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth, Colonel
Oldenburg, deputy head of Department IX/C of the HV A, mentioned that
Segal and his wife <span class="quote">"are registered by HV
A/SWT/XIII."</span>[232] This registration was of long-standing and
could not have related to AIDS. Moreover, responsibilities of the
departments chancing upon the Segals' AIDS activities did not include
<span class="quote">"active measures."</span> Department IX of the HV A
performed external counter-intelligence, especially in West Germany.
Department HV A/SWT was responsible for the gathering of scientific and
technical information in developed <span class="quote">"capitalistic
countries."</span> HA II, among whose filings were found Lilli's two
reports and Oldenburg's comment on the Segals' registration, was
responsible for counter-intelligence activities within the GDR
proper.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>An interview of Segal was published in a West German newspaper by
Stefan Heym, who was a Jew who worked for a psychological warfare unit
of the US Army:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soon, though, readers would see Segal himself defending his claims
eloquently in an interview published 18 February 1987 in West Berlin in
the daily newspaper <em>tageszeitung</em> (<em>taz</em>).[86]</p>
<p>The interview was performed and published by Stefan Heym (1913-2001),
a widely admired journalist and public intellectual. In 1933, Helmut
Flieg, a German Jew, fled to Czechoslovakia, becoming Stefan Heym. In
1935, he moved on to the United States, where he attended the University
of Chicago and became an American citizen. In 1943 Heym joined a
psychological-warfare unit of the US Army and the next year took part in
the Normandy landings; these experiences formed the background for one
of his best known novels, <em>The Crusaders</em>. Protesting the Korean
War, Heym in 1951 returned all his American military decorations and
left the US for Prague, Czechoslovakia, and in 1952 for East Berlin,
where he became famous as a writer and dissident, his pseudonym by then
a pen name. Although steadfastly a socialist, Heym published articles
and books sharply critical of the politically repressive behaviors of
Soviet-bloc leaders, including leaders in the GDR. Much of his work
could be published only in the West, and Heym was observed and harassed
by the Stasi intensely.[321,322,323,324] Not least because of harassment
itself, Heym's publications found broad interest in both Germanies and
abroad, and attention to the Segal interview was widespread. In
following issues the <em>taz</em> published numerous received comments,
many of which were later compiled by Kuno Kruse in his book <em>AIDS -
Pathogens from a Gene Laboratory?</em>[243]</p>
<p>Heym became the subject of an <em>Operativer Vorgang</em> or
<em>OV</em>, an <span class="quote">"operational procedure,"</span> and
he became a victim of <em>OV Diversant</em>. The aim of <em>OV
Diversant</em> was to monitor and frustrate: <span class="quote">"by
evaluation of the manner of his connections into the NSW [non-socialist
currency area, meaning the West] to examine whether Heym acts on demand
of secret services (or) other hostile organizations of individuals [and]
to restrict his further hostile activities by appropriate politically
operative measures[.]"</span> This was all to be accomplished through
IMs - unofficial informers to the MfS - and by activities of HA XX in
cooperation with HV A, HA II, and friendly security services.[325]
(Figure 15)</p>
<p>According to Boghardt, Heym's <span class="quote">"enlistment in the
AIDS campaign was a major coup for Segal and the HVA."</span>[301] The
term <span class="quote">"enlistment"</span> suggests that Heym became a
knowing participant in disinformation, yet Boghardt and his sources have
not speculated on how the Stasi might have succeeded in recruiting one
of their most resilient victims. Boghardt has also written that <span
class="quote">"like his interviewee [Segal] he [Heym] was probably
unaware of HVA involvement."</span>[301] The implication here is that
the Stasi controlled these two, making them act as they otherwise would
not have acted, that it controlled them so effectively, so cleverly, so
subtly that they <span class="quote">"probably"</span> never caught on.
Heym had been <span class="quote">"enlisted"</span> subliminally. This
implication is not reconcilable with archival findings or live
questioning. Actually, the Stasi initially were aware of neither Heym's
interest nor his Segal interview. Heym's physician, Professor Doctor
Dagobert Müller, had drawn his patient's attention to an item written by
Jakob Segal. [326] Heym immediately grew fascinated by the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth. This was 9 October 1986; in his diary,
unpublished but kindly provided to us by his widow, Inge Heym, he
recorded the date.[327] What was the item his physician had? A copy of
the draft paper received by Bond? A copy of the material Segal had
provided to African journalists? A Harare handout? We know neither what
it was nor how he came to have it. In June 2007, one of us, E.G., gained
access to part of Stefan Heym's estate. There, in a box containing many
AIDS-related books and articles, was nothing likely to have been the
item shown to Heym by his physician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Heym says: <span class="quote">"He was a
member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the
command of émigré Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts
designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet,
radio and loudspeaker."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Heym>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Heym</a>]
Hans Habe was a Jew who fled from Germany to America in 1940.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Habe>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Habe</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>A Jewish fiction writer wrote a popular novel about the AIDS
theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prominent among the Stasi's surmised successes was inducing a
venerable Austrian author to write a novel advertising the myth as
reality.</p>
<p>Johannes Mario Simmel was born in Vienna in 1924. His father, a
chemist, was a Jew; at the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by
Germany in 1938, the elder Simmel fled to London.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Still more information, especially about how and with what success
the Stasi used Simmel as their instrument, was added by Klaus Behling,
the former GDR diplomat, in a short article in the widely circulated
German newspaper BILD[179] and in an additional book.[365]</p>
<p>Boghardt has written that the <span class="quote">"biggest
coup"</span> of the HV A was to send Simmel <span
class="quote">"material pertaining to Segal's AIDS theory"</span> and
then to find that he had used it as hoped in a work of popular
fiction.[366] The background for this claim was Behling's 8 April 2000
BILD article, <span class="quote">"Stasi eavesdropper: The AIDS lie and
the misused Simmel."</span> Behling had quoted Bohnsack, who</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reveals the disinformation campaigns of the Stasi. By means of
telephone surveillance we learned that Johannes Mario Simmel planned to
write a book on biological weapons. We passed material on to him, [and]
a GDR scientist named Prof. Segal - our IM [our informer] - provided
expertise. In his novel <em>Doch mit den Clowns kamen die Träanen</em>
[<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>] the legend was
disseminated a million times over that the AIDS virus escaped from a
weapons laboratory of the USA. Our aim was to make the Africans angry
against the USA because that plague is most widespread there.[179]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>After the war, Simmel worked as a translator and interpreter for the
United States Office of Military Government in occupied Austria.

<p>The DC Spy Museum historian Thomas Boghardt relied on false
information from the former Stasi disinformation agent Günter
Bohnsack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have supported their interpretation by reference
to the former Stasi officers Bohnsack and Brehmer, who we found
untrustworthy, and by reference to Boghardt, whose confidence in
Bohnsack worked seriously against him. Notably, Boghardt's exposition of
the Segals' contacts with American diplomats - Bohnsack had persuaded
Boghardt these had been Stasi officers impersonating CIA agents
pretending to be American diplomats[29] - we proved to have been
erroneous. One of the American diplomats had gone on to become United
States Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus and kindly described to us
his Segal contacts in detail.[30]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Segal finished an early draft of his thesis in January 1986, which
was after Seele had presented the Visna hypothesis in December 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No later than 3 October 1985 Segal had come to doubt the African
origin of HIV and mentioned <span class="quote">"strong indications that
AIDS evolved in the US research center for biological warfare in Fort
Detrick by genetic engineering."</span>[31] A first draft of his thesis
was ready by January 1986;[57] Segal's protégé and sometime coauthor
Ronald Dehmlow secretly shared parts of this thesis with HA VII/7, the
MfS department conducting counter-espionage at Dehmlow's place of
work.[58]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>People from Stasi were opposed to Segal's hypothesis and thought it
might harm the reputation of GDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some departments of the Stasi also examined this report. An officer
of the department responsible for counter-intelligence in economic and
scientific affairs informed other departments of the MfS, including the
Regional Administration East Berlin, that <span
class="quote">"[o]fficials of the ministry of Health as well as
Humboldt-University Berlin, who deal with the AIDS problem and with
homosexuality, share the opinion that Segal's claim is not tenable from
a scientific and medical view."</span>[106] Selvage and Nehring have not
mentioned this letter.</p>
<p>Major Dewitz of the Stasi's East Berlin Administration initiated a
comprehensive evaluation of Segal's claims.[107] Dewitz, too, in a
comprehensive four-page memorandum, concluded that <span
class="quote">"all GDR experts are convinced that Prof. Segal's theory
is untenable."</span> But that was a scientific consensus. What Dewitz
described next, though, was a political consensus, that Segal's
activities <span class="quote">"are considered to be politically
harmful"</span> and that spreading the myth generated <span
class="quote">"disadvantages for the GDR"</span> - <span
class="quote">"scientific disadvantages,... economic disadvantages... and
political disadvantages."</span>[108] Consequently, the Stasi, <span
class="quote">"Shield and Sword of the Party,"</span> should not support
but rather should suppress Segal's activities. Major Dewitz went on to
contemplate measures <span class="quote">"[t]o protect the esteem of the
GDR with appropriate measures"</span> by making Segal desist.[109]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At one point Segal claimed that Gallo had created HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greenwald referred to a Segal interview published in an Austrian
journal, Basta. In that interview Segal had not only g/repeated his
allegations but had also asserted that virologist Robert Gallo - along
with Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi a co-discoverer of HIV was
responsible for the creation of the AIDS agent through genetic
manipulation.[141] Later Segal explained that <span class="quote">"the
Pentagon simply purchased Gallo."</span>[142]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The Segals may have been presented as French to downplay their ties
to the eastern bloc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September 1986 in <span class="quote">"Pentagon behind
AIDS?"</span> Moscow's New Times referred to <span class="quote">"French
scientists Jacob and Lily [sic] Segal."</span>[145] Later the GDR's
Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs described Jakob Segal as
French.[135,138] But the Ministry of State Security - the MfS or Stasi -
knew Segal was a citizen of the Soviet Union. USDoS also knew this:
<span class="quote">"Throughout the early and middle stages of the
disinformation campaign, Soviet-bloc media repeatedly misidentified
Segal as a French national."</span> USDoS assumed disinformation in
<span class="quote">"an effort to downplay his ties to the
G.D.R."</span> But USDoS also suggested not disinformation but
<em>misinformation</em>: <span class="quote">"Segal, who resides in East
Berlin but claims to have graduated from the Sorbonne in 1940, has been
repeatedly misidentified as a French researcher."</span>[146]</p>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have seen here only disinformation: an attempt to
hide Segal's ties to East Berlin ties that Segal himself made patently
obvious again and again. Pretending Segal was French, Selvage and
Nehring have proposed, would have been advantageous since <span
class="quote">"AIDS disinformation spread from the East ought to be
supported by <span class="quote">'Western
scientists.'</span>"</span>[147]</p>

Emory did several radio shows about the theory that HIV was an American
bioweapon, and he had Len Horowitz, Alan Cantwell, and Ed Haslam as
guests on his show. A frequent guest on his show was Adam Finnegan's
mentor John Loftus, who is a leftist conspiracy theorist like Emory who
finds Nazis hiding under every rock. Loftus is a former military
intelligence officer, and he said that he learned about the history of
biowarfare from the publisher of his book, who was a former high-level
CIA agent.

already authored 20 novels, numerous screenplays, and various short

<p>Around 1987, HVA X gave Segal material <span class="quote">"from

Donald MacArthur, then deputy director of research and engineering in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In his testimony, MacArthur
stated that <span class="quote">"within a period of five to 10 years it
would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have
been acquired."</span> He elaborated further that <span class="quote">"A
research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed
in approximately five years at a total cost of $10
million."</span>[100]</p>
<p>For Segal, the MacArthur testimony was near-certain evidence that the
Pentagon had not only contemplated an HIV-type virus since 1969 but also
had gone through with the project within the 10-year time frame
MacArthur had suggested. Henceforth, MacArthur's testimony became a
cornerstone of Segal's conspiracy theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacArthur's testimony is also frequently quoted by Nick the
Spacecat.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote that Segal later started to blame Gallo for creating
the virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his earlier publications and utterances, Segal had dispassionately
and largely accurately described Gallo's contribution to the
identification of HIV, but he sharply changed his tack in the late
1980s, when Gallo became the key figure in Segal's theory. In his final
years, Segal developed an apparent pathological hatred of Gallo as the
man personally responsible for creating AIDS, and he seized every
opportunity to lambast the American scientist.</p>
<p>In 1989, just one year before East Germany's demise, Segal went on a
lecture tour across West Germany. Even though the SED leadership had
avoided endorsing Segal and he did not travel as an official GDR
representative, his trip was inconceivable without the Politburo's
knowledge and approval. In his presentations, Segal touted his latest
piece of evidence - the MacArthur hearing of 1969 - and pilloried
Gallo.[103] According to the recollections of one of his listeners,
Segal referred to Gallo as <span class="quote">"a huge gangster"</span>
[ein ganz grosser Gangster] who was responsible for creating the
virus.[104]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Segal's last major accomplishment during the Cold War was the
publication in 1990 of his book <em>AIDS - die Spur führt ins
Pentagon</em> [<em>AIDS - the trail leads to the Pentagon</em>], which
incorporated the bits on Gallo and the MacArthur hearing into his
original thesis. The book was published by <em>Neuer Weg</em>, a
publishing house closely associated with the far-left, Maoist Marxist
Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD).</p>

<p>Nick the Spacecat also claims that Gallo was involved in creating

<a href=#Lilli_Segal id=Lilli_Segal>Lilli Segal</a>
</h2>
<p>A biography of Lilli Segal said:
[<a href=https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/>https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His second wife, Edith Albrecht, threatened to denounce Lilli to the
police as a communist, to make her leave the shared residence. Because
of the tightening restrictions for Jews in Germany, Lilli moved to
France in 1933 and studied at the Toulouse University of
Agriculture.</p>
<p>During her stay in Toulouse she met the student Jakob Segal, a
Lithuanian national, who was a member of the German Communist Party
(KPD). He had immigrated to France because of his involvement in the
communist <span class="quote">'Red Student Union'</span>. They married
on May 25, 1935 and Lilli was given Lithuanian citizenship by virtue of
the marriage, which made her a citizen of the Soviet Union from
1940.</p>
<p>Due to her non-German nationality, Lilli Segal was able to travel to
Germany without any difficulties after 1935. During these trips she took
on several missions for the KPD without being a member of the party.
These were among other things the housing of endangered comrades, the
production and distribution of leaflets, and courier activities. In
addition, she remained in contact with a group of Bavarian Catholic
officers who were opponents of the Hitler regime. They provided her with
money for political work.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of war, Lilli Segal worked in a laboratory in
Paris from 1937. She joined the French Communist Party, with which she
was regularly involved until the beginning of the war. Because they
feared that she was under surveillance by the Gestapo, the French
comrades broke off the connection with her.</p>
<p>When Germany occupied France, she left Paris and lived in Mende. In
the summer of 1943 party leaders decided to transfer Lilli Segal to the
same working group as her husband, because both had lived together for a
long time and worked in the same office.</p>
<p>From 1943 until her arrest she worked as a so-called liaison agent
for her husband, who worked at the technical headquarters of a party
section which dealt with transporting materials, as well as the contact
management of liaisons with the headquarters.</p>
<p>The persecution of party official Paul Grasse led the police to their
office in the summer of 1943. With the arrest of a number of German and
Austrian party comrades on November 23rd Paul Grasse also
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lilli Segal was also questioned by the French police (see picture
above) at the Prefecture de Police. She was not cooperative and was
arrested as a result. After a month, she was handed over by the French
police to the German run jail of Fresnes, where she remained until the
end of June 1944.</p>
<p>At the end of June, she was taken to Drancy, and after a month, on 31
July 1944, Lilli Segal was deported to Auschwitz in Convoi 77. In the
train, she made contact with two Austrian comrades; one of them was Anni
Sussmann, with whom she was transferred in November 1944 to a Labour
unit at Kratzau in the Sudetenland. (1)</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>After returning to France, Lilli Segal continued working for the
French Communist Party until 1947. (5) Since it became prohibited for
Soviet citizens to work for a political party abroad, she left France
together with her husband, Jakob Segal, and they emigrated to the German
Democratic Republic. From 1948 she worked in the GDR in various official
political organizations, e.g. as an interpreter. (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper,
Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"The Segals had both
become Soviet citizens following the Soviet Union's annexation of
Lithuania in 1940, and in autumn 1952, as Lilli later wrote, <span
class="quote">'they had been asked to see the Soviet consulate [in
Paris]. The consul proposed to us that we move to Berlin, in the German
Democratic Republic.'</span>[75] They accepted the consul's proposal, in
late December 1952 going to Humboldt University, East Berlin."</span>
[<a href=f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf>f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf</a>]
But the biography I quoted above said that the Segals moved to the GDR
in 1948 and not 1952, so I don't know what explains the discrepancy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Geissler and Sprinkle wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob and Lilli were both biologists, but they were also both Jews
and communists and partisans of the French resistance. In Paris on 21
November 1943, Lilli was arrested by Vichy French police and
interrogated over several weeks. On 20 December she was transferred to
German authorities and spent the next eight months in a Wehrmacht prison
nearby in Fresnes. In August 1944, with Allied armies threatening from
the west and the south, Lilli was deported. After four days on a train
she arrived at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland.[72] Lilli was an
inmate there while anthropologist-physician Josef Mengele, <span
class="quote">"Der Todesengel [the Death Angel],"</span> was conducting
inhumane experiments - on twins when he could get them. Mengele sorted
arriving prisoners, sending most to die, selecting some as workers,
others as subjects. He selected Lilli. <span class="quote">"Someone
shouted: <span class="quote">'Old people and mothers with kids to the
left, women to the right [Alte und Frauen mit Kindern links, Frauen
rechts].'</span> ... It was Dr. Mengele. ... The majority of us were killed
immediately after arrival by gas, including 300 kids from an
orphanage."</span>[73] In November 1944, after a second selection by
Mengele, Lilli was transferred to a slave-labor camp near Zittau, in
Saxony, to manufacture aircraft parts. From Zittau on 20 November 1944
she escaped. Lilli made her way to Switzerland and then in March 1945 to
a liberated Paris.[74]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They cited Lilli Segal's book <em>Vom Widerspruch zum
Widerstand</em>.</p>
<p>Lilli Segal may have also produced disinformation about the Holocaust
and not only HIV. A common trope among Auschwitz survivors is that they
claim they were personally selected by Josef Mengele when they arrived
to Auschwitz. In his biography of Mengele, the Jewish mainstream
historian David Marwell wrote: <span class="quote">"Historian Zdenek
Zofka notes that many survivors recall Mengele speaking to them in
Hungarian, a language he did not speak but which was spoken by his
colleagues, the pharmacist Viktor Capesius and the physician Dr. Fritz
Klein. Often Mengele would be described as tall and blond, when he was
only 5ft 8½ inches tall and dark-haired.[31] <span class="quote">'Almost
all inmates'</span> at Auschwitz, according to Zofka, maintain that they
had been selected by Mengele. [...] Geoffrey Hartmann, who wrote
extensively on survivor testimony, observed that <span
class="quote">'every Auschwitz survivor seems to have gone through a
selection by Mengele, as if he manned his post 24 hours a
day.'</span>[34] In fact, Mengele took his turn at ramp duty like the
rest of the medical staff in the camp. There is no evidence that he
served there more frequently or for longer hours than his
colleagues."</span>
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCCfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT77>https://books.google.com/books?id=JCCfDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT77</a>]
The former Auschwitz inmate Hermann Langbein wrote: <span
class="quote">"More than once I heard survivors say that Mengele did
this or that to them, even though Mengele had not yet arrived in
Auschwitz at the time."</span>
[<a href=https://libgen.li/index.php?req=langbein+people+auschwitz>https://libgen.li/index.php?req=langbein+people+auschwitz</a>]
The testimony of Schlomo Dragan is one of the main sources for the
mainstream history about the Sonderkommando, but he said that when he
arrived to Auschwitz in December 1942, he was selected by Mengele, even
though in reality Mengele did not arrive to Auschwitz until May 1943.

Lehrman presented Duesberg's theory that HIV did not cause AIDS, but on
the other hand he also presented the theory of the Segals that HIV was a
bioweapon, and he reconciled the two theories by asking: <span

infective agent intended to be blamed for the chemical poisoning it
actually accompanies?"</span> In the fashion of Sasha Latypova, he
proposed that AIDS was caused by an unspecified poison or toxic

were provided to a Russian journalist by an editor of CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast dark cloud of billions of buzzing mosquitoes swarms toward a
distant city skyline. The lead mosquito's legs are armored with spikes,
its eyes and mouth so magnified they appear gigantic. At second glance,
the creature's mouth is not that of a normal mosquito, but an
engineered, razor-sharp syringe. The swarm is emanating from the dark
eye sockets of a human skull, a skull smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>This bizarre illustration appeared in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
on February 3, 1982, above a long story titled <span
class="quote">"Incubator of Death."</span> The piece, written in the
first person, was a kind of travelogue into a CIA factory for weaponised
mosquitoes. The author, Iona Andronov, started his adventure after
visiting the editor of <span class="quote">"the journal <span
class="quote">'Covert Action'</span> in Washington,"</span> (a reference
to <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>). That Washington editor
showed Andronov, he claimed, <span class="quote">"leaked documents from
the CIA"</span> that led his investigation to Lahore, Pakistan. En route
from Moscow to Lahore, Andronov recounted, his luggage was taken away
during a layover, then he was followed by Pakistani security, and
diplomatic phone numbers appeared to mysteriously stop working. American
spies were on his heels. Nevertheless, the intrepid reporter managed to
charm his way into the secret mosquito lab.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The killer mosquito story was part of a larger, more complex campaign
to deflect blame, and to compromise the U.S. and NATO over biological
and chemical weapons. The campaign was code-named TARAKANY, <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> in Russian. Even if the Soviet claim
that the CIA was developing chemical weapons in Lahore was revealed as
fake, that revelation would make it easier for the USSR to claim that
the CIA's reports of Soviet chemical weapons in Afghanistan were equally
made-up. Just when the United States was getting ready to publish a
major report on Soviet chemical weapons, <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
alleged that the Pakistan Malaria Research Center was a CIA-funded
laboratory to breed weaponized mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The story was clumsy but creative. Iona Andronov depicted the
Americans he met in the <span class="quote">"mosquito factory"</span> as
cartoonish villains - fat, fiendish, crude, and cunning. The University
of Maryland lab in Lahore and its fight against malaria, he claimed, was
only a façade; behind it were <span class="quote">"poisoners from
overseas"</span> who plotted to infect entire cattle herds with viruses
and then take advantage of the seasonal migration of the herds from
Pakistan to Afghanistan to start an epidemic of encephalitis in
Afghanistan. The Gazeta story also claimed that a recent outbreak of
dengue fever in Cuba had been caused by imported Lahore-bred mosquitoes.
TARAKANY replayed similar tales about U.S. killer germs in India, Iran,
Bangladesh, Lebanon, and South Africa. The KGB considered its <span
class="quote">"cockroaches"</span> campaign a big success, especially
after Service A concluded that Pakistan had declared the American head
of the University of Maryland lab in Lahore persona non grata as a
result of their work. Andropov, the chairman of the KGB, even awarded a
testimonial to his resident in Pakistan.[3]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Just a few months later, <em>Covert Action Information Bulletin</em>
published a special issue on chemical weapons. The Bulletin also claimed
that the same virulent 1981 outbreak of dengue fever in Cuba had been a
CIA operation - it was unclear whether the idea originated at Dupont
Circle or Yasenevo.[4] The Soviets launched an entire range of measures
in the early 1980s that attempted to blame various diseases on the
United States, particularly the Cuban outbreak of dengue fever.[5]</p>

<p>The story about the weaponized mosquitoes sounds just like a story
concocted by George Webb. It's only missing encrypted Blackberries and a
nuclear deal.</p>

Rid's book Active Measures</a>
</h2>
<p>In the book <em>Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation
and Political Warfare</em>, Thomas Rid wrote that when CAIB's founder
Philip Agee lived in London, he maintained contact with the KGB through
the London correspondent of <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day Agee approached the KGB rezidentura in Mexico City and
offered what one senior Soviet intelligence officer later called <span
class="quote">"reams of information about CIA operations."</span>[26]
The KGB Mexico station chief, however, suspected that Agee was a CIA
plant, what spies then called a <span class="quote">"dangle,"</span> an
undercover agent posing as a defector in order to inject disinformation
into the KGB, and rejected Agee. Agee then went to Cuba's foreign
intelligence agency, the Dirección General de Inteligencia, or DGI,
which welcomed its first high-profile CIA source with open arms and soon
shared Agee's file with the KGB.[27] Oleg Kalugin recalled the
disappointment of failing to recruit the American quasi-defector
himself: <span class="quote">"The Cubans shared Agee's information with
us. But as I sat in my office in Moscow, reading reports about the
growing list of revelations coming from Agee, I cursed our officers for
turning away such a prize."</span>[28]</p>
<p>In December 1971, Agee moved from Mexico to Paris, where he lived
hand-to-mouth at different addresses in the Fifth Arrondissement. It was
then that he began to entertain the idea of writing a tell-all book on
the CIA. From late 1972 to mid-1977, he lived first in London, then in
Truro, Cornwall, and finally in Cambridge, maintaining contact with the
KGB through the <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> correspondent in
London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>British authorities accused Agee of being a Soviet bloc influence
agent, and he was deported from the UK in 1977. After that he founded
CAIB. In the third issue of CAIB, he published a fake appendix to a US
intelligence manual which was written by the KGB according to Rid. CAIB
is supposed to have received the fake appendix from a person who
presented himself as an anonymous US Army whistleblower.</p>

<p>Rid wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1992, the head of Russian foreign intelligence, Yevgeny Primakov,
confirmed the KGB's role in the AIDS disinformation campaign during a
talk at MGIMO, an academic institute affiliated with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Moscow. Primakov revealed that the AIDS story was
<span class="quote">"created in the cabinets of the KGB,"</span>[47] and
had simply aimed to distract from the Red Army's use of chemical
weapons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He cited an article published in the <em>Izvestia</em> newspaper in
1992 titled <span class="quote">"Внешняя разведка ищет таланты"</span>.
The article said in Russian:

<blockquote>
<p>The head of the Foreign Intelligence Service issued a series of truly
sensational announcements. He recalled the well-known articles published
several years ago in our national newspapers about the alleged origins
of AIDS in secret Pentagon laboratories. According to Yevgeny Primakov,
the materials revealing the American scientists' <span
class="quote">"forged"</span> plot against humanity were concocted in
the offices of the KGB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Russian text said: <span class="quote">"По словам Е.
Примакова, материалы, раскрывающие «кованый» замысел американских ученых
против человечества, выдуманы в кабинетах КГБ."</span> (Where the word
<span class="quote">"кабинет"</span> means an office and not a filing
cabinet.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Jakob and Lilli Segal's booklet was distributed in 1986 in the Eighth
Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Harare, Zimbabwe. Rid wrote that
the conference served as a channel for the distribution of other Soviet
disinformation material, along with a list of CIA officers similar to
the list that was later published by CAIB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KGB was running DENVER as a joint campaign with help from partner
agencies.[31] Ten days after the conference, the deputy head of the X,
Wolfgang Mutz, traveled from Berlin to his partners in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Mutz briefed his counterparts on a long list of ongoing active measures.
One, code-named MIRROR, also boosted in Harare ten days earlier, was a
slim book nominally written by the East Berlin correspondent of
<em>Patriot</em> and <em>Blitz</em>, an investigative Indian weekly. The
book, <em>Devil and His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third
World</em>, was dripping with anti-American clichés and CIA conspiracy
theories. Mutz told the Bulgarians that it contained a list with the
names of 300 CIA officers,[32] again titled, like HVA's earlier volume,
<em>Who's Who in CIA</em>.[33] The Americans, Mutz added, had already
bought 600 copies of <span class="quote">"our book"</span> from the
publisher.[34] HVA had the book translated and published in German. The
Bulgarians agreed to help push the anti-CIA pamphlet into Lebanon and
Syria.</p>
<p>Then Mutz told his counterparts that the AIDS campaign, DENVER,
occupied <span class="quote">"a considerable amount"</span> of the
resources in his department, and added that another HVA department had
done <span class="quote">"a great deal of scientific work."</span> Mutz
was referring to the 52-page Segal study that had surfaced in Harare,
and to HVA's science and technology department, which listed Segal as a
collaborator.[35] The Bulgarians considered it challenging to find a
local scientist to <span class="quote">"support the German professor's
thesis."</span></p>
