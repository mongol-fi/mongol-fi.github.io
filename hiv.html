<a href=#Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Nick_the_Spacecats_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Nick
the Spacecat's Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick the Spacecat claims that HIV is a recombinant virus that
contains segments of the Visna-maedi virus.</p>
<p>He said <span class="quote">"I've seen there are 12 genes in HIV from
Visna"</span>, even though HIV doesn't even have 12 genes:
[<a href=https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801>https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-3.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>He also wasn't able to answer which part of the genome of HIV was
taken from HIV, but he just said that Gallo was <span
class="quote">"sizing up Visna as a dance partner for SIVs"</span>:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1874240728853078195</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-4.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>Here I again showed him similarity plots which showed why his Visna
recombination theory didn't make sense:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1880786821292101754</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-1.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>A month later he again posted the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, so I pointed out to him again that the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium formation:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1889686323109277853</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-2.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>He eventually blocked me because of these tweets:
[<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222>https://x.com/henjin256/status/1903818908898857222</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nickvisna-5.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>In March 2025 Nick hosted a video roundtable, which featured
presentations by himself, Adam Finnegan, Charles Rixey, and Aaron
Baalbergen. During his own presentation, Nick showed the graphic below
where he claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Visna and SIV, and he
said: <span class="quote">"And then they'd get a whole Brady Bunch of
different chimeras or hybrids. This is my very crude scientific
rendering of that process building HIV - and today's presentation is not
about the details of this - but <span class="quote">'viral
fusion'</span> are the keywords that you want to use if you'd like to
search more about this process."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974>https://rumble.com/v6qu21c-2025-spring-roundtable.html?start=3974</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-1.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>Then he showed a screenshot of the paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, and he said <span class="quote">"Here, in my opinion, is
the final step that created HIV, and that would be fusing this, a sheet
virus with that STLV we mentioned before."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/hiv-nick-spring-2.webp width=450>
</div>
<p>At that point I had already told him multiple times on Twitter and
Discord that the paper had nothing to do with the genomic recombination
of Visna and HIV, and the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span>
referred to syncytium formation and not recombination. So I told him on
Kevin McCairn's Discord that he seems to be deliberately producing
disinformation, because he should've realized himself how the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> referred to syncytium formation in the
paper. And I posted even more evidence on the Discord why his theory
didn't make sense.</p>
<p>However even after that Nick has kept posting screenshots of the
paper on Twitter:

<h2>
<a href=#Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis id=Origin_of_Visna_recombination_hypothesis>Origin
of Visna recombination hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>Nick's Visna recombination theory had earlier been presented by his
mentor Alan Cantwell. Cantwell in turn appears to have copied the theory
from Robert Strecker, who had presented it by March 1986 or earlier. The
Visna theory had also been presented by John Seale by December 1985, and
by Jakob Segal by May 1986. However I'm not sure if Strecker, Segal, or
Seale came up with the theory first.</p>
<p>In the book <span class="quote">"AIDS and the Doctors of
Death"</span>, Alan Cantwell wrote: <span class="quote">"I remember
distinctly the early morning phone call from Dr. Virginia
Livingston-Wheeler that started it all in August 1986."</span> And he
wrote she invited him to a meeting held by Robert Strecker, who <span
class="quote">"carefully explained the unique molecular composition of
the AIDS virus, emphasizing how it greatly resembles a virus in sheep
called <span class="quote">'visna virus.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>Cantwell also wrote that Strecker had presented the Visna theory in
his report dated March 1986: <span class="quote">"Strecker began to pass
out copies of a report entitled <span class="quote">'This is a
Bio-Attack Alert.'</span> The manuscript was dated March 28, 1986, and
was written by the Strecker brothers. The report contained detailed
information on their theory, and provided documented evidence to show
that the AIDS epidemic was biological warfare."</span> In the report
Strecker wrote: <span class="quote">"The AIDS virus is Bovine Visna
Virus (BVV) in man with a transacting transcriptional regulator gene
inherited from Bovine Leukemia Virus"</span>.
[<a href=https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/>https://strecker.pugik.com/bio-attack-alert/</a>]</p>
<p>In December 1985 the Los Angeles Times published an interview of John
Seale, which said: <span class="quote">"Seale, who is in private
practice and specializes in urinary and venereal diseases, said the AIDS
virus, which attacks the body's immune system, has one gene extra over
the Visna virus. [...] <span class="quote">'Inserting an extra gene into a
virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engineering,'</span>
Seale said."</span>

<p>In December 1985 the British communist newspaper <em>Morning
Star</em> also reported on statements by Seale. In the paper <span
class="quote">"Disinformation squared: Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick
myth a Stasi success?"</span>, Erhard Geissler and Robert Hunt Sprinkle
wrote:
[<a href=https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/disinformation-squared-was-the-hivfromfortdetrick-myth-a-stasi-success/8CFEA2F6B8FA780208DFAC39DC57A03E>https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/disinformation-squared-was-the-hivfromfortdetrick-myth-a-stasi-success/8CFEA2F6B8FA780208DFAC39DC57A03E</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 20 December 1985, nine days after <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
published its Drozdov interview, London's <em>Morning Star</em>, a
communist newspaper, reported that the New Zealand AIDS Foundation had
received a letter with claims similar to Professor Drozdov's. John Seale
had been reconsidering his presumption that the origin of HIV had been
natural. He now said that <span class="quote">"the AIDS virus may have
been manufactured in laboratories as a slow but deadly biological
warfare weapon."</span> He went on to say that <span
class="quote">"there was <span class="quote">'circumstantial
evidence'</span> to back the belief that the AIDS virus was genetically
engineered in a laboratory."</span>[56]</p>
<p>On 26 December 1985, Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">"World
Service,"</span> broadcasting in English, presented Seale's ominous new
inference as a conclusion.[57]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same paper also said that Jakob Segal had presented the Visna
theory by May 1986: <span class="quote">"Five months after his mention
on Moscow Radio, Seale was contacted by an ambitious new ally soon to
eclipse all earlier theorists. In a letter dated 29 May 1986, Jakob
Segal, a Soviet citizen long retired from a professorship of biology in
East Germany, wrote to suggest that <span class="quote">'the AIDS virus
is a chimera.'</span> By this he meant a recombinant of the human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and the Maedi-Visna
virus"</span>.</p>
<p>HTLV-I is not even a lentivirus, like HIV and Visna. Robert Strecker
also claimed that HIV was a recombinant of Bovine leukemia virus and
Visna, even though BLV is not a lentivirus. There is no part of the
genome of HIV that is anywhere close to HTLV-I or BLV.</p>
<p>In the 1986 report, Jakob Segal claimed that the <span
class="quote">"The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from
HTLV-I, its larger part with the 3' end from Visna virus"</span>:
[<a href=https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna>https://archive.org/details/AIDS-nature-and-origin/page/n9/mode/2up?q=visna</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hybridisation between Visna end LAV/HTL7-III takes an entirely
different course (fig.2c). The ranges of hybridisation are evenly
distributed over tne entire lenght [sic] of the genomes, making up
altogether 35 per cent of their lenght.</p>
<p>To investigate in how far coincidental conformities can simulat
hybridisation, the LAV/HTLV-III strand was implanted in a reversed
direction in a further experiment (fig.2d). In that case there is no
hybridisation at any point, which indicates that the relations
demonstrated in fig.2c are not conditioned by coincidence.</p>
<p>It is therefore clearly shown that in the main part of their genomes
Visna and LAV/HTLV-III are largely in conformity. The differences may
well lie in the magnitude of mutations. On the other hand in this part
of the genome LAV/HTLV-III fundamentally differs from the genome of
HTLV-I. It is therefore completely excluded that the HTLV-I should of
itself have changed, by an unfortunate combination of mutations, into
the AIDS virus LAV/KTLV-III.</p>
<p>One might well be tempted to reverse Gallo's original hypothesis and
to assume, that the Visna virus spontaneously changed into the AIDS
virus. Yet, so far no scientist has gone as far as that conclusion - for
a very good reason. By a coincidence - or a series of coincidences - a
genome part of 275 nucleotides from the Virna virus would have had to
change so greatly, that at least 50 per cent of them fitted to the
corresponding section of the HTLV-I genome, since it is common to the
HTLV-I and the HTLV-III, as shown above. The probability that this might
happen is 1:6 x 10<sup>82</sup>. Such an event is therefore absolutely
impossible, and corresponding results will also be obtained, if, instead
of hybridising the genomes, their nucleotide sequences are compared with
oneanother. There could not have been a coincidental, spontaneous
transition from Visna to AIDS virus.</p>
<p>The 5' end of the genome therefore originates from HTLV-I, its larger
pert with the 3'end Iron Visna virus. The whole thing is a <span
class="quote">"chimera"</span>, a system, of two components of different
origin, artificially by nature and only brought by the skills of genetic
engineering.</p>
<p>Recently the nucleotide chain of the Visna virus has been sequences
(Sonigo ez al. (21)). On that basis Stephens et al. (22) drew up a
phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses. According to this, the
LAV/HTLY-III are very closely related. A branch far remote fro; (bovine
leukemia virus) them comprises HTLV-I, HI17-II, 117 end otr.er animal
viruses. The marked vn-i-_ T T.tV/HTT.V-ITI is also demonstrated by the
phylogenetic trees drawn up independently by Chiu et al. (23),
Wayne-Hobson et al. (14), Gonaa et al. (24) and Watanabe et al. (25)
(fig.4). A spontaneous transition from the sub-family HTLV-I to the
sub-family KTLV-III/Visna must be completely excluded biologically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However I don't know if Seale, Strecker, or Segal presented the Visna
theory first. None of them seemed to credit the others as a source.</p>
<p>In August 1986, the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine
published a letter which said:
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, The excellent editorial on the AIDS virus infection by John
Seale (August 1985 JRSM, pp 613-15) has stimulated a very productive
discussion. How-ever, I would like to draw your attention to a
commentary on this paper on Moscow Radio's <span class="quote">'World
Service'</span> in English on 26 December 1985, 21.00 GMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifying the origin of a disease makes the search for a remedy
easier. Following this rule, Dr John Seale of Britain has concluded that
the AIDS virus has been artificially created and its appearance is
possibly the result of a human error. This conclusion supports the view
that the AIDS epidemic has been caused by experiments with humans
carried out in the USA as part of the development of new biological
weapons.</p>
<p>Dr Seale claims in his report that, from the viewpoint of genetic
engineering, to develop the AIDS virus artificially is not a problem,
for this it is only necessary to add one gene to the virus causing a
similar disease among sheep. There is ample evidence to believe that
such an operation has been carried out at a secret American
laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The journal also published a response to the letter by John Seale,
who wrote about the articles that were published in October and December
1985 in the Soviet journal <em>Literatnaya Gazeta</em>, and he wrote:
<span class="quote">"These Soviet articles led me to consider seriously
the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have been
man-made."</span></p>
<p>However in Seale's earlier article from August 1985, he did not yet
mention the Visna theory or even speculate that HIV would be a
bioweapon.
[<a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107688507800801</a>]
So by Seale's report, Moscow Radio probably referred to the article that
had been published in the communist newspaper <em>Morning Star</em> a
few days before the radio show.</p>

<p>In 2013 Cambridge University Press published a paper by Erhard
Geissler and Robert Hunt Sprinkle titled <span

I saved the following excerpts from the paper as notes.</p>
<p>Page 17 (Koehler refers to John Koehler, who wrote a book about the
Stasi):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his third paragraph, Koehler added this: <span class="quote">"I
spotted Segal's name in Stasi documents. ... In a 1991 interview with me
in Berlin, Segal presented himself as a die-hard Marxist, totally
incapable of accepting the demise of communist East Germany. Segal, then
eighty years old, insisted that his information on the origin of the HIV
virus [sic] was solid, and he denied having had any contact with the
Stasi. He was lying."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Segal's work was now ostensibly <span class="quote">"in press"</span>
in West Germany - and under a distinguished editor. His other 12 March
1986 transmission was not in German but in English, and it went to
Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Professor [Shingo] Shibata, our common friend Eva Brück
[according to the Center for Jewish History a Holocaust survivor and the
author of <em>Shadows of the Past: Childhood Years in Austria
1933-1938</em>] gave me the advice, to send you a paper my wife an [sic]
I just finished. It deals with the origin of AIDS and concludes, that
this disease did not originate in Central Africa and come to us via the
Green Monkey, but that the AIDS virus is a chimera from HTLV-I and visna
virus, performed by gene surgery in the P-4 laborators [sic] of Fort
Detrick, Maryland, USA, in the fall 1977.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Segals many years earlier had moved to East Berlin after the
Soviet consulate in Paris had <span class="quote">"proposed"</span> they
do so.[149] Jakob had then become an active unofficial Stasi
informer.[150] [...] Segal had been assigned to a Fübrungsoffizier - <span
class="quote">"an intelligence officer directly responsible for an
individual agent"</span>[153] named Captain Kairies. But in 1955 Segal
had been shuffled over to new direction. Captain Kairies had filed this
note: <span class="quote">"Today instructed by comrade advisor not to
have additional meetings with Segal. All actions that can be performed
by S. are to be arranged by instructor."</span>[154] The terms <span
class="quote">"comrade advisor"</span> and <span
class="quote">"instructor"</span> usually referred to officers of the
KGB responsible for maintenance of cooperation with the MfS. By 1962 the
MfS had decided to end its cooperation with Segal. Its reasons were
substantive: <span class="quote">"[H]e adopts a platform contrary to the
DAW [Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, German Academy of
Sciences at Berlin]. ... Information provided by him is very general ...
[and] the IM [the informer, Segal] is shunned by many
scientists."</span>[155]</p>

<p>Not long thereafter, on 27 January 1992, AIDS disinformation entered
its exponential phase, its disinformation-squared phase.
<em>Panorama</em>, a German television news magazine, was reporting that
the story of HIV having spread from Fort Detrick <span
class="quote">"after a geneaccident ... had been elaborated by the Russian
KGB and the Stasi, as [Colonel Dr. Rolf] Wagenbreth and his team boast
today. They also took responsibility for its world-wide
dissemination."</span>[177] When Segal had most actively been
propagating the myth, Wagenbreth had been head of Department X - the
<span class="quote">"X"</span> meaning <span class="quote">"10"</span>
of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance, HV A; thus, Wagenbreth had
been head of HV A/X. His responsibility, about which he refused to
comment during the broadcast, had been disinformation.</p>
<p>Stasi veterans, their civil liberties assured, were stepping up to
brag: to take credit, not to take blame. More soon followed, Günter
Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer most notably. Bohnsack said he had been
heac of HV A/X Section 7, <span class="quote">"Trade and
Industry,"</span>[178] but was later described as having beer
responsible for disinformation within HV A/X.!" Brehmer said he had been
responsible for Westert agencies within HV A/X Section 5, <span
class="quote">"Secret Services."</span>[178]</p>
<p>That same year, 1992, Bohnsack and Brehme published a book,
<em>Auftrag Irreführung. Wie die Stas Politik im Westen machte</em>
[<em>Mission Misleading: Hou the Stasi Made Politics in the West</em>].
<span class="quote">"The superpower [the Soviet Union] dealt the
cards,"</span> they wrote, <span class="quote">"and also took care not
to reveal its own hand. It respected the junior partner [the GDR], but
saw the appropriate balance of power at the negotiation table through
Moscow's eyes - and so the GDR shrunk back ot being a small country in
central Europe."</span> Then came five paragraphs about the myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Moscow communicated clearly when it came to the planned AIDS
campaign against the USA. The quick spread of this terrible disease to
millions of people, especially in Africa, renewed the discussion about
the origin of the virus. During this time, a number of theses and
theories were proposed; a prominent one among them was that new genetic
research undertaken in the US could have produced a deformed organism
that threatened humanity. With this background, the concept for the
campaign practically wrote itself. The campaign allowed us to tie in our
other active measures, such as our argument, launched to reach across
the world, that the United States already had experience with germ
warfare in Korea.</p>
<p>The substance of our disinformation action consisted of the following
propositions: The AIDS virus was created in a special secure virus and
gene laboratory of the military research institute in Fort Detrick
(Maryland/USA). By 1977 it had passed via experimental subjects
uncontrolled into the public sphere and had initiated the deadly
catastrophe. The USA as repository of all threats - the classic closeup
used by the East. And the HVA went all out to publicize the idea.</p>
<p>First, the East Berlin professor Jakob Segal took up this version.
Stefan Heym made sure, through an interview he conducted for the West
Berlin [daily newspaper] <em>tageszeitung (taz)</em> with the scientist,
to spread the AIDS lie in Europe, [and] journalists carried the story to
Africa and to other regions afflicted by the disease.</p>
<p>Finally, the best-selling author Johannes Mario Simmel, who was then
writing about the topic of genetic research, availed himself innocently
of the materials sent to him and adopted the details of our
construction. The corresponding passages appear in the 1987 novel
<em>Along with the Clowns Came the Tears</em>, published by Droemer
Knaur in Munich. A masterpiece of active measures, as one in the GDR
leadership circle found it to be.</p>
<p>Who contributed knowingly to disseminating this dirty story and who
deceived themselves and let themselves be used is an open question. The
subsequent General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev,
did, by the way, apologize to the United States for this
action.[105]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 29 November, Dr. Helmut Theodor, a highranking staffer at the GDR
Ministry of Health, noted that Samuel Mitja Rapoport, Professor of
Biochemistry at Humboldt University and a leading communist health
politician as well as Segal's colleague and close friend, had proposed
<span class="quote">"to publish in the daily news a paper on AIDS.
Objective: The AIDS agent has been manipulated and has escaped from an
American laboratory (biological weapons)."</span>[197] Referring to
reports about the presence of antibodies against the AIDS agent in sera
taken in Africa between 1960 and 1965 - and presumably also because his
superior, Health Minister Professor Ludwig Mecklinger, had decided
already by early 1984 not to deal with the AIDS problem in public[298] -
Theodor rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>This story is a little strange, since Rapoport never dealt with the
HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth in any of his numerous publications. He might
have realized soon that the myth was totally unfounded.[198] Or Theodor
might not have been informed correctly. Perhaps the proposal came not
from Rapoport but from Segal. Documents available to us are silent on
this question.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1985, three days after Theodor's rejection of the
putative Rapoport proposal, Segal wrote to Müller-Hill, mentioning a
suspicion raised primarily <span class="quote">"in the Indian newspaper
Citizen [sic] and"</span> secondarily in <em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em>
that the AIDS agent had been assembled, through genetic engineering, to
be a biological weapon.[104] Neither of the Segals was to mention either
article in any published work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Samuel Mitja Rapoport says: <span
class="quote">"Of Jewish descent and a committed communist, he fled
Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany, and moved to the United
States. In 1950, as a result of an investigation of un-American
activities, he was offered a professorship in East Berlin."</span>

<p>Jakob Segal was just an <span class="quote">"IM,"</span> an
<em>inoffizieller Mitarbeiter</em> or <span class="quote">"unofficial
collaborator,"</span> an informer for the Ministry for State Security -
one of approximately 180,000 IMs reporting to the MfS.[230,231] Whether
he was actively informing in the mid-1980s we do not know. Lilli,
however, did report to the MfS at least twice on the interest of the US
Embassy in East Berlin in Jakob's activities.[81,116] No document
reveals whether she was asked to provide such reports or provided them
conscientiously - or prudentially.</p>
<p>In one document dealing with the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth, Colonel
Oldenburg, deputy head of Department IX/C of the HV A, mentioned that
Segal and his wife <span class="quote">"are registered by HV

could not have related to AIDS. Moreover, responsibilities of the

<blockquote>
<p>Soon, though, readers would see Segal himself defending his claims
eloquently in an interview published 18 February 1987 in West Berlin in
the daily newspaper <em>tageszeitung</em> (<em>taz</em>).[86]</p>
<p>The interview was performed and published by Stefan Heym (1913-2001),
a widely admired journalist and public intellectual. In 1933, Helmut
Flieg, a German Jew, fled to Czechoslovakia, becoming Stefan Heym. In
1935, he moved on to the United States, where he attended the University
of Chicago and became an American citizen. In 1943 Heym joined a
psychological-warfare unit of the US Army and the next year took part in
the Normandy landings; these experiences formed the background for one
of his best known novels, <em>The Crusaders</em>. Protesting the Korean
War, Heym in 1951 returned all his American military decorations and
left the US for Prague, Czechoslovakia, and in 1952 for East Berlin,
where he became famous as a writer and dissident, his pseudonym by then
a pen name. Although steadfastly a socialist, Heym published articles
and books sharply critical of the politically repressive behaviors of
Soviet-bloc leaders, including leaders in the GDR. Much of his work
could be published only in the West, and Heym was observed and harassed
by the Stasi intensely.[321,322,323,324] Not least because of harassment
itself, Heym's publications found broad interest in both Germanies and
abroad, and attention to the Segal interview was widespread. In
following issues the <em>taz</em> published numerous received comments,
many of which were later compiled by Kuno Kruse in his book <em>AIDS -
Pathogens from a Gene Laboratory?</em>[243]</p>
<p>Heym became the subject of an <em>Operativer Vorgang</em> or
<em>OV</em>, an <span class="quote">"operational procedure,"</span> and
he became a victim of <em>OV Diversant</em>. The aim of <em>OV
Diversant</em> was to monitor and frustrate: <span class="quote">"by
evaluation of the manner of his connections into the NSW [non-socialist
currency area, meaning the West] to examine whether Heym acts on demand
of secret services (or) other hostile organizations of individuals [and]
to restrict his further hostile activities by appropriate politically
operative measures[.]"</span> This was all to be accomplished through
IMs - unofficial informers to the MfS - and by activities of HA XX in
cooperation with HV A, HA II, and friendly security services.[325]
(Figure 15)</p>
<p>According to Boghardt, Heym's <span class="quote">"enlistment in the
AIDS campaign was a major coup for Segal and the HVA."</span>[301] The
term <span class="quote">"enlistment"</span> suggests that Heym became a
knowing participant in disinformation, yet Boghardt and his sources have
not speculated on how the Stasi might have succeeded in recruiting one
of their most resilient victims. Boghardt has also written that <span
class="quote">"like his interviewee [Segal] he [Heym] was probably
unaware of HVA involvement.[301] The implication here is that the Stasi
controlled these two, making them act as they otherwise would not have
acted, that it controlled them so effectively, so cleverly, so subtly
that they"probably"</span> never caught on. Heym had been <span
class="quote">"enlisted"</span> subliminally. This implication is not
reconcilable with archival findings or live questioning. Actually, the
Stasi initially were aware of neither Heym's interest nor his Segal
interview. Heym's physician, Professor Doctor Dagobert Müller, had drawn
his patient's attention to an item written by Jakob Segal. [326] Heym
immediately grew fascinated by the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth. This was
9 October 1986; in his diary, unpublished but kindly provided to us by
his widow, Inge Heym, he recorded the date.[327] What was the item his
physician had? A copy of the draft paper received by Bond? A copy of the
material Segal had provided to African journalists? A Harare handout? We
know neither what it was nor how he came to have it. In June 2007, one
of us, E.G., gained access to part of Stefan Heym's estate. There, in a
box containing many AIDS-related books and articles, was nothing likely
to have been the item shown to Heym by his physician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Heym says: <span class="quote">"He was a
member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the
command of émigré Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts
designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet,
radio and loudspeaker."</span>

<p>Prominent among the Stasi's surmised successes was inducing a
venerable Austrian author to write a novel advertising the myth as

<a href=#Lilli_Segal id=Lilli_Segal>Lilli Segal</a>
</h2>
<p>A biography of Lilli Segal said:
[<a href=https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/>https://en.convoi77.org/deporte_bio/segal-lilli/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His second wife, Edith Albrecht, threatened to denounce Lilli to the
police as a communist, to make her leave the shared residence. Because
of the tightening restrictions for Jews in Germany, Lilli moved to
France in 1933 and studied at the Toulouse University of
Agriculture.</p>
<p>During her stay in Toulouse she met the student Jakob Segal, a
Lithuanian national, who was a member of the German Communist Party
(KPD). He had immigrated to France because of his involvement in the
communist <span class="quote">'Red Student Union'</span>. They married
on May 25, 1935 and Lilli was given Lithuanian citizenship by virtue of
the marriage, which made her a citizen of the Soviet Union from
1940.</p>
<p>Due to her non-German nationality, Lilli Segal was able to travel to
Germany without any difficulties after 1935. During these trips she took
on several missions for the KPD without being a member of the party.
These were among other things the housing of endangered comrades, the
production and distribution of leaflets, and courier activities. In
addition, she remained in contact with a group of Bavarian Catholic
officers who were opponents of the Hitler regime. They provided her with
money for political work.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of war, Lilli Segal worked in a laboratory in
Paris from 1937. She joined the French Communist Party, with which she
was regularly involved until the beginning of the war. Because they
feared that she was under surveillance by the Gestapo, the French
comrades broke off the connection with her.</p>
<p>When Germany occupied France, she left Paris and lived in Mende. In
the summer of 1943 party leaders decided to transfer Lilli Segal to the
same working group as her husband, because both had lived together for a
long time and worked in the same office.</p>
<p>From 1943 until her arrest she worked as a so-called liaison agent
for her husband, who worked at the technical headquarters of a party
section which dealt with transporting materials, as well as the contact
management of liaisons with the headquarters.</p>
<p>The persecution of party official Paul Grasse led the police to their
office in the summer of 1943. With the arrest of a number of German and
Austrian party comrades on November 23rd Paul Grasse also
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lilli Segal was also questioned by the French police (see picture
above) at the Prefecture de Police. She was not cooperative and was
arrested as a result. After a month, she was handed over by the French
police to the German run jail of Fresnes., where she remained until the
end of June 1944.</p>
<p>At the end of June, she was taken t Drancy, and after a month, on 31
July 1944, Lilli Segal was deported to Auschwitz in Convoi 77. In the
train, she made contact with two Austrian comrades; one of them was Anni
Sussmann, with whom she was transferred in November 1944 to a Labour
unit at Kratzau in the Sudetenland. (1)</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>After returning to France, Lilli Segal continued working for the
French Communist Party until 1947. (5) Since it became prohibited for
Soviet citizens to work for a political party abroad, she left France
together with her husband, Jakob Segal, and they emigrated to the German
Democratic Republic. From 1948 she worked in the GDR in various official
political organizations, e.g. as an interpreter. (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper said:
<span class="quote">"The Segals had both become Soviet citizens
following the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania in 1940, and in
autumn 1952, as Lilli later wrote, <span class="quote">'they had been
asked to see the Soviet consulate [in Paris]. The consul proposed to us
that we move to Berlin, in the German Democratic Republic.'</span>[75]
They accepted the consul's proposal, in late December 1952 going to
Humboldt University, East Berlin."</span>
[<a href=f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf>f/Geissler_Sprinkle_Disinformation_squared.pdf</a>]
But the biography I quoted above said that the Segals moved to the GDR
in 1948 and not 1952.</p>
<p>The <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jakob and Lilli were both biologists, but they were also both Jews
and communists and partisans of the French resistance. In Paris on 21
November 1943, Lilli was arrested by Vichy French police and
interrogated over several weeks. On 20 December she was transferred to
German authorities and spent the next eight months in a Wehrmacht prison
nearby in Fresnes. In August 1944, with Allied armies threatening from
the west and the south, Lilli was deported. After four days on a train
she arrived at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland.[72] Lilli was an
inmate there while anthropologist-physician Josef Mengele, <span
class="quote">"Der Todesengel [the Death Angel],"</span> was conducting
inhumane experiments - on twins when he could get them. Mengele sorted
arriving prisoners, sending most to die, selecting some as workers,
others as subjects. He selected Lilli. <span class="quote">"Someone
shouted: <span class="quote">'Old people and mothers with kids to the
left, women to the right [Alte und Frauen mit Kindern links, Frauen
rechts].'</span> ... It was Dr. Mengele. ... The majority of us were killed
immediately after arrival by gas, including 300 kids from an
orphanage."</span>[73] In November 1944, after a second selection by
Mengele, Lilli was transferred to a slave-labor camp near Zittau, in
Saxony, to manufacture aircraft parts. From Zittau on 20 November 1944
she escaped. Lilli made her way to Switzerland and then in March 1945 to
a liberated Paris.[74]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lilli Segal may have also produced disinformation about the Holocaust
and not only HIV. A common trope among Auschwitz survivors is that they
claim they were personally selected by Josef Mengele when they arrived
to Auschwitz. In the primary mainstream biography of Mengele, David
Marwell wrote: <span class="quote">"There are some who recall a
confrontation with Mengele but are mistaken, having confused him with
another SS doctor or simply having assumed it must have been Mengele who
carried out the monstrous deed that left them alive while taking so many
they loved. Historian Zdenek Zofka notes that many survivors recall
Mengele speaking to them in Hungarian, a language he did not speak but
which was spoken by his colleagues, the pharmacist Viktor Capesius and
the physician Dr. Fritz Klein. Often Mengele would be described as tall
and blond, when he was only 5ft 8½ inches tall and dark-haired.[31]
<span class="quote">'Almost all inmates'</span> at Auschwitz, according
to Zofka, maintain that they had been selected by Mengele. [...] Geoffrey
Hartmann, who wrote extensively on survivor testimony, observed that
<span class="quote">'every Auschwitz survivor seems to have gone through
a selection by Mengele, as if he manned his post 24 hours a
day.'</span>[34] In fact, Mengele took his turn at ramp duty like the
rest of the medical staff in the camp. There is no evidence that he
served there more frequently or for longer hours than his
colleagues."</span>

bounded far into conspiracy theory, raising the possibility that the
AIDS virus had been tested covertly by the CIA in Africa."</span>

Lehrman presented Duesberg's theory that HIV did not cause AIDS, but on
the other hand he also presented the theory of the Segals that HIV was a
bioweapon, and he reconciled the two theories by asking: <span
class="quote">"Might the virus then be a laboratory-created, minimally
infective agent intended to be blamed for the chemical poisoning it
actually accompanies?"</span> In the fashion of Sasha Latypova, he
proposed that AIDS was caused by some unspecified toxic substances.</p>
<p>Lehrman also wrote: <span class="quote">"The Segals' assertions, as
well as that of Dr. Seale, Dr. Strecker, this author, and others, have
received considerable attention in the international press, particularly

about Geissler and Sprinkle's follow-up paper</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2019 Geissler and Sprinkle published a follow-up paper to their
paper titled <span class="quote">"Were our critics right about the
Stasi?: AIDS disinformation and <span class="quote">'disinformation
squared'</span> after five years"</span>.
[<a href=https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/abs/were-our-critics-right-about-the-stasi/4216D41CEA8551BF569C33D46366C77F>https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/abs/were-our-critics-right-about-the-stasi/4216D41CEA8551BF569C33D46366C77F</a>]</p>
<p>They wrote that the DC Spy Museum historian Thomas Boghardt relied on
false information from the former stasi disinformation agent Günter
Bohnsack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have supported their interpretation by reference
to the former Stasi officers Bohnsack and Brehmer, who we found
untrustworthy, and by reference to Boghardt, whose confidence in
Bohnsack worked seriously against him. Notably, Boghardt's exposition of
the Segals' contacts with American diplomats - Bohnsack had persuaded
Boghardt these had been Stasi officers impersonating CIA agents
pretending to be American diplomats[29] - we proved to have been
erroneous. One of the American diplomats had gone on to become United
States Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus and kindly described to us
his Segal contacts in detail.[30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Segal finished an early draft of his thesis in January 1986, which
was after Seele had presented the Visna hypothesis in December 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No later than 3 October 1985 Segal had come to doubt the African
origin of HIV and mentioned <span class="quote">"strong indications that
AIDS evolved in the US research center for biological warfare in Fort
Detrick by genetic engineering."</span>[31] A first draft of his thesis
was ready by January 1986;[57] Segal's protégé and sometime coauthor
Ronald Dehmlow secretly shared parts of this thesis with HA VII/7, the
MfS department conducting counter-espionage at Dehmlow's place of
work.[58]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People from Stasi were opposed to Segal's hypothesis and thought it
might harm the reputation of GDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some departments of the Stasi also examined this report. An officer
of the department responsible for counter-intelligence in economic and
scientific affairs informed other departments of the MfS, including the
Regional Administration East Berlin, that <span
class="quote">"[o]fficials of the ministry of Health as well as
Humboldt-University Berlin, who deal with the AIDS problem and with
homosexuality, share the opinion that Segal's claim is not tenable from
a scientific and medical view."</span>[106] Selvage and Nehring have not
mentioned this letter.</p>
<p>Major Dewitz of the Stasi's East Berlin Administration initiated a
comprehensive evaluation of Segal's claims.[107] Dewitz, too, in a
comprehensive four-page memorandum, concluded that <span
class="quote">"all GDR experts are convinced that Prof. Segal's theory
is untenable."</span> But that was a scientific consensus. What Dewitz
described next, though, was a political consensus, that Segal's
activities <span class="quote">"are considered to be politically
harmful"</span> and that spreading the myth generated <span
class="quote">"disadvantages for the GDR"</span> - <span
class="quote">"scientific disadvantages,... economic disadvantages... and
political disadvantages."</span>[108] Consequently, the Stasi, <span
class="quote">"Shield and Sword of the Party,"</span> should not support
but rather should suppress Segal's activities. Major Dewitz went on to
contemplate measures <span class="quote">"[t]o protect the esteem of the
GDR with appropriate measures"</span> by making Segal desist.[109]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one point Segal claimed that Gallo had created HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greenwald referred to a Segal interview published in an Austrian
journal, Basta. In that interview Segal had not only g/repeated his
allegations but had also asserted that virologist Robert Gallo - along
with Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi a co-discoverer of HIV was
responsible for the creation of the AIDS agent through genetic
manipulation.[141] Later Segal explained that <span class="quote">"the
Pentagon simply purchased Gallo."</span>[142]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Segals may have been presented as French to downplay their ties
to the eastern bloc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September 1986 in <span class="quote">"Pentagon behind
AIDS?"</span> Moscow's New Times referred to <span class="quote">"French
scientists Jacob and Lily [sic] Segal."145 Later the GDR's Ministries of
Health and Foreign Affairs described Jakob Segal as French.[135,138] But
the Ministry of State Security - the MfS or Stasi - knew Segal was a
citizen of the Soviet Union. USDoS also knew this: "Throughout the early
and middle stages of the disinformation campaign, Soviet-bloc media
repeatedly misidentified Segal as a French national."</span> USDoS
assumed disinformation in <span class="quote">"an effort to downplay his
ties to the G.D.R."</span> But USDoS also suggested not disinformation
but <em>misinformation</em>: <span class="quote">"Segal, who resides in
East Berlin but claims to have graduated from the Sorbonne in 1940, has
been repeatedly misidentified as a French researcher."</span>[146]</p>
<p>Selvage and Nehring have seen here only disinformation: an attempt to
hide Segal's ties to East Berlin ties that Segal himself made patently
obvious again and again. Pretending Segal was French, Selvage and
Nehring have proposed, would have been advantageous since <span
class="quote">"AIDS disinformation spread from the East ought to be
supported by <span class="quote">'Western
scientists.'</span>"</span>[147]</p>

Boghardt's paper about Operation INFEKTION</a>
</h2>
<p>This section consists of my notes from Thomas Boghardt's paper <span
class="quote">"Operation INFEKTION: Soviet Bloc Intelligence and Its
AIDS Disinformation Campaign"</span>.
[<a href=https://digitallibrary.tsu.ge/book/2019/september/books/Soviet-Bloc-Intelligence-and-Its-AIDS.pdf>https://digitallibrary.tsu.ge/book/2019/september/books/Soviet-Bloc-Intelligence-and-Its-AIDS.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>The paper was published in a journal run by the CIA called <span
class="quote">"Studies in Intelligence"</span>. Boghardt used to serve
as the historian at the International Spy Museum in Washington DC, but
he is now a senior historian at the US Army Center of Military
History.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote: <span class="quote">"East German intelligence
routinely floated disinformation depicting West German politicians as
former Nazis, because, from East Berlin's perspective, the Federal
Republic of Germany was merely an incarnation of the Third
Reich."</span></p>
<p>It reminded me of the radio show of Dave Emory, who found Nazis
hiding under every rock, and who claimed that Western countries were
covertly controlled by the <span class="quote">"underground
Reich"</span> or the <span class="quote">"Bormann network"</span>. Dave
Emory did several radio shows about the theory that HIV was an American
bioweapon, and he had Len Horowitz and Alan Cantwell as guests on his
show.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote: <span class=quote>"The campaign reopened with an
article in the newspaper _Lit eraturnaya Gazeta, the KGB's <span
class="quote">'prime conduit in the Soviet press for propaganda and
disinformation.'</span>[38]"</span></p>
<p>The source he cited was the Soviet defector Oleg Kalunin's book <span
class="quote">"The First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and
Espionage against the West"</span>. Kalunin wrote: <span
class="quote">"In all the years I was in Foreign Counterintelligence,
<em>Literaturnaya Gazeta</em> was our prime conduit in the Soviet press
for propaganda and disinformation. Whenever we called the editor,
Alexander Chakovsky, and asked him to print an article, he complied.
Sometimes we wrote the stories and put them under the names of
nonexistent authors. Sometimes journalists such as Borovik or Iona
Andronov wrote the stories themselves, using information supplied by the
KGB."</span>

<p>Boghardt wrote: <span class="quote">"The East Germans were told
specifically to employ a <span class="quote">'scientific
approach'</span>[42] and produce disinformation contending the AIDS
virus had been developed at Fort Detrick, from where it spread to the
general population through human testing. Beyond those obligatory
details, the East Germans were given a free hand in devising their own
strategy and spreading the story. The HVA code named the operation
INFEKTION and VORWÄRTS II [Forward II] and henceforth was the KGB's
junior partner and main ally regarding AIDS.[43]"</span></p>
<p>His sources were Bohnsack's book and Bohnsack's letters to him.
Bohnsack is a former Stasi disinformation officer, who wrote a book
about the Stasi titled <span class="quote">"Auftrag: Irreführung. Wie
die Stasi Politik im Westen machte"</span>. The book has not been
translated to English, and I didn't find it at Anna's Archive. Geissler
wrote that he found Bohnsack to be an untrustworthy source.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote: <span class="quote">"The HVA's biggest coup was yet
to come. In the mid-1980s, the Austrian-born best-selling author
Johannes Mario Simmel mulled over a book project on the perils of
genetic manipulation and biological warfare. By that time, Simmel had
already authored 20 novels, numerous screenplays, and various short
stories and children's books. His works had been translated into 25
languages and sold over 65 million copies. By sheer coincidence, HVA
Department III (electronic surveillance) recorded a phone conversation
referencing Simmel's project and forwarded a copy to Department X. The
disinformation specialists spotted an opportunity and decided to
anonymously send Simmel material pertaining to Segal's AIDS
theory.[71]"</span> The source he cited was the book <span
class="quote">"Kundschafter a.D.: Das Ende der DDR-Spionage"</span> by
Klaus Behling.</p>
<p>He also wrote: <span class="quote">"Raving about his agency's coup,
Markus Wolf proudly piled 10 copies of Simmel's novel on his desk.
Bohnsack and his colleagues were both happy and surprised that Simmel
accepted the HVA material as genuine and made such extensive use of
it.[73]"</span> He cited Bohnsack's letter to himself as a source.</p>
<p>In the <span class="quote">"Disinformation squared"</span> paper,
Geissler and Sprinkle wrote: <span class="quote">"Further, the claim
that <span class="quote">'HVA X had provided Segal with much of the
material for his pamphlet'</span>[183] is not supported by documentary
proof; it relies instead on Boghardt's personal communications with
Behling and former Stasi officer Bohnsack. The MfS could hardly have
provided Segal with background papers since it learned about the
spreading of the myth first in September 1986 from foreign press reports
and its own surveillance of US diplomats' activities."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 1987, HVA X gave Segal material <span class="quote">"from
secret service circles"</span> on the 1969 congressional testimony of
Donald MacArthur, then deputy director of research and engineering in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In his testimony, MacArthur
stated that <span class="quote">"within a period of five to 10 years it
would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have
been acquired."</span> He elaborated further that <span class="quote">"A
research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed
in approximately five years at a total cost of $10
million."</span>[100]</p>
<p>For Segal, the MacArthur testimony was near-certain evidence that the
Pentagon had not only contemplated an HIVtype virus since 1969 but also
had gone through with the project within the 10-year time frame
MacArthur had suggested. Henceforth, MacArthur's testimony became a
cornerstone of Segal's conspiracy theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacArthur's testimony is frequently also quoted by Nick the
Spacecat.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boghardt wrote that Segal later started to blame Gallo for creating
the virus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his earlier publications and utterances, Segal had dispassionately
and largely accurately described Gallo's contribution to the
identification of HIV, but he sharply changed his tack in the late
1980s, when Gallo became the key figure in Segal's theory. In his final
years, Segal developed an apparent pathological hatred of Gallo as the
man personally responsible for creating AIDS, and he seized every
opportunity to lambast the American scientist.</p>
<p>In 1989, just one year before East Germany's demise, Segal went on a
lecture tour across West Germany. Even though the SED leadership had
avoided endorsing Segal and he did not travel as an official GDR
representative, his trip was inconceivable without the Politburo's
knowledge and approval. In his presentations, Segal touted his latest
piece of evidence - the MacArthur hearing of 1969 - and pilloried
Gallo.103 According to the recollections of one of his listeners, Segal
referred to Gallo as <span class="quote">"a huge gangster"</span> [ein
ganz grosser Gangster] who was responsible for creating the
virus.[104]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Segal's last major accomplishment during the Cold War was the
publication in 1990 of his book <em>AIDS - die Spur führt ins
Pentagon</em> [<em>AIDS - the trail leads to the Pentagon</em>], which
incorporated the bits on Gallo and the MacArthur hearing into his
original thesis. The book was published by <em>Neuer Weg</em>, a
publishing house closely associated with the far-left, Maoist Marxist
Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD).</p>
