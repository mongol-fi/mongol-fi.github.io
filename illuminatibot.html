<a href=#Initial_research_on_the_illuminatibot_account id=Initial_research_on_the_illuminatibot_account>Initial research on the illuminatibot account</a>
</h2>
<p>While I was researching Twitter bots that promoted content from controlled alternative media, one of the first accounts I looked into was called iluminatibot, because it has over a million followers, and for some reason it was followed by many real people who I followed on Twitter even though it was overtly presented as a bot.</p>
<p>I found that the account was part of a network of bots that is connected to the IlluminatiCoin cryptocurrency: [<a href=https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin>https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-illuminatilinktree.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The <a href=https://x.com/iluminatibot>iluminatibot</a> account was created in 2015, but its oldest tweet was posted in 2016, and it features a quote with a Guy Fawkes mask and the Anonymous logo in the bottom corner. The second-oldest tweet is dated November 2019, and it consists of an image of a pyramid with the text <span class="quote">"What IS The OCCULT?"</span> and a definition of occultism. Other early tweets by the account consist of a balanced mixture of the kind of random images that might be returned on Google Images if you search for <span class="quote">"illuminati"</span> and other topics that are conceptually one or two jumps away from the topic of illuminati, and also links to YouTube videos about the same kind of topics, and random text-only tweets that consist of factoids like this: <span class="quote">"The Trilateral Commission was established in 1973. Its founder and primary financial angel was international financier, David Rockefeller."</span> When I searched for the the text of some of the text-only factoid tweets, I found that they had also been posted by accounts with usernames like <a href=https://x.com/0ccultbot>0ccultbot</a>, <a href=https://x.com/AquarianStelium>AquarianStelium</a>, <a href=https://x.com/ConsentNo>ConsentNo</a>, <a href=https://x.com/conspiracyb0t>conspiracyb0t</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Esoteric_Poet>Esoteric_Poet</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Fisica_Geral>Fisica_Geral</a>, <a href=https://x.com/FORTUNATECULT>FORTUNATECULT</a>, <a href=https://x.com/imhyali>imhyali</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Lei_Eleitoral>Lei_Eleitoral</a>, <a href=https://x.com/naticoineth>naticoineth</a>, <a href=https://x.com/ProfaCoruja>ProfaCoruja</a>, <a href=https://x.com/QueenOfSecrets>QueenOfSecrets</a>, <a href=https://x.com/redpillb0t>redpillb0t</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Renemendoza322>Renemendoza322</a>, <a href=https://x.com/tetramabot>tetramabot</a>, <a href=https://x.com/thehackerb0t>thehackerb0t</a>, <a href=https://x.com/thekarak>thekarak</a>, and <a href=https://x.com/VMastery>VMastery</a> . Many of the accounts were not overtly presented as bots, so the IlluminatiCoin botnet probably extends further than just the handful of accounts that are listed on their Linktree page. (Or more likely the IlluminatiCoin bots are just a branch of a bigger botnet that also includes bots that post about other topics.)</p>
<p>iluminatibot posted the Amazon affiliate link below. When I searched for a part of the text of the tweet in double quotes, similar tweets had been posted 25 times by iluminatibot, 13 times by thehackerb0t, 13 times by 0ccultbot, 8 times by conspiracyb0t, 7 times by redpillb0t, 2 times by VMastery, 2 times by ProfaCoruja, and once each by naticoineth, imhyali, and envylords (even though sometimes the tweets didn't include the affiliate link or they had a different image). [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Lectures+on+Ancient+Philosophy+is+the+follow+up+book+to%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Lectures+on+Ancient+Philosophy+is+the+follow+up+book+to%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>Illuminaticoin has Telegram channels in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean, which is reminiscent of how content by Miles Guo is translated to various foreign languages. One of the bots which posts the same factoid-type tweets as iluminaticoin is <a href=https://x.com/Renemendoza322>Renemendoza322</a> which primarily posts in Spanish, and another one is <a href=https://x.com/Fisica_Geral>Fisica_Geral</a> which primarily posts in Portuguese.</p>
<p>When I searched for the text of one of the factoid-style tweets by iluminatibot which happened to be about Muslims, I found that it had been posted by bots that pretended to be Muslims:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-muslim.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>IlluminatiCoin network also has accounts on Instagram. One of them is called retro1uparmy, whose posts consist of a mixture of photos of luxury watches and illuminati-style images. Its bio has links to the profiles of other similar Instagram accounts called illuminaticoin.io and owltradingbot.io: [<a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CyBd7DRLGMV/>https://www.instagram.com/p/CyBd7DRLGMV/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-instagram.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>On the website of owltradingbot.io, their address is shown as <span class="quote">"OWL Investment Consulting - FZCO, Dubai Silicon Oasis, DDP, Building A1, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"</span>. [<a href=https://owltradingbot.io/>https://owltradingbot.io/</a>] The location of the owltradingbot account on Twitter is also set as Dubai. [<a href=https://x.com/owltradingbot>https://x.com/owltradingbot</a>]</p>
<p>illuminatibot has promoted Stew ops about hydras, graphene nanobots, hydrogel, and kalamari clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-stewop.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Iluminatibot seems to often post links to articles by The People's Voice, like the article about the kalamari clots shown above. The People's Voice was founded by Sean Adl-Tabatabai who previously worked for mainstream media and his gay husband: <span class="quote">"The site was founded as Your News Wire in 2014 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai and his husband, Sinclair Treadway. [...] Regular contributors to NewsPunch include Adl-Tabatabai, a former BBC and MTV employee from London previously an employee of conspiracy theorist David Icke,[16] Adl-Tabatabai's mother Carol Adl, an alternative health practitioner, and Baxter Dmitry, who had previously been posing as an unrelated Latvian man using a stolen profile photo.[17][18]"</span> [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Voice_%28website%29>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Voice_%28website%29</a>] Sean Adl-Tabatabai used to be a webmaster of David Icke's website, he produced some of David Icke's movies, and in 2014 he founded a short-lived TV channel called The People's Voice TV with David Icke. But David Icke previously also worked for BBC like Adl-Tabatabai.</p>
<p>When Liz Churchill tweeted an image of an article by The People's Voice, someone in the comments pointed out that Liz Churchill, Anastasia Maria Loupis, and illuminatibot were always posting articles from The People's Voice:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-illuminati-people.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Alex Jones posts a huge number of retweets of iluminatibot. iluminatibot also posted an Amazon affiliate link to a book by Alex Jones, but the first account which posted a tweet with the same text was thehackerb0t, and I didn't find the text of the tweet mentioned anywhere else outside Twitter:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-alexbook.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>When illuminatibot was followed by Elon Musk for a while, it posted two tweets where it mentioned how it was followed by Elon which seemed like they might have been written by a human, so maybe illuminatibot could also be a hybrid between a bot and a manually-ran account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-iluminatielon.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>In two of the tweets above where iluminatibot mentioned that it was followed by Elon Musk, it used the word <span class="quote">"lol"</span>. When I tried searching for <code>from:iluminatibot lol</code>, I found other tweets which seemed like they might be human-written and which weren't posted multiple times by different bot accounts. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Ailuminatibot+lol&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Ailuminatibot+lol&amp;f=live</a>] One of the tweets said <span class="quote">"all the accounts i follow are me as well lol"</span> and another tweet said <span class="quote">"all the twitter pages i follow are also me lol"</span>. The other tweet had also been posted by redpillbot but I didn't find any other accounts which had posted either of the tweets (so the tweet might have still been automated, even though it could be that the people who are running these bots manually entered it into the pool of tweets which gets tweeted by these bots).</p>
<p>An account called <a href=https://x.com/33isprogrammed>33isprogrammed</a> (We are NATI) does Twitter spaces about Illuminaticoin. Most of its tweets are retweets of tweets by the illuminati bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-iluminatispace.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I searched for the text of a tweet by conspiracyb0t in double quotes, the previous user who had posted the same tweet was called mikeyp920. Its most recent tweets included a bunch of quote tweets or retweets by accounts in the iluminatibot network, but they also included tweets about flat earth by accounts like nikola 3. So even though the iluminatibot network overtly consists of only a couple of accounts, the same botnet probably also includes accounts like mikeyp920 which portay real people:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-mikeyp.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>There's many other accounts which are portrayed as accounts of real people but which post tweets from the same pool of tweets that are posted by the Illuminati bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-paki.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>One of the accounts shown in the screenshot above is JournalistNimra, which posts tweets in multiple languages like Miles Guo's bots. It has also retweeted many tweets by the illuminati bots, and by accounts like Peter Sweden that are promoted by bots which also promote the illuminati bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-paki-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>IlluminatiCoin also has a Medium blog where there's an article titled <span class="quote">"Unveiling the Truther Conspiracy: The Enigmatic Figure Behind IlluminatiCoin"</span>. [<a href=https://medium.com/%40illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e>https://medium.com/%40illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e</a>] In the article the mysterious person who is supposed to have made the bots is called <span class="quote">"the Truther"</span>, but I don't know if there's actually any single person running the bots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He seems to be in an active cyber and information war with the US intelligence agencies; the NSA and the CIA, and he is always watching them and aware of their activities... What qualifications could this man possess? His posts indicate he has a PHD in cryptography and he is a potential network engineer. A PHD in cryptography might explain how he devised such complex and unbreakable NATI puzzles.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>A man of many talents and immense knowledge; could Truther be a government covert agent trained by the NSA? Furthermore, could Truther's pages on Twitter be a federal government psyop? Truther states in his posts that "The NSA is the largest employer of mathematicians in the United States, and possibly the world", yet the NSA is also constantly on the hunt for intelligent cryptographers too, cryptography and the NSA go hand in hand. Could he be an NSA employee acting out an operation relating the the revelation of the method? Could his entire Twitter operation just be a method of revealing breadcrumbs of truth through the revelation of the method? A common strategy of the Cabal too. Is Truther a Cabal member? Not only an elite hacker but someone considered apart of the elite. His vast knowledge of the occult could indicate his membership of the Illuminati.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But next it turns from a QAnon cabal LARP and Cicada cryptography LARP to a GAIA LARP, because it says that the Truther owns a spaceship and it starts talking about the Galactic Federation and the Great Awakening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He even claims to own a spaceship which he claims is a <span class="quote">"Dodge"</span> and that he is in space <span class="quote">"avoiding all the toxins"</span>. Could Truther be a delegation or emissary sent by the Galactic Federation to assist humanity?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Truther is an enigmatic mysterious figure of the modern age, a mysterious figure ushering in the new dawn, a golden age of the Great Awakening of humanity and an era of truth and freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However in the case that the article was written by AI, it could've just made up a story about who the Truther was, and some characteristics which are attributed to the Truther in the Medium post are not necessarily part of his canonical identity.</p>
<p>The account 33isprogrammed has done Twitter spaces about IlluminatiCoin. In April 2024 it announced that <span class="quote">"the Truther"</span> had stepped down as the head of the IlluminatiCoin project because he had suffered an assassination attempt, but it seems likely that the story was made up: [<a href=https://x.com/33isprogrammed/status/1782256789980852724>https://x.com/33isprogrammed/status/1782256789980852724</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's rumored that our creator <span class="citation" data-cites="iluminatibot">@iluminatibot</span> was attacked by an <span class="quote">"unknown"</span> source after launching $NATI the ERC20 token on Friday the 13th October 2023.</p>
<p>His tires were replaced with bald tires while he was on a road trip with his family. During a rain storm on his way home his vehicle hydroplaned and flipped 5-7 times in the ditch.</p>
<p>Fortunately nobody was hurt. Truther then decided it was best for his family if he stepped down from the project selling his portion of tokens.</p>
<p>The powers to be don't want $NATI or Truther to be running the project as the truth is to dangerous for them. #NATI is building a community of truthers who do not conform with the limitations placed on humanity based on ancient black magick rituals.</p>
<p>IDC, the truth is worth it and the project will continue with out without Truther at the mantel. Molesting children is not right and the truth must be exposed for humanity to transform into the Advanced Space Race Civilization we were designed to be.</p>
<p>Although we would love to have Truther back as his knowledge on the <span class="quote">"conspiracy"</span> topics are among the top rankings, WE ARE NATI, and the project will continue.</p>

</h2>
<p>On IlluminatiCoin's Medium blog the operation that runs their bots was called the <span class="quote">"Trutherbot operation"</span>. [<a href=https://medium.com/%40illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e>https://medium.com/%40illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e</a>] When I searched Twitter for the keyword <span class="quote">"trutherbot"</span>, I found this old thread from the year 2018 by a user called Conspirador Norteño: [<a href=https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1009624297806225408>https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1009624297806225408</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the process of researching various suspicious Twitter accounts, a new dodgy <span class="quote">"news"</span> site turned up on the proverbial radar - nodisinfo(dot)net. Spoiler alert - the name is not an accurate description of the content.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>This chart shows the frequency of various terms in tweets linking to nodisinfo(dot)net from a sample of 1487 accounts (probably should have gone for one more). The overarching theme: everything from chemical attacks in Syria to school shootings to 9/11 is a false flag.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>What else do the accounts that link to nodisinfo(dot)net tweet about? The <span class="quote">"deep state"</span> category is quite popular; the interest in Crimea and Ukraine in 2014 is notable.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-3.png width=600>
</div>
<p>What other news sites do accounts that link to nodisinfo(dot)net link in their tweets? The number one destination is Russia Today, and rounding out the menagerie are a variety of right wing conspiracy-oriented sites, along with Sputnik News.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-4.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Bots don't appear to be a major portion of the accounts linking to nodisinfo(dot)net, but they're far from nonexistent. 52 of the accounts in the sample of 1487 tweet 24/7, post 90+% of their tweets via an automation service such as IFTTT, or both.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-5.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>One set of accounts in the previous tweet stands out - there are several bots with the naming scheme <span class="quote">"trutherbox(X)"</span>. Seven showed up in the nodisinfo(dot)net set; digging around turns up at least six more. They've been dormant for months, but let's take a look anyway.</p>
<p>The trutherbot accounts unsurprisingly post a lot of tweets that are repeated across several of the accounts. The repeated tweet about being a bot is kinda funny; some of the others are less humorous.</p>
<p width="000">
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-6.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-7.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-8.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-9.jpg width=400>
</p>
<p>The tweet schedules for the trutherbots are very similar. They are all 24/7 accounts, and they tend to have similar gaps in activity as well, with some variance.</p>
<p width="000">
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-10.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-11.jpg width=1000>
</p>
<p>Most of the trutherbots post tweets at 15 minute intervals or multiples thereof. The sole exception is <span class="citation" data-cites="trutherbotnet">@trutherbotnet</span>, which seems to aggregate tweets from the others via IFTTT (the other 12 tweet via custom apps with the same name as the account in question.)</p>
<p width="000">

</p>
<p>What do the trutherbots tweet? Mostly memes, with <span class="quote">"deep state"</span> material in second place. These charts show some examples of the common terms - one includes a category for the memes to demonstrate the relative proportion. The others shows tweet topics with the meme tweets removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first account was <span class="citation" data-cites="trutherbot">@trutherbot</span>, which was active from Jan 2012 to July 2015, when it was suspended. The tweets visible on Internet Archive are a mix of memes, conspiracy theories, and requests for bitcoin. A number of other trutherbots were created following the suspension.</p>

<p>It's interesting that trutherbot had a Guy Fawkes avatar, because many of the accounts that are followed by two or more IlluminatiCoin bots also have a Guy Fawkes avatar, like Anonyphant, three_cube, PrayOrSomething, and anonymousgum.

<p>When I searched for the text of a tweet by Illuminatibot in double quotes, I found that it had been posted by an account called <a href=https://x.com/trutherbotlight>trutherbotlight</a> which had a Guy Fawkes avatar like the old accounts with usernames like <span class="quote">"trutherbotpink"</span> and <span class="quote">"trutherbotgreen"</span>, but for some reason it hadn't been deleted like the other trutherbot accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The trutherbotlight account stopped tweeting in 2020. Its followers also included accounts that had Guy Fawkes avatars called <a href=https://x.com/trutherbotsamur>trutherbotsamur</a> which stopped tweeting in 2023 and <a href=https://x.com/TrutherbotRG>TrutherbotRG</a> which stopped tweeting in 2019.</p>
<p>When I counted how many times TrutherbotRG had reposted each account, I noticed that there's still many other accounts whose name starts with <span class="quote">"trutherbot"</span> that had't been deleted. The account with most reposts was Kim Dotcom:</p>

<p>The tweet below by trutherbotdank seems like it was written by a human, but it was a reply to PrayOrSomething which is followed by 3 of the main IlluminatiCoin bots: [<a href=https://x.com/trutherbotdank/status/1143905390855409664>https://x.com/trutherbotdank/status/1143905390855409664</a>]</p>

<p>The location of <a href=https://x.com/trutherbotadmin>trutherbotadmin</a> is set as <span class="quote">"Γαλακτική οδός"</span> which means Milky Way in Greek. It's interesting because many of the small accounts that are followed by multiple IlluminatiCoin bots portray Greek people or they have Greek text in their bio (like CHRIS18703, MICHAILA41108, AthinaKilia, and DimitriosKilias, which are connected to fake accounts of UFO-related people and fake accounts of a few YouTube channels):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight-2.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The bio of trutherbotadmin linked to the website trutherbot.com, which seems to have been a blog that mostly contained videos about different conspiracy topics: [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/>https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight-3.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>The website even had a forum, but there's only one snapshot at web.archive.org for the index of the forum. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/>https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/</a>] The snapshot shows that usernames of users on the forum included Max Dewald, The Dude, Secure Lemons, myg0t, bert, THCris, Patonplace, trutherbot, BADM0T0RF1NGER, Gonzo710, ThirdEyeTruth, Secure Lemons, and anonymoose:</p>

<p>Most of the trutherbot accounts seem to have stopped tweeting by 2023 or earlier. I didn't find any of the trutherbot accounts using the hashtag #Trutherbot after 2023 either. [<a href=https://x.com/hashtag/Trutherbot>https://x.com/hashtag/Trutherbot</a>]</p>
<p>Many of the trutherbot accounts also used the hashtag #Trutherbotarmy, but the latest tweets with the hashtag were all posted by the account <a href=https://x.com/naticoineth>naticoineth</a> which hosts Twitter spaces about IlluminatiCoin. [<a href=https://x.com/hashtag/trutherbotarmy?f=live>https://x.com/hashtag/trutherbotarmy?f=live</a>] Another interesting tweet with the hashtag was posted by a user called <a href=https://x.com/yruidjits>yruidjits</a>, who posted an image which said that <span class="quote">"#TrutherBotArmy is a splinter group of #Anonymous"</span>, but he has also been featured in the IlluminatiCoin spaces:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight-5.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The bio of yruidjits links to this Telegram channel: <a href=https://t.me/truth3rb0tnet.><a href="https://t.me/truth3rb0tnet" class="uri">https://t.me/truth3rb0tnet</a>.</a> In a Reddit thread where someone asked what happened to trutherbot, a user called yruidjits posted links to the accounts quot3bot and drugb0t (which have both now also been suspended). [<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/ccq6bg/what_happened_to_trutherbot/>https://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/ccq6bg/what_happened_to_trutherbot/</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>At the top of IlluminatiCoin's Linktree page there's a link labeled <span class="quote">"Operation Q"</span>: [<a href=https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin>https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-operationq-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The link goes to the page <a href=https://link-tube.com/OperationQ>link-tube.com/OperationQ</a> which mostly consists of links to a Q blog called Humorous Mathematics: [<a href=https://www.humorousmathematics.com>https://www.humorousmathematics.com</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-operationq-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The newest post in the blog is dated November 2023 and the oldest post is from 2020, and many of the links on the link-tube page also go to old posts from 2020.</p>
<p>The about page of the blog mentions three staff members, who are founder Chris Deluge, co-founder Josh Alexandria, and managing editor Operation Q. Below Operation Q's name there is a link to the same link-tube.com page that was linked by IlluminatiCoin, so maybe Operation Q is one of the people who runs the IlluminatiCoin bots, or maybe there's a team of people that is hiding behind the moniker (which I suspect is the case with Vigilant Fox who is supposed to be the editor-in-chief of Vigilant News, even though the Humorous Mathematics blog seems like a small enough operation that it could be ran by even a single person and not three people, and Operation Q was also featured in some episodes of the Humorous Mathematics podcast along with the other two guys):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-operationq-3.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>There were only 8 results when I googled for a combination of the names Chris Deluge and Josh Alexandria in double quotes, but half of the results were about episodes of the Humorous Mathematics podcast. The podcast used to be hosted at Anchor.fm and several other platforms, but it now seems to have been deleted from all platforms. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20210328223249/https://anchor.fm/humorousmathematics>http://web.archive.org/web/20210328223249/https://anchor.fm/humorousmathematics</a>] The description of the podcast said <span class="quote">"Dallas based coincidence theorists, The Humorous Mathematicians, discuss current events and topics revolving around the current state of America, Qanon, child trafficking, the Deep State and other dark forces. WWG1WGA"</span></p>
<p>Episodes of the podcast have also been posted on archive.org but their audio files are now private. [<a href=https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Humorous+Mathematics%22>https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Humorous+Mathematics%22</a>] There's a total of 27 episodes of the podcast at archive.org, but I found only five episodes which featured a guest. One of the guests was the <span class="quote">"former CIA Officer Brandon Blackburn"</span>. Another guest was someone called Vinctum from the Netherlands, who used to have a YouTube channel about Q but the old videos on his channel have now been deleted and it now just has videos of inspirational music with anime thumbnails. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200420162226/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZ_FipjV1hrExi9uDWesGA>http://web.archive.org/web/20200420162226/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZ_FipjV1hrExi9uDWesGA</a>] The three other guests were people called <span class="quote">"Sophia Raw"</span>, <span class="quote">"Witsup"</span>, and <span class="quote">"Denton, Tx Local Hip Hop Artist and Community Activist, AV the Great"</span>. The only episodes of the podcast I found that were still online were two episodes that were posted to YouTube, where in the other episode their guest was the former CIA officer. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aYhTBDTRK4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aYhTBDTRK4</a>]</p>
<p>Even though the IlluminatiCoin bots don't generally promote flat earth, Operation Q wrote a post for Humorous Mathematics titled <span class="quote">"The Earth Is Flat &amp; Stationary: Destroying The Freemasonic Luciferian Globalist <span class="quote">'Globe'</span> Lie"</span>: [<a href=https://www.humorousmathematics.com/post/the-earth-is-flat-stationary-destroying-the-freemasonic-luciferian-globalist-globe-lie>https://www.humorousmathematics.com/post/the-earth-is-flat-stationary-destroying-the-freemasonic-luciferian-globalist-globe-lie</a>]</p>

<img src=i/bot-operationq-4.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Another post by Operation Q is titled <span class="quote">"The Illuminati Nazi World Order (NWO): Obama Is Hitler's Biological Grandson, A Khazar Rothschild"</span>. It includes a map of Nazi Antarctic bases on a flat earth, where there's Nazi bases all over the ice wall: [<a href=https://www.humorousmathematics.com/post/rothschildism-the-illuminati-nazi-world-order-nwo>https://www.humorousmathematics.com/post/rothschildism-the-illuminati-nazi-world-order-nwo</a>]</p>

<p>One of the accounts that was followed by multiple IlluminatiCoin bots was <a href=https://x.com/CHRIS18703>CHRIS18703</a>, which has Greek text in its bio like the account <a href=https://x.com/trutherbotadmin>trutherbotadmin</a>. There's also three other similar accounts called <a href=https://x.com/CHRIS180703>CHRIS180703</a>, <a href=https://x.com/CHRlS18703>CHRlS18703</a> (with lowercase <code>l</code> in place of <code>I</code>), and <a href=https://x.com/CHRlS1873>CHRlS1873</a>, so I don't know if they are accounts of Chris Deluge who was listed as the founder of Humorous Mathematics (even though Chris Deluge might of course be a pseudonym). The CHRIS accounts are part of a network of accounts that include accounts that portray Greek people, fake accounts of UFO-related people, and fake accounts of YouTube channels.</p>

<a href=#Accounts_followed_by_illuminatibot id=Accounts_followed_by_illuminatibot>Accounts followed by illuminatibot</a>
</h2>
<p>illuminatibot has 1430 followed accounts, but Twitter only shows a few dozen of the accounts. As a sample of the accounts, I looked at the last two shown accounts which were called djoca2006 and orriginals:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>djoca2006 was a bot with a Spanish name whose newest tweets were all images of Bible quotations in Spanish. It had only 13 followers but one of them was an account named <span class="quote">"illumina tibot"</span> with zero tweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The bio of the other account called orriginals said that it was a extreme patriot and a truther, but it also said this in Chinese: <span class="quote">"Bachelor's degree: Chinese Master's degree: Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan history/Ancient Chinese/Mongolian"</span>. When I checked the newest tweets by the account, within the past 24 hours it had retweeted IlluminatiCoin bots 6 times, DR. Kek and Stew Peters twice, and Mario Nawfal, Liz Churchill, and DogeDesigner once:</p>

<a href=#Accounts_followed_by_redpillb0t id=Accounts_followed_by_redpillb0t>Accounts followed by redpillb0t</a>
</h2>
<p>redpillb0t has only 50 followed accounts, but they include the accounts of InfoWars, PrisonPlanet TV, Alex Jones, and Rob Dew who is a reporter for InfoWars. [<a href=https://x.com/redpillb0t/following>https://x.com/redpillb0t/following</a>] redpillb0t also follows these two accounts which use a first name and last name as their display name and which have a profile picture of some random boomer (and the three newest tweets by the other boomer account were a retweet of healthbot, a retweet of redpillbot, and a reply to redpillbot):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-4.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>redpillbot also followed an account called Thomas Townsend Brown. It had only 4 tweets and 6 followed accounts, but the followed accounts included accounts called Phil Scheider, Dialect YouTube, and CHRIS18703, which were all also followed by redpillbot. (Thomas Townsend Brown is supposed to be an inventor of electrogravitics technology that is used in Os, and Phil Schneider is supposed to be a whistleblower who fought with aliens in an underground base.)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-5.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>DialectYoutube has posted only one tweet, which is a link to a video on a YouTube channel about physics called Dialect Philosophy. However you can tell that the Twitter account is fake, because this network of accounts also includes a similar fake account for the YouTube channel Redacted which has only two tweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-14.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The bio of both accounts shown above includes the text <span class="quote">"Watch the videos of the YouTube channel"</span>, so when I googled for the text in double quotes, I also found a fake account of a YouTube channel called Lesics, which was also followed by the fake accounts of the Dialect and Redacted channels, and the fake accounts of Thomas Townsend Brown, Phil Schneider, and Chris Langan:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-28.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>DialectYoutube has only 5 followed users, but they include CHRIS18703 which was also followed by redpillbot and Thomas Townsend Brown:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-6.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The followers of DialectYouTube include both 0ccultbot and redpillb0t, and they also include an account called ElonRevemusk39, which has the same display name <span class="quote">"Elon Reeve Musk"</span> as several of the bots that copy tweets from ElonMuskAOC and DogeDesigner (even though this account had zero tweets so I know if it's operating under the same program as the other accounts with the display name <span class="quote">"Elon Reeve Musk"</span>). The Elon Musk bot and IlluminatiCoin bots were all at the bottom of the list of followers which means that they were the oldest followed accounts, and the newer followed accounts just seemed like random bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-7.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In the image above the third account from the bottom is AthinaKilia, which has 10 tweets but the first two of them are replies to CHRIS18703:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-11.jpg width=400>

<p>AthinaKilia is also following MICHAILA41108 which was the second-oldest follower of DialectYoutube:</p>

<p>One follower of DialectYoutube is an account called EsotericBot which has only 3 tweets, but its tweets are protected:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-8.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>One of the two followed accounts of Phil Scheider and the first follower of DialectYoutube was the fake account of the Redacted YouTube channel. The Redacted account has 5 followed users, which include CHRIS18703, DialectYoutube, Thomas Townsend Brown, and a fake Chris Langan account which was also followed by DialectYoutube:</p>

<p>On Phil Scheider's list of followers, the first account from the bottom is called illuminateme369 and the third account from the bottom is called illuminati3366:</p>
<div>

<p><a href=https://x.com/illuminati3366>illuminati3366</a> has 3 posts which are all photos of freemasons. The URL in its profile is a link to a WhatsApp phone number of someone called <span class="quote">"G grand Master David"</span>:</p>

<img src=i/bot-followed-17.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>The newest tweets by <a href=https://x.com/illuminateme369>illuminateme369</a> included many quote tweets of IlluminatiCoin bots, 4 quote tweets or retweets of Concerned Citizen, 2 quote tweets of VigilantFox, and quote tweets of DogeDesigner and Jack Straw, and it also posted several tweets where it promoted RFK Jr.'s presidential campaign:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-18.jpg width=1500>
</div>
<p>The five oldest tweets by illuminateme369 are all replies to ElonMuskAOC:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-19.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>For a long time illuminateme369 didn't post any tweets, but after that its first tweets were an Elon Musk fan tweet, a reply to DR. Kek, and a reply to a Qtard account. After that it posted a quote tweet of Marjorie Taylor Greene and 5 tweets with AI-generated art. And after that it posted two replies to Richard Hirschman who was the star of the Died Suddenly film, and after that it posted a tweet about how Elon Musk was a hero:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-20.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Later it also posted many other Elon Musk fan tweets like this:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-21.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>There's also an account called <a href=https://x.com/DimitrosKilias>DimitrosKilias</a> which has 112 followers, but they include redpillb0t, thehealthb0t, 0ccultbot, ufobot, EsotericBot, CHRIS18703, MICHAILA41108, AthinaKilia, and sjlightworks (which was the second follower of Phil Scheider). They also include a fake account of Philip J. Corso, who is another famous UFO guy like Phil Scheider and Thomas Townsend Brown:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-22.jpg width=1000>

<p>CHRIS18703 also has a YouTube channel where he has published one video titled <span class="quote">"C418 Unreleased Music"</span>. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/%40CHRIS18703/videos>https://www.youtube.com/%40CHRIS18703/videos</a>] C418 is Daniel Rosenfeld who used to be the composer and sound designer for Minecraft.

<p>I no longer have access to Twitter's API because Elon started charging 100 bucks a month to use the API. So I used Twitter's web UI to manually compile a list of the followed accounts of 0ccultbot, conspiracyb0t, redpillb0t, thehackerb0t, thehealthb0t, and ufob0t. I didn't include iluminatib0t or naticoineth because they had so many followers that Twitter's web UI didn't show all followers.

<p>I looked up some of the accounts above that I wasn't familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://x.com/nwotcg>nwotcg</a> is an NFT version of the Illuminati card game.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/Anonyphant>Anonyphant</a> (Jack Hammer), <a href=https://x.com/three_cube>three_cube</a> (OccupytheWeb), and <a href=https://x.com/PrayOrSomething>PrayOrSomething</a> have an Anonymous avatar. PrayOrSomething has 2 subscriptions which are redpillb0t and illuminatibot.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/KayThanQ>KayThanQ</a> is a Qtard account which seems like a bot and which often quote tweets the IlluminatiCoin bots.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/currentcreviews>currentcreviews</a> is an account that seems like a bot which does reviews of cannabis products. However one its rare off-topic tweets was a quote tweet of DogeDesigner about how great Elon Musk was.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a> is subscribed to 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots, so they may have followed it back because the IlluminatiCoin bots seem to follow back their paid subscribers.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/WholeMarsBlog>WholeMarsBlog</a> and <a href=https://x.com/dogeofficialceo>dogeofficialceo</a> are accounts which promote Elon Musk and his companies.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/DAMNAMENEYS>DAMNAMENEYS</a> has Greek text in its bio and display name, and it has posted only tweet which is in Greek and about Greece. It has 5 followed accounts which all have a Greek name or a bio that relates to Greece. Its first two followers are <a href=https://x.com/CHRIS18703>CHRIS18703</a> and <a href=https://x.com/DimitrosKilias>DimitrosKilias</a> which both have a Greek display name. It has subscribed to 0ccultbot and redpillb0t. The account <a href=https://x.com/DimitrosKilias>trutherbotadmin</a> also has Greek text in its bio, but I don't know if it's ran by the same person who created all of these Greek accounts.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/natalie61282>natalie61282</a> is a both that portrays a Russian lady who posts random images. Its avatar is an AI-generated realistic photo of a woman which might fool some people thinking it's a real person. It has 13 subscriptions which include three IlluminatiCoin bots, Elon Musk, and DogeDesigner. It is also followed by esotericbot which has only 3 tweets and 64 followed accounts. (Added in December 2024: The account now has a new avatar that looks like a real photo of a different woman.)</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/nikkie_dikkie>nikkie_dikkie</a>'s bio says: <span class="quote">"Q Anon 🇺🇸Followed by <span class="citation" data-cites="ForgiatoBlow47">@ForgiatoBlow47</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="TheRabbitHole84">@TheRabbitHole84</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="dogeofficialceo">@dogeofficialceo</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="iluminatibot">@iluminatibot</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="three_cube">@three_cube</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="HiRezTheRapper">@HiRezTheRapper</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="WholeMarsBlog">@WholeMarsBlog</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="TRHLofficial">@TRHLofficial</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Alphafox78">@Alphafox78</span>"</span>. All of those accounts were also followed by two different IlluminatiCoin bots. The 20 newest non-reply tweets by the account included 4 different reposts of illuminatibot and DR. Kek, 3 reposts of Wall Street Silver, and one repost of thehealthb0t, Wall Street Apes, Mario Nawfal, Insider Paper, DogeDesigner, dogeofficialceo, HiRezTheRapper, and three_cube.</li>

<p><a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a> (Historian23) has zero tweets and only 8 followers, but one of them is <a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a> (Occam's Razor), which has subscribed to 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots. It also follows the <a href=https://x.com/nikkie_dikkie>nikkie_dikkie</a> Qtard bot, whose bio included a list of 9 accounts it was followed by but all of them were followed by at least two or more different IlluminatiCoin bots. The first followed account of <a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a> is an account with an Anonymous avatar.</p>
<p>The accounts followed by <a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a> are similar to the accounts followed by <a href=https://x.com/redpillb0t>redpillb0t</a>. Both of them even follow called Catherine Sheehan and Bryan Lovejoy whose profile picture is a photo of some random boomer:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-31.jpg width=600>

<p>The six newest tweets by <a href=https://x.com/101pseudoprince>101pseudoprince</a> consisted of 3 retweets of DR. Kek, 2 retweets of 0ccultbot, and one retweet of thehealthb0t:</p>

</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/ShamsunMusa>ShamsunMusa</a> is supposed to be the account of a black Muslim from Egypt. It has only 143 tweets, but about 20% of them are replies to the IlluminatiCoin bots or reposts of their tweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-32.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/eoakpobaro_>E. O. Akpobaro</a> is portrayed as an African account, but it doesn't tweet about conspiracy topics or Western current events, so it wasn't retweeting the kind of accounts that are usually retweeted by these bots. So it's yet further evidence that this network of bot accounts probably extends further than just accounts about conspiracy topics. E. O. Akpobaro also has a Linktree page with links to accounts at YouTube, LinkedIn, Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat. But for example the YouTube channel only contains videos which consist of nonsensical poems that are narrated by an African voice, even though it's difficult to tell if the videos were generated by text-to-speech or not:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-33.jpg width=600>

<p>Here E. O. Akpobaro quote tweeted an account called E. O. A. Foundation, which has only one tweet, only one follower, and 5 followed accounts. But its followed accounts also include an account called <span class="quote">"E. O. A. Mediary Services"</span> which also has only one tweet:</p>

<p><a href=https://x.com/wycl31049>wycl31049</a> is portrayed as a non-profit organization called <span class="quote">"CLIFFE COMMUNITY SERVICE ONLINE"</span>. It has 50 followers which are mostly bots that advertise dating sites, but the followers also include the accounts occamsrazor22 and DefenceOp which are connected to the IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-36.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/SerpentBearer33>SerpentBearer33</a> has only 53 tweets, but most of them are links to YouTube videos by another similar account called Unocculted Knowledge. The YouTube videos consist of occult topics narrated in a text-to-speech voice with the narrated text displayed on the screen, which is similar to the YouTube channel of E. O. Akpobaro. Both accounts are followed by the Qtard bot KayThanQ which was followed by three different IlluminatiCoin bots. The first three followers of both accounts also include accounts called presenceofbeing and AntaresIsReborn, but AntaresIsReborn seems to post a large number of retweets of SerpentBearer33, Unocculted Knowledge, presenceofbeing, and the IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>

<li><a href=https://x.com/Its_Nav_Ch>Its_Nav_Ch</a> is portrayed as the account of a bank employee from India. Most of its tweets are about Indian topics but one time it randomly retweeted illuminatibot. It has 64 followers but one of them is <a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a>.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/clavery22>clavery22</a> has an Anonymous avatar, but it's supposed to be from Tanzania and many of its tweets are about African topics. It has only a few dozen non-reply tweets but one of them is a retweet of illuminatibot.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/h18amads>h18amads</a> writes in Arabic, and its bio mentions the account <a href=https://x.com/ManUTD_AR>ManUTD_AR</a> which is an Arabic fan account of Manchester United, which also followed 4 different accounts on the list above.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/4fABkkc5xTv2aek>4fABkkc5xTv2aek</a> is portrayed as a Greek account which posts about historical topics. <a href=https://x.com/NKarteres>NKarteres</a>, <a href=https://x.com/PanosAposto1ou>PanosAposto1ou</a>, and <a href=https://x.com/Anonymo95082321>Anonymo95082321</a> are also portrayed as Greek accounts.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/ChristiMilesIV>ChristiMilesIV</a> mostly posts retweets about American current events, so its most recent tweets included retweets of the usual suspects like illuminatibot, thehealthb0t, redpillb0t, Concerned Citizen, Wall Street Silver, and Oli London.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/RichUniverse_>RichUniverse_</a> is portrayed as some guy who posts about UFOs. Among its rare tweets that weren't about UFOs, there were retweets of Wall Street Silver and Mario Nawfal and a retweet of the fake Redacted account.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/Azim_Fayziqulov>Azim_Fayziqulov</a> is portrayed as the account of a zoomer web developer from Uzbekistan. It has only 84 tweets but one of them promotes Tesla Cybertruck, one is a reply to illuminatibot, one is a reply to Elon Musk, and one is a reply to a tweet about AI-generated images of Elon Musk. Often these bots which are portrayed as software developers also seem to promote Elon Musk. The account has 55 followed users but they include 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots, and they also include the accounts currentcreviews, DimitriosKilias, and PrayOrSomething which were followed by multiple different IlluminatiCoin bots.</li>

<a href=#Tweet_about_1101_increase_in_excess_deaths_by_illuminatibot id=Tweet_about_1101_increase_in_excess_deaths_by_illuminatibot>Tweet about 1101% increase in excess deaths by illuminatibot</a>
</h2>
<p>This tweet by illuminatibot received over 2 million views: [<a href=https://x.com/iluminatibot/status/1838545168061911143>https://x.com/iluminatibot/status/1838545168061911143</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-excess-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The story about the 1101% increase seems to have come from a Substack post by Peter Sweden from 2022. [<a href=https://www.petersweden.org/p/excess-mortality-rate>https://www.petersweden.org/p/excess-mortality-rate</a>] The post is behind a paywall, but I believe Peter Sweden derived the figure using similar methodology as was described in this answer at Stack Exchange: [<a href=https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/53765/has-there-been-a-1101-increase-in-excess-deaths-among-children-aged-0-14-across>https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/53765/has-there-been-a-1101-increase-in-excess-deaths-among-children-aged-0-14-across</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can DL the <a href=https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps>dataset from EuroMOMO</a> and do the simple arithmetic yourself. (Sorry no direct link to the dataset seems possible; they use some AJAX or stuff like that.) It's not 100% clear what formula the blog claims uses, or the exact period involved, but one thing it states is <span class="quote">"compared with the same time period in 2021"</span>.</p>
<p>So let's look at a few periods; for 2021, the cumulative excess (<span class="quote">"observed count"</span> minus <span class="quote">"baseline"</span>, summed from first week of the year) is actually negative for the first half of the year (i.e. below long-term baseline) and only crosses zero in the 2nd half of that year, so for 2021 you get excess numbers (in the 0-14 age group) like</p>
<ul>
<li>First 34 weeks: 80.98</li>
<li>First 30 weeks: 23.82</li>
<li>First 29 weeks: -13.12</li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding excess numbers for 2022, all well above the baseline</p>
<ul>
<li>First 34 weeks: 855.67</li>
<li>First 30 weeks: 787.32</li>
<li>First 29 weeks: 742.06</li>
</ul>
<p>So, using the (<em>b</em>-<em>a</em>)/<em>a</em> x 100 percentage increase formula one can make various claims about the excess like:</p>
<ul>
<li>957% increase for the first 34 weeks</li>
<li>3,205% increase for the first 30 weeks</li>
<li>-5,756% increase for the first 29 weeks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweets about the 1101% increase had been posted dozens of times by different IlluminatiCoin bots since 2023. Similar tweets have also been posted many times by accounts called <a href=https://x.com/Quelle33_>Quelle33_</a> and <a href=https://x.com/source_222>source_222</a> which portray accounts of real people: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Excess+deaths+are+through+the+roof%2C+with+a+1101%25+increase+among%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Excess+deaths+are+through+the+roof%2C+with+a+1101%25+increase+among%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The tweet about excess deaths was also posted by multiple accounts which portrayed black people:</p>

<p>The tweet shown below was the oldest tweet by Quelle33_ that was returned by Twitter's search, but when I searched for a part of the text of the tweet in double quotes, there were 27 results which consisted of 21 tweets by source_222, 5 tweets by Quelle33_, and one tweet by an account called <a href=https://x.com/Abdullah_Om3r03>Abdullah_Om3r03</a>: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22In+1948%2C+Israeli+soldiers+destroyed+530+Palestinian+towns%2C+massacred+Palestinians+and+drove+75%25+of+the+native+population%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22In+1948%2C+Israeli+soldiers+destroyed+530+Palestinian+towns%2C+massacred+Palestinians+and+drove+75%25+of+the+native+population%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The avatar of Quelle33_ looks like it was generated with thispersondoesnotexist.com. When I compared it to the avatars of German users called <a href=https://x.com/tom_zeh>tom_zeh</a> and <a href=https://x.com/SoniaMarima>SoniaMarima</a> whose avatars also look like they were generated by thispersondoesnotexist.com, the eyes were located at nearly the same position in all images:</p>

<p>The tweet below has also been posted multiple times by both Quelle33_ and source_222, but apart from them Twitter's search returned only 3 other accounts which had posted the same tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22Does%F0%9F%92%89anyone%F0%9F%92%89have%F0%9F%92%89any%F0%9F%92%89idea%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22Does%F0%9F%92%89anyone%F0%9F%92%89have%F0%9F%92%89any%F0%9F%92%89idea%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>When I searched for a part of the text of the tweet below in double quotes, Twitter's search returned 30 tweets by source_222 and 19 tweets by Quelle33_ but no tweets by any other users: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22I+still+can%27t+believe+the+government+convinced+you+id%C3%ADots+to+take+3+%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22I+still+can%27t+believe+the+government+convinced+you+id%C3%ADots+to+take+3+%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>Quelle33_ and source_222 posted a large number of tweets in German up to May 2023, but after that they seem to have mostly stopped posting in German. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aquelle33_+lang%3Ade&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aquelle33_+lang%3Ade&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Asource_222+lang%3Ade&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Asource_222+lang%3Ade&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>In a snapshot of source_222's account at the Wayback Machine, the newest timeline tweets included 8 tweets about the Jordon Walker video by Project Veritas, a screenshot of an article by The People's Voice, a video about a 5G nanochip found under a microscope with 200-fold magnification, and a tweet that promoted the Died Suddenly film: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230126152849/https://twitter.com/source_222>http://web.archive.org/web/20230126152849/https://twitter.com/source_222</a>]</p>

<p>Most of the earliest tweets by source_222 promoted a Web3 project called MekaGorillaz: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Asource_222+until%3A2022-5-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Asource_222+until%3A2022-5-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>Added later: Quelle33_ was later renamed to Quelle_222. These were the accounts it had reposted at least 6 times up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets:</p>

<p>Quelle_222 retweeted tweeted this video about flat earth by Stew Peters that had about 2.4 million views (but I wonder how much traction content like this would be getting if it was not amplified artificially):</p>

<p>Quelle33_/Quelle_222 had also retweeted many tweets by the the IlluminatiCoin bots, including this tweet which quoted William Makis as suggesting that fenbendazole cures cancer:</p>
