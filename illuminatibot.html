<a href=#Initial_research_on_illuminatibot id=Initial_research_on_illuminatibot>Initial
research on illuminatibot</a>
</h2>
<p>When I started researching Twitter bots that promoted content from
controlled alternative media, one of the first accounts I looked into
was <a href=https://x.com/iluminatibot>iluminatibot</a>, because it has
over a million followers so it's one of the most popular conspiracy
accounts on Twitter, and even though it's overtly presented as a bot,
for some reason it was still followed by many real people who I followed
on Twitter.</p>
<p>The iluminatibot account is part of a network of bots that are
connected to the IlluminatiCoin cryptocurrency:
[<a href=https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin>https://linktr.ee/illuminaticoin</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-illuminatilinktree.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The iluminatibot account was created in 2015, but its oldest tweet is
a tweet from 2016, which consists of an image of a quotation with a Guy
Fawkes mask and the Anonymous logo in the bottom corner. The
second-oldest tweet is from 2019, and it consists of an image of a
pyramid with the text <span class="quote">"What IS The OCCULT?"</span>
and a definition of occultism.</p>
<p>Other early tweets by illuminatibot consist of random images and
videos related to the illuminati, and random text-only tweets that
consist of factoids like this: <span class="quote">"The Trilateral
Commission was established in 1973. Its founder and primary financial
angel was international financier, David Rockefeller."</span> When I
searched for the text of some of the factoid tweets, I found that they
had also been posted by accounts with usernames like
<a href=https://x.com/0ccultbot>0ccultbot</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/AquarianStelium>AquarianStelium</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/ConsentNo>ConsentNo</a>,

<a href=https://x.com/thekarak>thekarak</a>, and
<a href=https://x.com/VMastery>VMastery</a>. Many of the accounts were
not overtly presented as bots, so the network of bots associated with
IlluminatiCoin probably extends further than just the handful of
accounts that are listed on the LinkTree page and that are overtly
presented as bots.</p>
<p>iluminatibot posted the tweet with an Amazon affiliate link below.
When I searched for a part of the text of the tweet in double quotes, I
found that similar tweets had been posted 25 times by iluminatibot, 13
times by thehackerb0t, 13 times by 0ccultbot, 8 times by conspiracyb0t,
7 times by redpillb0t, 2 times by VMastery, 2 times by ProfaCoruja, and
once each by naticoineth, imhyali, and envylords.

</div>
<p>Illuminaticoin has Telegram channels in English, French, German,
Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean, which is
reminiscent of how content by Miles Guo is translated into various
languages. One of the bots which posts the same factoid-type tweets as
iluminaticoin is <a href=https://x.com/Renemendoza322>Renemendoza322</a>
which primarily posts in Spanish, and another one is
<a href=https://x.com/Fisica_Geral>Fisica_Geral</a> which primarily
posts in Portuguese.</p>
<p>When I searched for the text of one of the factoid-style tweets by
iluminatibot which happened to be about Muslims, I found that it had
been posted by bots that pretended to be Muslims:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-muslim.jpg width=510>
</div>
<p>There are also a few accounts related to IlluminatiCoin on Instagram.
One of them is called retro1uparmy, whose posts consist of a mixture of
photos of luxury watches and illuminati-style images. Its bio has links
to similar Instagram accounts called illuminaticoin.io and
owltradingbot.io:
[<a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CyBd7DRLGMV/>https://www.instagram.com/p/CyBd7DRLGMV/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-instagram.jpg width=620>
</div>
<p>illuminatibot has promoted Stew ops about hydras, graphene nanobots,
hydrogel, and calamari clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-stewop.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Alex Jones frequently retweets iluminatibot, but iluminatibot and
thehackerb0t also posted an Amazon affiliate link to a book by Alex
Jones:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-alexbook.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>When illuminatibot was followed for a while by Elon Musk, it posted
two tweets about how it was followed by Elon, which looked like tweets
written by a human, so maybe illuminatibot is a hybrid between a bot and
a manually-ran account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-iluminatielon.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Both tweets by iluminatibot above featured the word <span
class="quote">"lol"</span>. When I searched for
<code>from:iluminatibot lol</code>, I found other tweets that seemed like
they might have been written by a human, and that weren't copied by many
different bot accounts.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Ailuminatibot+lol&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Ailuminatibot+lol&amp;f=live</a>]
One of the tweets said <span class="quote">"all the accounts i follow
are me as well lol"</span> and another tweet said <span
class="quote">"all the twitter pages i follow are also me lol"</span>.
The other tweet had also been posted by redpillbot, but I didn't find
any other accounts which had posted either of the tweets.</p>
<p>The network of bots associated with IlluminatiCoin seems to include
accounts that portay real people, like mikeyp920, which had posted the
same tweet as conspiracyb0t.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22We+know+for+a+fact+that+Obama+flew+in+$65,000+worth+of%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22We+know+for+a+fact+that+Obama+flew+in+$65,000+worth+of%22&amp;f=live</a>]
The most recent tweets by mikeyp920 included a bunch of quote tweets or
retweets by accounts in the IlluminatiCoin network, but they also
included tweets about flat earth by accounts like nikola 3:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-mikeyp.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>There's many other accounts that are portrayed as accounts of real
people but that post tweets from the same pool as the illuminati
bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-paki.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>One of the accounts shown in the screenshot above is JournalistNimra,
which tweets in multiple languages like Miles Guo's bots. It has also
retweeted many tweets by the illuminati bots, and by accounts like Peter
Sweden that are promoted by bots that also promote the illuminati
bots:</p>

<h2>
<a href=#The_Truther id=The_Truther>The Truther</a>
</h2>
<p>IlluminatiCoin's Medium blog has an article titled <span
class="quote">"Unveiling the Truther Conspiracy: The Enigmatic Figure
Behind IlluminatiCoin"</span>, where the mysterious person who is
supposedly running the bots is called <span class="quote">"the
Truther"</span>:
[<a href=https://medium.com/&#x40;illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e>https://medium.com/@illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He seems to be in an active cyber and information war with the US
intelligence agencies; the NSA and the CIA, and he is always watching
them and aware of their activities... What qualifications could this man
possess? His posts indicate he has a PHD in cryptography and he is a
potential network engineer. A PHD in cryptography might explain how he
devised such complex and unbreakable NATI puzzles.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>A man of many talents and immense knowledge; could Truther be a
government covert agent trained by the NSA? Furthermore, could Truther's
pages on Twitter be a federal government psyop? Truther states in his
posts that <span class="quote">"The NSA is the largest employer of
mathematicians in the United States, and possibly the world"</span>, yet
the NSA is also constantly on the hunt for intelligent cryptographers
too, cryptography and the NSA go hand in hand. Could he be an NSA
employee acting out an operation relating the the revelation of the
method? Could his entire Twitter operation just be a method of revealing
breadcrumbs of truth through the revelation of the method? A common
strategy of the Cabal too. Is Truther a Cabal member? Not only an elite
hacker but someone considered apart of the elite. His vast knowledge of
the occult could indicate his membership of the Illuminati.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many posts in the Medium blog look like AI-generated, but the text
above featured an error where the word <span class="quote">"the"</span>
was repeated twice in a row, which makes the text look like it was
written by a human, even though the post might be a mixture of
human-written and AI-generated text.</p>
<p>Next the Medium post says that the Truther owns a spaceship, and the
post starts talking about the Galactic Federation and the Great
Awakening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He even claims to own a spaceship which he claims is a <span
class="quote">"Dodge"</span> and that he is in space <span
class="quote">"avoiding all the toxins"</span>. Could Truther be a
delegation or emissary sent by the Galactic Federation to assist
humanity?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Truther is an enigmatic mysterious figure of
the modern age, a mysterious figure ushering in the new dawn, a golden
age of the Great Awakening of humanity and an era of truth and
freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case that the article was entirely or partially generated by
AI, some characteristics which are attributed to the Truther in the
article are not necessarily part of his canonical identity.</p>
<p>An account called
<a href=https://x.com/33isprogrammed>33isprogrammed</a> does Twitter
spaces about Illuminaticoin:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-iluminatispace.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>In April 2024 33isprogrammed announced that <span class="quote">"the
Truther"</span> had stepped down as the head of the IlluminatiCoin
project because he had suffered an assassination attempt, but the story
was probably made up:
[<a href=https://x.com/33isprogrammed/status/1782256789980852724>https://x.com/33isprogrammed/status/1782256789980852724</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's rumored that our creator <span class="citation"
data-cites="iluminatibot">@iluminatibot</span> was attacked by an <span
class="quote">"unknown"</span> source after launching $NATI the ERC20
token on Friday the 13th October 2023.</p>
<p>His tires were replaced with bald tires while he was on a road trip
with his family. During a rain storm on his way home his vehicle
hydroplaned and flipped 5-7 times in the ditch.</p>
<p>Fortunately nobody was hurt. Truther then decided it was best for his
family if he stepped down from the project selling his portion of
tokens.</p>
<p>The powers to be don't want $NATI or Truther to be running the
project as the truth is to dangerous for them. #NATI is building a
community of truthers who do not conform with the limitations placed on
humanity based on ancient black magick rituals.</p>
<p>IDC, the truth is worth it and the project will continue with out
without Truther at the mantel. Molesting children is not right and the
truth must be exposed for humanity to transform into the Advanced Space
Race Civilization we were designed to be.</p>
<p>Although we would love to have Truther back as his knowledge on the
<span class="quote">"conspiracy"</span> topics are among the top
rankings, WE ARE NATI, and the project will continue.</p>

<a href=#Old_thread_about_trutherbot_accounts_by_conspirator0 id=Old_thread_about_trutherbot_accounts_by_conspirator0>Old
thread about trutherbot accounts by conspirator0</a>
</h2>
<p>On IlluminatiCoin's Medium blog, the operation that runs their bots
was called the <span class="quote">"Trutherbot operation"</span>.
[<a href=https://medium.com/&#x40;illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e>https://medium.com/@illuminaticoin.io/unveiling-the-truther-conspiracy-the-enigmatic-figure-behind-illuminaticoin-4753661f2c8e</a>]
When I searched Twitter for the keyword <span
class="quote">"trutherbot"</span>, I found this old thread from 2018 by
a user called conspirator0:
[<a href=https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1009624297806225408>https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1009624297806225408</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the process of researching various suspicious Twitter accounts, a
new dodgy <span class="quote">"news"</span> site turned up on the
proverbial radar - nodisinfo(dot)net. Spoiler alert - the name is not an
accurate description of the content.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>This chart shows the frequency of various terms in tweets linking to
nodisinfo(dot)net from a sample of 1487 accounts (probably should have
gone for one more). The overarching theme: everything from chemical
attacks in Syria to school shootings to 9/11 is a false flag.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>What else do the accounts that link to nodisinfo(dot)net tweet about?
The <span class="quote">"deep state"</span> category is quite popular;
the interest in Crimea and Ukraine in 2014 is notable.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>What other news sites do accounts that link to nodisinfo(dot)net link
in their tweets? The number one destination is Russia Today, and
rounding out the menagerie are a variety of right wing
conspiracy-oriented sites, along with Sputnik News.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-4.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Bots don't appear to be a major portion of the accounts linking to
nodisinfo(dot)net, but they're far from nonexistent. 52 of the accounts
in the sample of 1487 tweet 24/7, post 90+% of their tweets via an
automation service such as IFTTT, or both.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-5.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>One set of accounts in the previous tweet stands out - there are
several bots with the naming scheme <span
class="quote">"trutherbox(X)"</span>. Seven showed up in the
nodisinfo(dot)net set; digging around turns up at least six more.
They've been dormant for months, but let's take a look anyway.</p>
<p>The trutherbot accounts unsurprisingly post a lot of tweets that are
repeated across several of the accounts. The repeated tweet about being
a bot is kinda funny; some of the others are less humorous.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-6.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-7.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-8.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-9.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>The tweet schedules for the trutherbots are very similar. They are
all 24/7 accounts, and they tend to have similar gaps in activity as
well, with some variance.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbot-10.jpg width=400><img src=i/bot-trutherbot-11.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Most of the trutherbots post tweets at 15 minute intervals or
multiples thereof. The sole exception is <span class="citation"
data-cites="trutherbotnet">@trutherbotnet</span>, which seems to
aggregate tweets from the others via IFTTT (the other 12 tweet via
custom apps with the same name as the account in question.)</p>

</div>
<p>What do the trutherbots tweet? Mostly memes, with <span
class="quote">"deep state"</span> material in second place. These charts
show some examples of the common terms - one includes a category for the
memes to demonstrate the relative proportion. The others shows tweet
topics with the meme tweets removed.</p>

<p>The first account was <span class="citation"

2012 to July 2015, when it was suspended. The tweets visible on Internet

bitcoin. A number of other trutherbots were created following the
suspension.</p>

<p>Many of the old trutherbot accounts had a Guy Fawkes avatar, but many
of the accounts that are followed by two or more IlluminatiCoin bots
also have a Guy Fawkes avatar, like Anonyphant, three_cube,
PrayOrSomething, and anonymousgum.</p>

<p>When I searched for the text of a tweet by Illuminatibot in double
quotes, I found that the same tweet had been posted by an account called
<a href=https://x.com/trutherbotlight>trutherbotlight</a>, but for some
reason it hadn't been deleted like the other trutherbot accounts:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>The trutherbotlight account stopped tweeting in 2020. Its followers
included accounts with a Guy Fawkes avatar called
<a href=https://x.com/trutherbotsamur>trutherbotsamur</a> which stopped
tweeting in 2023 and <a href=https://x.com/TrutherbotRG>TrutherbotRG</a>
which stopped tweeting in 2019.</p>
<p>When I scraped the reposts of TrutherbotRG up to the point when the
infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets, I noticed that there's
still many other accounts whose name starts with <span
class="quote">"trutherbot"</span> that had't been deleted, but all of
them had stopped tweeting by 2023:</p>

<p>Here trutherbotdank posted a reply that looks human-written to
PrayOrSomething, which is followed by 3 of the accounts listed on
IlluminatiCoin's LinkTree page:

<p>The location of

Greek:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-trutherbotlight-2.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>When I mapped out which accounts were followed by multiple
IlluminatiCoin bots, I found many small accounts that portray Greek
people or that have Greek text in their bio, like CHRIS18703,
MICHAILA41108, AthinaKilia, and DimitriosKilias. The Greek accounts are
connected to fake accounts of UFO-related people and fake accounts of a
few YouTube channels.</p>
<p>The bio of trutherbotadmin linked to trutherbot.com, which was a blog
that mostly contsisted of links to conspiracy videos:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/>https://web.archive.org/web/20150704043110/https://www.trutherbot.com/</a>]</p>

<p>The website even had a forum, but the Wayback Machine had only one
snapshot for the index of the forum.

The snapshot shows that usernames of users on the forum included Max
Dewald, The Dude, Secure Lemons, myg0t, bert, THCris, Patonplace,
trutherbot, BADM0T0RF1NGER, Gonzo710, ThirdEyeTruth, Secure Lemons, and

<p>Most of the trutherbot accounts seem to have stopped tweeting by 2023
or earlier. I didn't find any of the trutherbot accounts using the
hashtag <span class="quote">"#Trutherbot"</span> after 2023.
[<a href=https://x.com/hashtag/Trutherbot>https://x.com/hashtag/Trutherbot</a>]</p>
<p>Many of the trutherbot accounts used the hashtag <span
class="quote">"#Trutherbotarmy"</span>, but the latest tweets with the
hashtag were all posted by the account
<a href=https://x.com/naticoineth>naticoineth</a> which hosts Twitter
spaces about IlluminatiCoin.
[<a href=https://x.com/hashtag/trutherbotarmy?f=live>https://x.com/hashtag/trutherbotarmy?f=live</a>]
Another interesting tweet with the hashtag was posted by a user called
<a href=https://x.com/yruidjits>yruidjits</a>, who posted an image which
said that <span class="quote">"#TrutherBotArmy is a splinter group of
#Anonymous"</span>, but he has also been featured as a speaker in the
IlluminatiCoin spaces:</p>
<div>

[<a href=https://t.me/truth3rb0tnet>https://t.me/truth3rb0tnet</a>] In a
Reddit thread where someone asked what happened to trutherbot, a user

<p>The newest post in the blog is from November 2023 and the oldest post
is from 2020, and many of the links on the Link-Tube page also go to old
posts from 2020.</p>
<p>The blog has three staff members listed, who are founder Chris
Deluge, co-founder Josh Alexandria, and managing editor Operation Q.
Operation Q was also featured in some episodes of the Humorous
Mathematics podcast along with the other two guys. Below Operation Q's
name, there's a link to the same link-tube.com page that was linked by
IlluminatiCoin, so maybe Operation Q is one of the people who runs the
IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-operationq-3.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p><span class="quote">"Deluge"</span> and <span
class="quote">"Alexandria"</span> sound like they might be pseudonyms,
because they are rare names, but they are related to the occult themes
of the great flood and Egypt.</p>
<p>When I googled for a combination of the names Chris Deluge and Josh
Alexandria in double quotes, there were only 8 results, but half of the
results were about episodes of the Humorous Mathematics podcast. The
podcast used to be hosted at Anchor.fm and several other platforms, but
the podcast now seems to have been deleted from all platforms.

The description of the podcast said <span class="quote">"Dallas based
coincidence theorists, The Humorous Mathematicians, discuss current
events and topics revolving around the current state of America, Qanon,
child trafficking, the Deep State and other dark forces.
WWG1WGA"</span>.</p>
<p>The podcast was also posted on archive.org, but the audio files of
the podcast are now set as private.
[<a href=https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Humorous+Mathematics%22>https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Humorous+Mathematics%22</a>]
There's a total of 27 episodes of the podcast at archive.org, but based
on the descriptions of the episodes, I found only 5 episodes which
featured a guest. One of the guests was a <span class="quote">"former
CIA officer"</span> called Brandon Blackburn. Another guest was someone
called Vinctum from the Netherlands, who used to have a YouTube channel
about Q, but the old videos on his channel have been deleted, and his
channel now consists of inspirational music with anime thumbnails.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200420162226/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZ_FipjV1hrExi9uDWesGA>http://web.archive.org/web/20200420162226/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZ_FipjV1hrExi9uDWesGA</a>]
The three other guests were people called <span class="quote">"Sophia
Raw"</span>, <span class="quote">"Witsup"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"Denton, Tx Local Hip Hop Artist and Community Activist,
AV the Great"</span>. I found only two episodes of the podcast which
were still available online, which were both posted on YouTube. In the
other episode the guest was the former CIA officer Brandon Blackburn.

<p>Even though the IlluminatiCoin bots don't generally promote flat
earth, Operation Q wrote a post for Humorous Mathematics titled <span

<p>When I wrote this, illuminatibot had 1,430 followed accounts, but
Twitter's web UI only showed a few dozen of the accounts. The last two
shown accounts were called <a href=https://x.com/djoca2006>djoca2006</a>
and <a href=https://x.com/orriginals>orriginals</a>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-1.jpg width=510>
</div>
<p>djoca2006 is a bot with a Spanish name whose newest tweets were all
images of Bible quotations in Spanish. It had only 13 followers but one
of them was an account named <span class="quote">"illumina tibot"</span>
with zero tweets:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The bio of the other account had a bunch of American flags and said
<span class="quote">"Xtreme Patriot"</span>, but it also said this in
Chinese: <span class="quote">"Bachelor's degree: Chinese Master's
degree: Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan history/Ancient
Chinese/Mongolian"</span>. When I checked the newest tweets by the
account, within the past 24 hours it had retweeted IlluminatiCoin bots 6
times, DR. Kek and Stew Peters twice, and Mario Nawfal, Liz Churchill,
and DogeDesigner once (which in my other articles about Twitter bots I
have identified as accounts that are frequently promoted by bots):</p>

included the accounts of InfoWars, PrisonPlanet TV, Alex Jones, and Rob
Dew who is a reporter for InfoWars.
[<a href=https://x.com/redpillb0t/following>https://x.com/redpillb0t/following</a>]
The IlluminatiCoin bots have also promoted a book by Alex Jones, and
Alex Jones frequently reposts the IlluminatiCoin bots. IlluminatiCoin is
connected to the Humorous Mathematics podcast, which was run by guys
from Texas, so I don't know if the IlluminatiCoin operation might
somehow be based in Texas.</p>
<p>redpillb0t also follows these two accounts whose display name
consists of a first name and a last name, and whose profile picture is
an image of some random boomer (and the three newest tweets by the other
boomer account were a retweet of healthbot, a retweet of redpillbot, and
a reply to redpillbot):</p>

<p>redpillbot also followed an account called Thomas Townsend Brown. It
had only 4 tweets and 6 followed accounts, but the followed accounts
included accounts called Phil Scheider, Dialect YouTube, and CHRIS18703,
which were all also followed by redpillbot:</p>
<div>

<p>Thomas Townsend Brown is supposed to be an inventor of
electrogravitics technology that is used in UFOs, and Phil Schneider is
supposed to be a whistleblower who fought with aliens at an underground
base.</p>
<p>DialectYoutube has only one tweet, which links to a YouTube video
about physics on a channel called Dialect Philosophy. However you can
tell the Twitter account is fake, because this network of accounts also
includes a similar fake account for the YouTube channel Redacted, which
has only two tweets which are both similar links to YouTube videos:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-14.jpg width=1000>

<p>The bio of both accounts shown above includes the text <span

<p>I looked up some of the accounts above that I wasn't familiar
with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://x.com/nwotcg>nwotcg</a> is an NFT version of the
Illuminati card game.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/Anonyphant>Anonyphant</a> (Jack Hammer),
<a href=https://x.com/three_cube>three_cube</a> (OccupytheWeb), and
<a href=https://x.com/PrayOrSomething>PrayOrSomething</a> have a Guy
Fawkes avatar. PrayOrSomething is subscribed to 2 accounts, which are
redpillb0t and illuminatibot.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/KayThanQ>KayThanQ</a> is a Qtard account which
seems like a bot and which often quotes the IlluminatiCoin bots.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/currentcreviews>currentcreviews</a> is an
account which seems like a bot that does reviews of cannabis products.
However one its rare off-topic tweets was a quote tweet of DogeDesigner
about how great Elon Musk was.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a> is subscribed
to 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots, so they may have followed it back
because the IlluminatiCoin bots seem to follow back their paid
subscribers.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/WholeMarsBlog>WholeMarsBlog</a> and
<a href=https://x.com/dogeofficialceo>dogeofficialceo</a> are accounts
which promote Elon Musk and his companies.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/DAMNAMENEYS>DAMNAMENEYS</a> has Greek text in
its bio and display name, and it has posted only one tweet, which is a
text about Greece written in Greek. It has 5 followed accounts which all
have a Greek name or a bio that relates to Greece. Its first two
followers are <a href=https://x.com/CHRIS18703>CHRIS18703</a> and
<a href=https://x.com/DimitrosKilias>DimitrosKilias</a> which both have
a Greek display name. It has subscribed to 0ccultbot and redpillb0t. The
account <a href=https://x.com/trutherbotadmin>trutherbotadmin</a> also
has Greek text in its bio, but I don't know if it's run by the same
person who created these Greek accounts.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/natalie61282>natalie61282</a> is a bot that
portrays a Russian lady who posts random images. Its avatar is an
AI-generated near-realistic image of a woman which might fool some
people thinking it's a real person. It has 13 subscriptions, which
include three IlluminatiCoin bots, Elon Musk, and DogeDesigner. It is
also followed by esotericbot, which has only 3 tweets and 64 followed
accounts.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/nikkie_dikkie>nikkie_dikkie</a> has a bio that
says: <span class="quote">"Q Anon 🇺🇸Followed by <span class="citation"

<p><a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a> (Historian23) has zero
tweets and only 8 followers, but one of them is
<a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a> (Occam's Razor),
which has subscribed to 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots. hstga23 also
follows the <a href=https://x.com/nikkie_dikkie>nikkie_dikkie</a> Qtard
bot, whose bio included a list of 9 accounts it was followed by but all
of them were followed by at least 2 or more different IlluminatiCoin
bots. The first followed account of
<a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a> is an account with a Guy
Fawkes avatar.</p>
<p>The accounts followed by <a href=https://x.com/hstga23>hstga23</a>
are similar to the accounts followed by
<a href=https://x.com/redpillb0t>redpillb0t</a>. Both of them even
follow the accounts called Catherine Sheehan and Bryan Lovejoy with
random boomer avatars:</p>

<p>The 6 newest tweets by
<a href=https://x.com/101pseudoprince>101pseudoprince</a> consisted of 3

<p><a href=https://x.com/ShamsunMusa>ShamsunMusa</a> portrays an account

them are replies to the IlluminatiCoin bots or reposts of tweets by the
IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-32.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/eoakpobaro_>E. O. Akpobaro</a> looks like a bot
that portrays an African poet, but it doesn't have tweets about
conspiracy topics. So that's yet further evidence that this network of
bot accounts probably extends further than just accounts about
conspiracy topics. E. O. Akpobaro seems like some kind of a
multi-platform bot personality, beause it also has accounts at LinkTree,
YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. The YouTube channel
consists of videos for nonsensical poems that are narrated by an African
text-to-speech voice:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-33.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Here E. O. Akpobaro quote tweeted an account called E. O. A.
Foundation, which has only one tweet, only one follower, and 5 followed
accounts. The followed accounts include an account called <span

tweet:</p>

<p><a href=https://x.com/wycl31049>wycl31049</a> portrays an account of
a non-profit organization called <span class="quote">"CLIFFE COMMUNITY
SERVICE ONLINE"</span>. It has 50 followers which are mostly bots that
advertise dating sites, but the followers also include occamsrazor22 and
DefenceOp, which are connected to the IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-36.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p><a href=https://x.com/SerpentBearer33>SerpentBearer33</a> has only 53
tweets, but most of them are links to YouTube videos by another similar
account called Unocculted Knowledge. The YouTube channel consists of
text-only videos narrated by a text-to-speech voice, similar to the
videos by E. O. Akpobaro. Both SerpentBearer33 and Unocculted Knowledge
are followed by the Qtard bot KayThanQ which was followed by three
different IlluminatiCoin bots. The first three followers of both
accounts include
<a href=https://x.com/presenceofbeing>presenceofbeing</a> and
<a href=https://x.com/AntaresIsReborn>AntaresIsReborn</a>, but
AntaresIsReborn has posted many retweets of SerpentBearer33, Unocculted
Knowledge, presenceofbeing, and the IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-followed-38.jpg width=1500>

<p>These were other accounts that were followed by two or more small
accounts linked to the IlluminatiCoin bots:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://x.com/kadisha_at33157>kadisha_at33157</a> has only
one tweet which is a retweet of 0ccultbot.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/Its_Nav_Ch>Its_Nav_Ch</a> portrays an account
of a bank employee from India. Most of its tweets are about Indian
topics but one time it randomly retweeted illuminatibot. It has 64
followers but one of them is
<a href=https://x.com/occamsrazor22>occamsrazor22</a>.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/clavery22>clavery22</a> has a Guy Fawkes
avatar, but it's supposed to be from Tanzania and many of its tweets are
about African topics. It has only a few dozen non-reply tweets, but one
of them is a retweet of illuminatibot.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/h18amads>h18amads</a> writes in Arabic, and
its bio mentions the account
<a href=https://x.com/ManUTD_AR>ManUTD_AR</a> which is an Arabic fan
account of Manchester United, which also followed 4 different accounts
on my list of accounts followed by two or more small accounts that are

Greek people.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/ChristiMilesIV>ChristiMilesIV</a> mostly posts
retweets about American current events. Its most recent tweets included
retweets of illuminatibot, thehealthb0t, redpillb0t, Concerned Citizen,
Wall Street Silver, and Oli London.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/RichUniverse_>RichUniverse_</a> portrays a guy
who posts about UFOs. Among its rare tweets that weren't about UFOs,
there were retweets of Wall Street Silver and Mario Nawfal and a retweet
of the fake Redacted account.</li>
<li><a href=https://x.com/Azim_Fayziqulov>Azim_Fayziqulov</a> portrays
an account of a zoomer web developer from Uzbekistan. It has only 84
tweets, but one of them promotes Tesla Cybertruck, one is a reply to
illuminatibot, one is a reply to Elon Musk, and one is a reply to a
tweet about AI-generated images of Elon Musk. I have noticed a pattern
where bots that portray software developers also tend to promote Elon
Musk. The zoomer web developer from Uzbekistan has 55 followed users,
but they include 5 different IlluminatiCoin bots, and they include
currentcreviews, DimitriosKilias, and PrayOrSomething, which are all
followed by multiple IlluminatiCoin bots.</li>

about 1101% increase in excess deaths by illuminatibot</a>
</h2>
<p>This tweet by illuminatibot received over 2 million views:
[<a href=https://x.com/iluminatibot/status/1838545168061911143>https://x.com/iluminatibot/status/1838545168061911143</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/bot-excess-2.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>The story about the 1101% increase in excess deaths seems to have
originated from a Substack post by Peter Sweden from 2022.
[<a href=https://www.petersweden.org/p/excess-mortality-rate>https://www.petersweden.org/p/excess-mortality-rate</a>]
The post is behind a paywall so I wasn't able to see how Peter Sweden
derived his figure, but I believe he relied on similar methodology that
was described in this answer at Stack Exchange:
[<a href=https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/53765/has-there-been-a-1101-increase-in-excess-deaths-among-children-aged-0-14-across>https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/53765/has-there-been-a-1101-increase-in-excess-deaths-among-children-aged-0-14-across</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can DL the
<a href=https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps>dataset from
EuroMOMO</a> and do the simple arithmetic yourself. (Sorry no direct
link to the dataset seems possible; they use some AJAX or stuff like
that.) It's not 100% clear what formula the blog claims uses, or the
exact period involved, but one thing it states is <span
class="quote">"compared with the same time period in 2021"</span>.</p>
<p>So let's look at a few periods; for 2021, the cumulative excess
(<span class="quote">"observed count"</span> minus <span
class="quote">"baseline"</span>, summed from first week of the year) is
actually negative for the first half of the year (i.e. below long-term
baseline) and only crosses zero in the 2nd half of that year, so for
2021 you get excess numbers (in the 0-14 age group) like</p>
<ul>
<li>First 34 weeks: 80.98</li>
<li>First 30 weeks: 23.82</li>
<li>First 29 weeks: -13.12</li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding excess numbers for 2022, all well above the
baseline</p>
<ul>
<li>First 34 weeks: 855.67</li>
<li>First 30 weeks: 787.32</li>
<li>First 29 weeks: 742.06</li>
</ul>
<p>So, using the (<em>b</em>-<em>a</em>)/<em>a</em> x 100 percentage
increase formula one can make various claims about the excess like:</p>
<ul>
<li>957% increase for the first 34 weeks</li>
<li>3,205% increase for the first 30 weeks</li>
<li>-5,756% increase for the first 29 weeks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The IlluminatiCoin bots have posted dozens of tweets about the 1101%
increase in excess deaths. Similar tweets have also been posted by

<p>In a snapshot of source_222's account at the Wayback Machine, the
newest timeline tweets included 8 tweets about the Jordon Walker video

this would get if it was not amplified artificially):</p>

<p>Quelle33_/Quelle_222 had also retweeted many tweets by the
IlluminatiCoin bots, like this tweets where William Makis said that
fenbendazole cures cancer:</p>

In January 2025 Makis gained a purple checkmark next to his Substack
name, which means that he has at least 10,000 paid subscribers.

His minimum monthly subscription fee shown to me was 5 euros, even
though people from other countries are shown prices in other
currencies.</p>
<p>Before ivermectin and fenbendazole emerged as the miracle cures for
turbo cancer, both of them were presented as cures for Morgellons
disease:

<p>William Makis was a member of the <span class="quote">"Chief Medical
and Scientific Board"</span> of TWC Canada.

TWC's Chief Scientific Officer is Peter McCullough, who has coauthored
two papers with the Morgellons guru Raphael Stricker, whose medical
board issued a complaint against him in 2019 because he prescribed
ivermectin as a treatment for Morgellons disease without obtaining
informed consent.
