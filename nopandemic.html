<title>Comments to no-pandemic theorists (part 1)</title>
<h1>Comments to no-pandemic theorists (part 1) - <a href=index.html>sars2.net</a></h1><div class=dates>First published 2023-09-09 UTC, last modified 2026-02-24 UTC</div><p>Peter Duesberg said that HIV has been isolated and sequenced but that
HIV is a harmless passenger virus which is not the cause of AIDS. I have
coined the term <span class="quote">"neo-Duesbergians"</span> to refer
to the Duesbergian camp of conspiracy theorists who claim that the
SARS-CoV-2 virus was not the cause of the deaths that were attributed
COVID, even though the neo-Duesbergians either say that the SARS-CoV-2
virus exists, or that it is not important if the virus exists or not, or
that they don't know if the virus exists or not. I have also referred to
the same group of people as the <span class="quote">"no-pandemic"</span>
camp since one of their mantras is that there was no COVID pandemic, and
I have referred to them as the <span
class="quote">"no-virus-lite"</span> camp, because they hold many of the
same views as the people who claim that viruses do not exist, and
because a few luminaries of the camp like J.J. Couey and Mike Yeadon
have said that they became enlightened about the lack of a pandemic
after they looked into what the no-virus people were saying.</p>
<p>People from the neo-Duesbergian/no-pandemic/no-virus-lite camp have
suggested that the deaths attributed to COVID were caused by vaccines,
by ventilators, by drugs like Remdesivir or midazolam, by rebranded
influenza, by bacterial pneumonia, by reduced prescription of
antibiotics, by supplementary oxygen treatment, by psychological stress,
by heat waves in the summer, by opioid overdoses, or by some kind of a
release of unspecified toxins.</p>
<p>This HTML file consists of my comments to people who claim that there
was no pandemic, or that the deaths attributed to COVID were not caused
by SARS-CoV-2. I originally published this file because Martin Neil
asked me to publish an article about my comments to his Substack.</p>

<p>A common cutoff for determining whether two viruses belong to the
same species or not is whether the whole genome sequences of the viruses
have over 90% nucleotide identity.</p>
<p>If in January 2020 you did a BLAST search for the genome of
SARS-CoV-22, the best match was the bat virus ZC45, which has about 88%
identity with Wuhan-Hu-1 if you ignore positions where either sequence
has a gap. For example in a tweet on January 18th 2020 UTC, Dinggang
Wang posted the following photo of a BLAST search for the genome of
SARS-CoV-2:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118155832/https://twitter.com/ding_gang/status/1218547052084441088>https://web.archive.org/web/20200118155832/https://twitter.com/ding_gang/status/1218547052084441088</a>]</p>

<p>There is no full genome sequence of a virus which was published at
GenBank before 2020 and which has over 90% nucleotide identity with
Wuhan-Hu-1 (unless there is some secret genome sequence which had been
deleted before early 2020 and which was never discovered by COVID
researchers). The RdRp sequence of RaTG13 was published at GenBank in
2016 but it is not a full genome.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/983856042>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/983856042</a>]
The Malayan pangolin sequence MP789 has about 90.2% nucleotide identity
with Wuhan-Hu-1 if you ignore positions where either sequence has a gap,
and even though MP789 was already described in the Liu et al. paper
which was published in October 2019, MP789 wasn't submitted to GenBank
until 2020. So it doesn't count either.</p>
<p>The following code downloads sarbecoviruses with a publication date
in 2019 or earlier from GenBank, and it then does a multiple sequence
alignment of the viruses along with Wuhan-Hu-1, and it calculates the
percentage identity of each virus to Wuhan-Hu-1 so that positions where
either sequence has a gap are ignored. You can see that ZC45 ranks
highest with about 88.11% identity (even though if you do a pairwise
alignment of only ZC45 and Wuhan-Hu-1, they get about 88.15%
identity):</p>

<p>If SARS-CoV-2 was not a novel virus, then was MERS-CoV not novel
either? For about half a year until MERS-CoV was named, it used to be
called <span class="quote">"novel coronavirus"</span> or <span
class="quote">"nCoV"</span> or even <span class="quote">"novel SARS-like
coronavirus"</span>:

<p>Other merbecoviruses like HKU4 and HKU5 had been discovered before
MERS-CoV, but MERS-CoV has only about 71% identity with HKU4 and HKU5.
So the reason why MERS-CoV was called a novel virus was because it
actually represented a newly-described species of virus.</p>

</h3>
<p>If SARS-CoV-2 would have been in widespread circulation long before
2020, then the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in early 2020
would be more diverse, except perhaps in the scenario where the earlier
undocumented strains would've been replaced by the Wuhan strain, like
how Omicron ended up replacing pre-Omicron strains.</p>
<p>But actually there's 54 SARS-CoV-2 sequences that were submitted to
GISAID in January 2020, but only 2 samples have more than 10 mutations
from Wuhan-Hu-1, and even those are likely to be the result of
sequencing or assembly errors:</p>

<p>In the output above, the first column shows the publication date, the
second column shows the collection date, the seventh column shows the
number of nucleotide changes from Wuhan-Hu-1, and the eighth column
shows the list of nucleotide changes from Wuhan-Hu-1. There's two
samples with more than 10 mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1. The other sample is
EPI_ISL_406799 which has 25 mutations, but 22 of them are not found in
any other sample submitted before April 2020, and there's also 8
inserted segments which are likely the result of sequencing errors,
since there normally wouldn't be such a high ratio of inserts to spot
mutations, and the length of most inserts is not even a multiple of 3 so
the inserts would result in frameshifts. The other sample is
EPI_ISL_406592 which has 27 mutations, but 21 of the mutations are not
found in any other sample submitted before April 2020, so they may have
been something like the result not using a MAPQ cutoff when doing
variant calling, and many of the mutations appear at nearby positions
(like 4728, 4729, and 4739; 6834 and 6838; and 26755 and 26759), so the
mutations may have been the result of doing global alignment without
adapter trimming or without trimming low-quality bases from the ends of
reads.</p>
<p>Kumar et al. reconstructed an ancestor of known strains of
SARS-CoV-2, which they called proCoV2 and which has only 3 mutations
relative to Wuhan-Hu-1, which are C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C.
[<a href=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/8/3046/6257226>https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/8/3046/6257226</a>]
The identical set of three mutations is found in the WA1 sample, which
is supposed to have come from the first known COVID patient in the US
who has become known as the <span class="quote">"Snohomish County
man"</span>. Based on a linear regression for the number of mutations
from proCoV2/WA1 in GISAID samples collected in 2020, the date of
divergence between known strains of SARS-CoV-2 would be around early
September 2019 (even though the trend in early 2020 doesn't actually
seem to be linear, and in the plot below if you imagine drawing a curved
regression line based on the distribution of points in early 2020, it
would appear to cross the x-axis closer to the end of 2019):</p>

<p>In the WeChat article where Winjor Small Mountain Dog wrote about how
he discovered the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, he wrote that
their lab used an automatic procedure where they scanned sequencing
reads for the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, so he found that
one sample they sequenced matched SARS1:

<div>

<p>However a similar procedure is also used in other labs around the
world, so if SARS-CoV-2 had been in widespread circulation in humans
long before 2020, it would've also been detected by other sequencing
labs. And the SARS1 epidemic is supposed to have died out in 2005, so it
would be major news if a new virus similar to SARS1 was detected in
humans.</p>

reads are rare before 2020 at the NCBI's Sequence Read Archive</a>
</h3>
<p>J.J. Couey has been saying that sarbecoviruses may have been endemic
in humans before 2020, so the PCR tests for COVID were not necessarily
picking up any novel virus in 2020, since the reason why the
sarbecoviruses were not detected earlier may have been that they were
not tested for earlier.</p>
<p>JC may came up with the theory because in some PCR protocols there is
one primer set which is designed to match other sarbecoviruses in
addition to SARS-CoV-2, and in the Corman-Drosten protocol, there's
actually three primer sets which are all designed to match SARS1 and
some other sarbecoviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2, even though the
third primer set has two different probes where the second probe is
designed to only match SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>However JC's theory is probably wrong, because even though the NCBI's
Sequence Read Archive contains about 11 million of genetic sequencing
runs that were published before 2020, and even though there's many
metagenomic sequencing runs of human lung samples or respiratory
samples, and there's many metagenomic sequencing runs that contain reads
from all kinds of viruses, there's only a handful of runs that were
published before 2020 and that match sarbecoviruses.</p>
<p>The sequencing runs at the SRA have been analyzed with STAT (Sequence
Read Archive Taxonomic Analysis Tool), which counts how many reads have
32-base k-mer matches to different organisms in a taxonomical tree.</p>
<p>The SQL table which shows how many STAT hits each SRA run has is
about 500 GB big, but you can run queries within the table on Google
Cloud Platform.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-bigquery/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-bigquery/</a>]
I ran this query which selected runs with at least one SARS-CoV-2 read
that were published in February 2022 or earlier:</p>
<pre>select * from `nih-sra-datastore.sra.metadata` as m, `nih-sra-datastore.sra_tax_analysis_tool.tax_analysis` as tax where m.acc=tax.acc and tax_id=2697049 and total_count&gt;=1 and releasedate&lt;&quot;2020-03-01&quot; order by releasedate</pre>
<p>I saved the resulting JSON file with one object per line to Google
Drive. For example this downloads the JSON file and displays runs from
2019 with at least 100 matching reads:</p>
<pre>curl -Lso bigquerysars2.json &#39;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1X_8oLCKQ8cgEs5zv5WKBGWVkm4BTJsYK&#39;

<p>There were a total of 1,252 runs from before March 2020 that had at
least 100 reads with a STAT hit for SARS-CoV-2. The oldest runs were
from 2011. I tried downloading the first 100,000 reads from all runs so
that forward and reverse reads are interleaved. I then aligned the reads
against a version of Wuhan-Hu-1 with the poly(A) tail removed:</p>

for a run where they sequenced plankton from the genus Pseudo-nitzschia,
but the longest aligned read was only 17 bases long, and I should've
filtered the reads by length before aligning them. And I got 393 aligned

<p>Earlier I also downloaded SRA runs published before 2020 which had
k-mer matches for other sarbecoviruses and not just SARS-CoV-2, but the
only runs I found which actually contained sarbecoviruses were part of
experiments where lab animals or cell lines were infected with viruses
like SARS1, experiments where sequencers were tested with different
synthetic viral fragments, sequencing projects of bat metagenomes or bat
viromes, and so on. The only runs I found where a sarbecovirus may have
come from an actual human patient were French influenza A samples from
2007-2012 which were contaminated with SARS1.
[<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053621001075>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053621001075</a>]
However the SARS1 reads in the samples matched the lab-created wtic and
ExoN strains, so the samples may have been contaminated in the lab, or
the reads may have been the product of index hopping. Or there may have
actually been an outbreak of SARS1 in France which was caused by a lab
leak.</p>
<p>The only SRA runs I have found that may have been sequenced before
2020 and that contain reads of SARS-CoV-2 are the runs of Antarctic
metagenomic samples that were analyzed by Csabai et al. The samples were
sent for sequencing in December 2019 according to Jesse Bloom's
communication with the Chinese authors who submitted the runs, but even
the Antarctic runs were only published at the SRA in 2021, and it's not
clear if they were sequenced in December 2019 or January 2020.

<blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of Twitter chatter surrounding a rumor that
circulation of #COVID19 in California in fall 2019 has resulted in herd
immunity. This is empirically not the case. COVID-19 was first
introduced into the USA in Jan/Feb 2020.</p>
<p>We have a couple good sources of evidence here: (1) direct testing of
<span class="citation"
data-cites="seattleflustudy">@seattleflustudy</span> samples collected
in Jan and Feb 2020 and (2) phylogenetic evidence showing genetic
relationships of sequenced viruses.</p>
<p>For (1), the <span class="citation"
data-cites="seattleflustudy">@seattleflustudy</span> has gone back and
tested retrospective samples collected between Jan 1 and March 10 in our
research assay. These samples were collected as part of our study of
respiratory infections in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>All samples were from individuals suffering acute respiratory
infection with a subset having influenza-like illness. Individuals with
undiagnosed COVID-19 should be picked up with these symptom
criteria.</p>
<p>We tested 3600 samples collected in Jan 2020 for COVID-19 status and
found zero positives. We tested 3308 samples collected in Feb 2020 and
found a first positive on Feb 21 with a total of 10 samples testing
positive in Feb.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-seattle-flu-study.webp style=max-width:500px>
</div>
<p>Additionally, we confirmed that these samples from acute respiratory
infections from Oct 2019 through Feb 2020 contained a variety of
different viruses including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus
and seasonal coronavirus.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-seattle-flu-study-2.jpg style=max-width:500px>
</div>
<p>As you may know, seasonal coronaviruses are responsible for ~30% of
common colds and are easily distinguished from #SARSCoV2 (the virus
responsible for COVID-19) in molecular assays. There is no chance of
confusion between these in our assay.</p>

<p>Some people claim that PCR positives were found all over the world as
soon as testing started, so they claim the tests were picking up a virus
that had existed in the background for a long time and there was no
spread of a novel virus.</p>
<p>But then why were early cases found in people who had traveled to a
region with COVID? For example in the Netherlands, the first COVID case
was reported on February 27th in a man who was said to have recently
returned from Lombardy.
[<a href=https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/02/27/man-diagnosed-with-coronavirus-covid-19-in-the-netherlands>https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/02/27/man-diagnosed-with-coronavirus-covid-19-in-the-netherlands</a>]
By February 27th there were probably many PCR tests that had already
been performed in the Netherlands, so if the virus had existed on the
background before 2020, then why was it not found earlier? (However in
the statistics published by the Dutch ministry of health, the data for
the number of PCR tests performed each day only starts in June 2020, so
I couldn't check how many tests were performed before February 27th.
[<a href=https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/>https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/</a>])</p>
<p>The first COVID case in Finland was reported on January 29th in a
Chinese tourist who had arrived to Finland from Wuhan.
[<a href=https://yle.fi/a/3-11182855>https://yle.fi/a/3-11182855</a>] It
was the 7th reported COVID case in the EU.</p>
<p>The first reported case in Germany was in a Chinese woman from
Bavaria, who worked for the company Webasto and who had traveled to
Shanghai to meet with her parents who lived in the Wuhan region, and the
next 5 reported cases in Germany were all in people from Bavaria who
worked for Webasto. A German article included the following timeline

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>January 16: A Chinese employee of the Webasto company received a
visit in Shanghai from her parents from the Wuhan region, which is
severely affected by the coronavirus.</li>
<li>January 19-23rd: The woman then visited the Webasto company in
Stockdorf, Bavaria. She showed no symptoms of illness and took part in a
seminar on January 21st, together with a 33-year-old Webasto employee
from nearby Kaufering. Another Chinese employee, who would later be
diagnosed with an infection, is also said to have been present at
meetings.</li>
<li>January 24th: The otherwise healthy man suffered from a sore throat,
chills and muscle aches. The following day he came down with a 39.1
degree C fever and a persistent cough.</li>
<li>January 26th: The Chinese woman tested positive for the coronavirus.
The 33-year-old man, however, felt better in the evening and headed back
to work the following day.</li>
<li>January 27th: The Chinese woman informed the company about her
illness. The man from Kaufering then tested positive, marking the first
case of coronavirus in Germany, and first human-to-human transmission in
Europe.</li>
<li>January 28th: Tests showed that a 27-year-old and a 40-year-old man
as well as a 33-year-old woman had also become infected. All three
worked at Webasto. One of the infected had contact with the Chinese
woman, the others with the 33-year-old man from Kaufering.</li>
<li>January 30th: Late in the evening it was revealed that another
Webasto employee from Siegsdorf had become infected. He had flu-like
symptoms, as did his wife and three children aged between six months and
five years.</li>
<li>January 31st: It turned out that the oldest son of the Siegsdorf
employee had been infected. No viruses could be detected in the
remaining family members - but they also displayed symptoms.</li>

April 2022 in Nauru and December 2022 in Tokelau.

<p>The first two reported cases in Nauru were in two people who had
traveled on the same flight from Australia to Nauru.
[<a href=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/464521/covid-19-in-the-pacific>https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/464521/covid-19-in-the-pacific</a>]
They were tested in quarantine because Nauru had required people who
arrived to the island to remain 14 days in quarantine since March 2020.
But if people who had arrived to Nauru had been tested for COVID since
2020, then why were there no positive tests earlier (or at least no
cases reported by the WHO)?</p>
<p>In CDC's PCR testing data for Marshall Islands, there's 94 test
results listed up to October 9th 2020 but they're all negative, and
after that the number of tests was not updated until April 29th 2021
when there were 2,690 new negative tests and 8 new positive tests added.
However the earliest test was reported on May 7th 2020, so there's at
least 5 months after that when there were no positive tests reported:

were repatriated to the islands, and they included two members of the US
Army garrison who tested positive for COVID.</p>

But people in other labs have similarly done PCR tests for old samples,
and if the samples would've been positive then the people could've also
sequenced the samples, and it would've been huge news if they found
earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2 than the known strains.</p>

<a href=#Isolation_pods_used_to_transport_early_COVID_patients id=Isolation_pods_used_to_transport_early_COVID_patients>Isolation
pods used to transport early COVID patients</a>
</h3>
<p>Hockett has implied that isolation pods like this were used to
transport COVID patients as a form of theater to make the public
audience more afraid of COVID:
[<a href=https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1691897517292556293>https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1691897517292556293</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-isolation-pod.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However in the photo above that Hockett posted on Twitter, the
patient who was being transported inside the isolation pod was the first
reported case of COVID in Nebraska, and she had recently returned to
United States from England.
[<a href=https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Updates-on-Nebraska%E2%80%99s-First-Case-of-Coronavirus-Disease-2019.aspx>https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Updates-on-Nebraska%E2%80%99s-First-Case-of-Coronavirus-Disease-2019.aspx</a>]
So it made sense for the medical staff to use extra precautions because
otherwise they may have been responsible for seeding the COVID pandemic
in Nebraska.</p>
<p>In the photo above, the patient in the isolation pod was being
transported to the University of Nebraska Medical Center. On the website
of the hospital, I found a series of video tutorials where nurses are
taught how to assemble and use an isolation pod unit.
[<a href=https://app1.unmc.edu/nursing/heroes/elc_br_isotran.cfm>https://app1.unmc.edu/nursing/heroes/elc_br_isotran.cfm</a>]
So if the hospital had invested resources in buying an isolation pod and
training their staff on how to use it, and the pod was currently not in
use because they did not yet have other COVID patients, then it made
sense for them to try it out when they had their first COVID
patient.</p>
<p>Hockett also wrote: <span class="quote">"Give us an example of
another <span class="quote">'highly infectious microbe'</span> that
would warrant patient transport in an *isolation pod* like the one

However Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"Isolation devices were
developed in the 1970s for the aerial evacuation of patients with Lassa
fever. In 2015, Human Stretcher Transit Isolator (HSTI) pods were used
for the aerial evacuation of health workers during the Ebola virus
epidemic in Guinea.[3]"</span>

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-isolation-pod-ebola.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>I also found a blog post by a healthcare worker who said that their
hospital started using isolation pods in helicopters and planes that
were used to transport COVID patients, because earlier several crew
members of their transport aircraft had caught COVID, so some of their
helicopters or planes had to be grounded until the crew members could
recover:

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>How are intubated and ventilated Covid-19 patients transported? As a
hospitalist located at Yampa Valley Medical Center in Steamboat Springs,
I have had to intubate and initial mechanical ventilation on a number of
patients infected with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Initially, following the onset of this pandemic, these critically ill
patients were being transported via rotor or fixed wing aircraft to our
larger UCHealth facilities on the Front Range for optimal care by flight
crews donning PPE which included N95 masks, goggles or face shields,
gowns and gloves.</p>
<p>Despite this protective gear, many of the flight crews contracted
Covid, which resulted in some emergency transport services becoming
grounded until crews could recover. A better, safer option for
transporting these patients was needed.</p>
<p><strong>The ISO-POD</strong></p>
<p>Originally developed to transport patients infected with the Ebola
virus, The ISO-POD is negative-pressure patient isolation and transport
system which allows us to safely transport critically ill Covid-19
patients, while simultaneously providing protection to our emergency
personnel. The device has a port which allows for ventilator tubing, IV
lines, and monitoring lines to pass, as well as 12 gloved iris openings
to allow the flight crew staff access to the patient from head to
toe.</p>

<p>There's a total of 1,688 sequences with a collection date before
2009, which are listed in the output above so that the sequences are
sorted by their distance to an early 2009 swine flu sample from Mexico.
Apart from a single sample that's probably mislabeled because its
collection year is listed as 1935, the closest neighbor of the Mexican
sample has only about 94% identity in the HA segment. (The HA protein is
the equivalent of the spike protein in coronaviruses, so it evolves
faster than other proteins because it's exposed to the immune system,
but even though most current human strains of H1N1 developed out of the
2009 swine flu strain, the HA protein of human H1N1 samples from 2023 is
still about 95% identical to the 2009 strain.)</p>
<p>So at least in the NCBI's influenza virus database, apart from the
single sample with a collection year in 1935 that is probably
mislabeled, there's no human sequences from before 2009 that are
anywhere close to the 2009 swine flu strain.</p>
<p>And actually even the closest swine sequences have only about 95%
identity in the HA segment, which makes me suspect that some
gain-of-function work was involved in getting the 2009 swine flu strain
to readapt to a human host. And the reason why I use the word <span
class="quote">"readapt"</span> is that if you look at the pre-2009 swine
sequences of H1N1 that are the most similar to the 2009 strain, they
evolved out of a strain of H1N1 that was fairly close to the Spanish flu
in the 1930s when it's first found in NCBI's influenza virus database,
so the 2009 swine flu strain might basically be a descendant of the
Spanish flu which jumped from humans to pigs and back to humans:</p>

<p>There was a shortage of tests in spring 2020, so on March 25th (in
both UTC and local time) there was an announcement posted on Twitter
that hospitals in New York City had stopped testing patients who do not
require hospitalization: <span class="quote">"Two Queens hospitals are

<p>Usually PCR positivity rates are reported for the whole country and
not for individual cities like New York City, so it's rare to find
positivity rates of 70% in the whole country if the whole country
doesn't get COVID at the same time. However according to OWID's data,
the PCR positivity rate has sometimes climbed above 60% in some
countries like Bolivia, Mongolia, and Taiwan (even though for example
around half of the population of Mongolia is concentrated in
Ulaanbaatar, and around half of the rest of the population still lives a
nomadic lifestyle, so maybe they weren't testing people who lived in
yurts at the steppe, and most of the sedentary population of Mongolia
lives in a single city):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-pcr-positivity-4.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>And additionally if you look at WHO's influenza testing data for a
single country like Germany in the screenshot below, the percentage of
positive PCR tests for influenza viruses has often reached over 60% or
even over 70% during the peak of the flu season (but in individual
cities or regions within a country, you'd of course get even higher
peaks in the percentage of positive tests):

<p>The Elmhurst Hospital in Queens was characterized as the epicenter of
the COVID outbreak in New York City, but Hockett has pointed out that in
spring 2020 Elmhurst had a low number of ICU visits and a low number of
occupied beds:

<p>However a New York Times article published on March 25th said: <span
class="quote">"Elmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, has begun
transferring patients not suffering from coronavirus to other hospitals

<p>According to a New York Times article published in May 2020, elective
surgeries had also been canceled during the COVID peak:
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/hospitals-coronavirus-cases-decline.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/hospitals-coronavirus-cases-decline.html</a>;
read with
<a href=https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome>https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hospitals are eager to restart elective surgery, a needed service
that is also a major revenue generator.</p>
<p>At Elmhurst one recent day, staff members told hospital leaders that
they were reviewing surgeries that had been delayed since March. They
said they had a list of patients who should be operated on this month.
That included cancer and neurosurgery patients who, in a tiered system
released by Medicare in April, fell into categories marked <span
class="quote">"do not postpone."</span></p>
<p>But preparing to resume the procedures is challenging because spaces
reserved for surgery patients - post-anesthesia units, surgical I.C.U.s.
and even operating rooms - were repurposed around the city to treat
those who were critically ill with the virus. On Tuesday, Elmhurst still
had 35 critically ill Covid patients, more than the total I.C.U.
capacity it maintained before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Even if those areas can be freed up, medical institutions have to
create a safe pathway for patients to avoid infection as they enter
hospitals, move to operating rooms, undergo monitoring afterward and
then recover or receive intensive care.</p>

<p>Hockett posted this plot which showed that the number of non-COVID ED
visits was much lower than usual in Bergamo during spring 2020, which
might also explain why ED visits were depressed during the COVID peak in
NYC (but in Hockett's plots for NYC you can't see visits for COVID
disaggregated from non-COVID visits):

</h3>
<p>On March 25th 2020, the New York Times published an article titled
<span class="quote">"13 Deaths in a Day: An <span
class="quote">'Apocalyptic'</span> Coronavirus Surge at an N.Y.C.
Hospital"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html</a>]
The article featured a video from Elmhurst Hospital that was shot by
Colleen Smith, who was described as an emergency room doctor at
Elmhurst. Smith's video showed that there was a long line of patients
outside the hospital, and the article by NYT also said: <span
class="quote">"The line of people waiting outside of Elmhurst to be
tested for the coronavirus forms as early as 6 a.m., and some stay there
until 5 p.m. Many are told to go home without being tested."</span></p>
<p>On March 29th 2020 UTC, someone posted a viral YouTube video titled
<span class="quote">"What Elmhurst Hospital looks like when the news
cameras aren't rolling! #filmyourhospital Part 1/3"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0z8NhxNTaU>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0z8NhxNTaU</a>]
The video showed that there was no longer a line of people waiting to
get tested, which many conspiratards interpreted to mean that the line
was staged for Colleen Smith's video. Many conspiracy theorists thought
that the people outside the hospital were COVID patients who had to wait
outside the hospital because the hospital was so full, and they didn't
realize that the people outside the hospital were waiting to get tested
for COVID in the tents that had been set up outside the hospital.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like the line outside Elmhurst was only staged for
Colleen Smith's video, because I found tweets from several different
days by random people who posted photos of the line outside Elmhurst.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-3-25%20elmhurst%20line&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-3-25%20elmhurst%20line&amp;f=live</a>]
The earliest tweet I found about the line was from March 20th (in both
UTC and local time), when someone tweeted: <span class="quote">"This is
the line for Covid-19 tests at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens this morning.
Police monitoring, car with lights flashing"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/jdavidgoodman/status/1241011394717368325>https://x.com/jdavidgoodman/status/1241011394717368325</a>]
On March 23rd, someone tweeted an image of the line and wrote: <span
class="quote">"line to be tested at elmhurst hospital since 7am it goes
all the way down the block.."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/kingzeek_/status/1242072579977940999>https://x.com/kingzeek_/status/1242072579977940999</a>]</p>
<p>However on March 25th (in both UTC and local time), which was the
same day when the NYT article about Colleen Smith's video was published,
a senator from New York tweeted: <span class="quote">"Two Queens
hospitals are COVID-19 testing sites: NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst
&amp; NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens (also serving as drive-thru testing
site). NYC Health + Hospitals are no longer testing patients who do not
require hospitalization. This is due to an increase in the number of
Coronavirus cases in the city and the dwindling number of tests and
supplies for medical staff."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/SenJoeAddabbo/status/1242856965157634054>https://x.com/SenJoeAddabbo/status/1242856965157634054</a>]
So that might explain why the line went away.</p>
<p>On March 30th (in both UTC and local time), someone tweeted that
there were now less than 10 people standing in line outside Elmhurst.
[<a href=https://x.com/ciaobelladg/status/1244693218031276034>https://x.com/ciaobelladg/status/1244693218031276034</a>]
So if the video that showed no queue was shot on March 29th, maybe the
person who shot the video would've witnessed a small queue building up
again if they waited until the next day.</p>
<p>Some people were saying that the people who stood in line in Colleen
Smith's video were crisis actors because they were all facing away from
the camera (which is something that crisis actors have been accused of
doing on various occasions). But maybe the people were just facing
forwards because they were standing in a line, or maybe the people
standing in line were filmed from the back for privacy reasons. And
there's also a video that was posted on Twitter by someone who was
standing in the line themselves waiting to get tested, but even though
they turned around during the video to film both people before them and
after them, basically none of the faces of the people were visible in
the video, and there appeared to be one or two people who turned their
face away when they noticed that they were being filmed.
[<a href=https://x.com/ruthiwest/status/1244434997513203712>https://x.com/ruthiwest/status/1244434997513203712</a>]</p>
<p>Elmhurst is located in Queens, but if you look at the daily number of
tests performed in Queens County, it remained fairly flat around
2,000-3,000 from March 21st until April 21st, so maybe the reason why
there wasn't a bigger increase in the number of tests performed was that
there was actually a shortage of tests.

<p>An article published on March 20th local time said: <span
class="quote">"The city has begun expanded, appointment-only COVID-19
testing at two Queens hospitals, NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst
(formerly Elmhurst Hospital Center) and NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens
(formerly Queens General Hospital) in Jamaica with cases passing the
1,400 mark in the borough as of Friday morning. [...] The testing at both
Queens hospitals will be inside tents that are similar to the ones used
during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Patients with appointments will
receive an expedited consultation with a primary care physician to
capture their medical history before their sample is collected for
testing."</span>

So it might explain why the first photos of the queue outside Elmhurst I
found on Twitter were from March 20th. And if the patients who went to
get tested at the tent had to discuss their medical history with a
primary care physician, it might explain why the testing took so long
that people had to wait for hours to get tested.</p>
<p>I also found article about the testing tent outside Elmhurst which
was published on March 19th local time, and an update to the article
dated March 20th said that <span class="quote">"the city announced that
the testing tent is now open"</span>.

<p>On April 25th, Governor Cuomo announced that testing capacity had
been increased so that more people were now eligible for testing and
that people were able to get tested at more than 5,000 pharmacies:
[<a href=https://qns.com/2020/04/new-york-covid-19-testing-eligibility-expands-5000-pharmacies-to-collect-samples/>https://qns.com/2020/04/new-york-covid-19-testing-eligibility-expands-5000-pharmacies-to-collect-samples/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As New York state continues increasing its testing capacity, more New
Yorkers will be eligible to get a COVID-19 test - and be able to take
them at their local pharmacy, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on
Saturday.</p>
<p>During his daily briefing, the governor said that the state's 300
labs have ramped up testing to the point where more collection sites are
need to obtain additional samples. To that end, Cuomo has signed an
executive order authorizing more than 5,000 independent pharmacists to
serve as collection sites.</p>
<p>Additionally, the state is relaxing testing criteria, which was
limited to patients seriously ill from coronavirus or those who were
exposed to COVID-19 and are at high risk of becoming infected. Now, the
state will permit first responders, health care workers and various
essential workers to take a COVID-19 test.</p>

<p>Hockett wrote that she knew that people were waiting outside Elmhurst
to get tested in the tents: <span class="quote">"It was people lined up

hospitals seemed to occur two weeks earlier than in other sources:

<p>Hockett used data from Supplementary Table 2 of the paper which is
titled <span class="quote">"Number of new COVID-19 cases per week over
course of the pandemic from March 1st, 2020 to December 1st, 2020, and
the associated rates of intubation and mortality, for all cases (n =

numbers in the table are expressed as weeks after March 1st 2020,
ranging from 1 to 39:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-discrepancy-table.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>However the authors of the paper may have made a mistake in
converting the week numbers to week numbers relative to March 1st,
because March 1st fell on a Sunday so it has a different week number
depending on whether you're using a system of week numbers where the
week starts on Monday or Sunday, and it could for example be that at
some step of their code they used ISO 8601 week numbers where the week
begins on Monday.</p>
<p>The authors of the paper wrote that they used R, but in R the
<code>as.Date</code> function doesn't support converting ISO 8601 week
numbers to dates, because the function only supports the <code>%U</code>
and <code>%W</code> week number formats but not the <code>%V</code>
format, and it's a pain in the ass to write code yourself for converting
ISO 8601 week numbers, so in the past I have erroneously converted data
that used ISO 8601 week numbers using the incorrect week number scheme,
and it's an easy mistake to make:</p>
<pre>&gt; as.Date(&quot;2020 9 0&quot;,&quot;%Y %U %w&quot;) # get first day of week 9 in Sunday-based system
[1] &quot;2020-03-01&quot;
&gt; as.Date(&quot;2020 9 1&quot;,&quot;%Y %W %u&quot;) # get first day of week 9 in Monday-based system
[1] &quot;2020-03-02&quot;
&gt; isoweek=\(year,week,weekday=1){d=as.Date(paste0(year,&quot;-1-4&quot;));d-(as.integer(format(d,&quot;%w&quot;))+6)%%7-1+7*(week-1)+weekday}
&gt; isoweek(2020,9) # get first day of week 9 in ISO 8601
[1] &quot;2020-02-24&quot;
&gt; as.Date(&quot;2020 9 1&quot;,&quot;%Y %V %w&quot;) # `as.Date` doesn&#39;t support `%V` (ISO 8601 week number) so this returns the month and day of the current date (2023-09-08)
[1] &quot;2020-09-08&quot;</pre>
<p>December 1st 2020 fell on a Tuesday, so it was the third day of the
week in a Sunday-based system. The week number of December 1st 2020 is
40 bigger than the week number of March 1st in the <code>%V</code> (ISO
8601) and <code>%W</code> (Monday-based) systems but it's 39 bigger in
the <code>%U</code> (Sunday-based) system:</p>
<pre>$ brew install coreutils
[...]
$ gdate -d2020-3-1 &#39;+%V %U %W %A&#39;
09 09 08 Sunday
$ gdate -d2020-12-1 &#39;+%V %U %W %A&#39;
49 48 48 Tuesday</pre>
<p>In Supplementary Table 2, the last week included in the data is week
39 which is only 38 bigger than the number of the first week, which
would appear to indicate that the partial week that contains December
1st was omitted from the table.</p>
<p>However on the other hand on week 39 in Supplementary Table 2, the
number of new COVID cases was only 73 even though it was 116 on week 38
and it had been increasing steadily for 4 weeks before then, so week 39
might also refer to the incomplete week that consists of November 29th,
November 30th, and December 1st. According to the dataset for the daily
number of COVID deaths by county that was published on the GitHub
account of the New York Times, the daily number of new COVID cases in
New York City was increasing at a fairly constant pace in late November
and early December, so if the last week of data included in
Supplementary Table 2 would be a complete week, it probably shouldn't
have a much smaller number of cases than the second-last week (unless
for example a large number of cases were omitted on the last week
because of a registration delay):</p>

<p>However if week 39 is the week that contains December 1st, then week
1 would be the week that starts on March 8th if the week starts on
Sunday or on March 9th if the week starts on Monday. Which would explain
why the deaths would be shifted by a single week. But I don't know why
the deaths would be shifted by two weeks though.</p>
<p>Another reason why the week numbers in the Parish et al. paper may
have been off by one could be that in the <code>%U</code> strftime
format where the week begins on Sunday, the first week of the year is
week zero, so for example <code>date -d2020-1-1 +%U</code> prints
<code>00</code>, but for example CDC WONDER uses a week number scheme
where the week begins on Sunday but the first week of the year is week
1. (I noticed it when I got the wrong result when I tried to use the
<code>%U</code> format to convert week numbers from CDC WONDER to
dates.)</p>

a similar sharp spike in deaths was not seen elsewhere:

<p>However according to OWID's data, for example in Macao the excess
mortality went from 11% in November 2022 to 266% the next month, 256%
the next month, and 1% the next month. And in Hong Kong, the excess
mortality went from -1% in January 2022 to 33% the month, 169% the
month, 33% the next month, and 3% the next month. Both Macao and Hong
Kong had almost no excess deaths or COVID deaths before 2022.</p>
<p>Many other countries have had similar short-lived spikes in excess
mortality that peaked at around 150% or higher, and usually the spikes
in excess mortality coincided with a spike in PCR positivity rate

I asked her if she has statistics for every city and region of Ecuador,
because according to the data from the World Mortality Database that is
used by OWID, Ecuador had almost 400% excess mortality on the week
ending April 5th, so individual cities in Ecuador necessarily had even
higher excess mortality since some cities are going to be above the
nationwide average and some cities are going to be below the nationwide
average. And I asked her if she has weekly data for French Polynesia or
Macao, because OWID has only monthly data for French Polynesia and Macao
but they both had almost 300% excess mortality during an entire month,
so their weekly peaks in excess mortality had to be even higher since
some weeks are going to above the monthly average and some weeks are
going to be below the monthly average. Here you can see the countries
and jurisdictions with the highest weekly or monthly excess mortality at
OWID (where there's generally monthly data for the jurisdictions where
the date in the last column is on the last day of the month):</p>

<p>A paper about excess deaths in Italy said: <span class="quote">"Some
provinces showed staggering increases, with the percentage excess in
Bergamo reaching 858.7% (95% eCI: 771.9 to 969.5%) in the week of 18-24
March (see Supplementary Data, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online)."</span>
[<a href=https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/49/6/1909/5923437>https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/49/6/1909/5923437</a>]
So there might also be some cities in Ecuador or Gujarat which would
surpass Bergamo.</p>
<p>The plot below shows modeled daily excess deaths in Ecuador.
[<a href=https://www.ijidonline.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1201-9712%2820%2932567-4>https://www.ijidonline.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1201-9712%2820%2932567-4</a>]
The peak daily number of excess deaths from all causes was about 900,
and if you estimate the total daily deaths visually for the period
between three days before and three days after the peak, it would be
around <code>665+860+825+915+750+775+685 = 5475</code>. However the peak
is on April 4th which was a Saturday, so the number of excess deaths
would be much lower both for the week that ended on Sunday April 5th and
the week that ended on Sunday April 12th (which demonstrates a problem
with looking at weekly mortality data to determine which countries had
the highest peak in excess mortality):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-ecuador.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Based on the pre-pandemic trend, Ecuador would've had about 4.93
deaths per 1,000 inhabitants in 2020 and the population of Ecuador
would've been about 17.6 million in 2020, so if there would've been no
seasonal variation in the weekly number of deaths, the number of deaths
per week would've been about <code>4.93*17600/(365.24/7)</code> or about
1,663. So 5,475 deaths would be equivalent to about 330% excess deaths.
However the percentage of excess deaths would be lower both on the week
ending April 5th and on the week ending April 12th (even though OWID
actually reports 387% excess mortality for Ecuador on the week ending
April 5th).</p>
<p>From the plot below which is from another paper about excess deaths
in Ecuador, you can see that the total excess mortality in 2020 was
about 134% in the province of Santa Elena and about 90% in the province
of Guayas, so some cities within those provinces may have had higher
weekly excess mortality than Bergamo:

<p>A paper about excess deaths in Italy said: <span class="quote">"In
the first 6 months of 2020, an 11.1% excess mortality was observed in
Italy, and an almost 50% excess in Lombardy, the most affected
region."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809978/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809978/</a>]
Bergamo is only the fourth-largest city of Lombardy, and other cities in
Lombardy had lower excess deaths than Bergamo.</p>
<p>From the plot below you can see that the Italian province of Cremona
had almost as high excess mortality as the province of Bergamo, so the
maximum weekly excess mortality was probably also higher in Cremona or
one of its municipalities than in NYC:

However like at CDC Wonder, the number of deaths in the dataset is
hidden for rows with 1-9 deaths, so is not possible to calculate the
monthly percentage of deaths in younger age groups correctly for states
with a low number of COVID deaths. But during each month from March 2020
until January 2023, New York City had a sufficient number of COVID
deaths that it is possible to calculate the percentage of COVID deaths
in ages 0-54 out of all COVID deaths. The percentage was about 14% in
March 2020 and about 10% in April 2020, but the percentage wasn't even
the highest in spring 2020 because it was about 16% in August 2020 and
about 19% in August 2021:</p>

<p>The heatmap below shows that the percentage of UCD COVID deaths in
ages 0 to 54 out of all ages was about 14% in NYC in March 2020, but it
was about 22% in Arizona and 21% in Alabama. And it was even higher in
many states during the Delta wave in 2021. During the Delta wave there
were still many unvaccinated people who had not yet acquired natural
immunity, so vaccines gave a large immunization advantage to the older
age groups where a larger percentage of people were vaccinated than in
younger age groups. By 2022 the percentage of COVID deaths in young age
out of all age groups had fallen down to a much lower level, but I
believe it's because unvaccinated people gained natural immunity over
time (because the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated COVID ASMR was
also lower in 2022 than 2021):</p>

<p>Hockett also posted the tweet below which showed the number of COVID
deaths in ages 35-54 in NYC, and she asked <span class="quote">"Why did
New York City hospitals see more COVID-19 deaths among younger adults
than anyplace else in the world?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1701623517207273775>https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1701623517207273775</a>]</p>

<p>Hockett's plot showed that the peak in COVID deaths among ages 35-54
was on the week ending April 11th, when there was around 400-500% excess
mortality. But in a paper which looked at the number of excess deaths in
90 municipalities in the Indian state of Gujarati, there was a week in
April 2021 when there was about 900% weekly excess mortality in the age
group 40-64 and about 400% excess mortality in the age group 20-39:
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10021770/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10021770/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-gujarat-age-groups.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The population of the state of Gujarat is about 60 million, so even
in absolute terms, the peak weekly number of excess deaths among younger
adults was probably higher in Gujarat than in New York City.</p>
<p>In the tweet below Hockett indicated that it was somehow anomalous
that the peak weekly excess mortality in NYC was about 569% in ages
20-69 and about 694% in ages 70 and over, since she would've expected
older age groups to have much higher excess mortality:
[<a href=https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1702380430131937449>https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1702380430131937449</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-new-york-under-70.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However the excess mortality caused by COVID isn't necessarily the
highest in the oldest age groups. For example according to the plot
below, in Ecuador there was higher excess mortality in the age group
60-69 than in age groups 70-79 or 80 and above, and the 60-69 age group
accounts for a large percentage of all deaths in people between the ages
of 0 and 69:

<p>The output above shows that the set of mutations
<code>C241T,C3037T,C14408T,A23403G</code> is found in a total of almost
3,000 sequences from 2020 even though it's found in only 7 sequences
from March 2020 where the city field is New York City. The four
mutations consist of D614G and the mutations that are usually found
together with D614G, and the PANGO clade which includes the four
mutations is B.1, but most strains which circulated in New York City in
March 2020 had already acquired additional mutations in addition to the
four basic mutations of B.1. The four B.1 mutations are found in all ten
mutations sets shown above, with the exception of C3037T which is
missing from one set.</p>
<p>The set of mutations on the 5th place above appears to be almost
exclusive to New York City, because it appears a total of 9 times among
the GISAID samples but 8 of the samples are from New York City and the
9th one is from New Jersey. The mutation set has the same 9 mutations as
the mutation set on the second place, but it has the additional
mutations A8031G and C8890T. There's only a total of 10 samples on
GISAID with both of the mutations and a collection date in 2020, and all
samples are from New York or New Jersey, and the oldest sample has a
collection date on March 15th, and the newest sample which has three
extra mutations also has the latest collection date:</p>

<p>Hockett says that viral spread has not been proven, but if the virus
doesn't spread from one person to another, then how are they able to
fabricate these local clusters of mutations which appear in a small
geographic area and soon die out? If they were able to achieve the
outbreak in NYC by <span class="quote">"spraying clones"</span> like
J.J. Couey says, then did their spray bottle contain an ever-changing
mixture of variants so that it simulated the natural emergence of new
mutations? So if they had different spray bottles for different cities,
then did they insert A8031G and C8890T to their spray bottle for New
York City around mid-March, and in late March they also added T22367A,
C29205T, and C29284T?</p>
<p>Out of the ten most common sets of mutations in the samples from New
York City from March 2020, this set was on the second place:

Out of a total of 248 samples with the mutation set, the earliest
samples are from New York City, but a bit later there's also samples
from Ontario and Quebec (which are both about 500 km away from NYC) and
from Israel (which has a large number of people traveling to and from
New York City):</p>

<p>In the output of my code which showed the most common mutation sets
in New York City in March 2020, the mutation set on the fourth spot is
only found in USA and Quebec, but the earliest sample from Quebec has a
collection date 11 days later than the earliest sample from NYC. It
appears to contradict Rancourt's claim that the virus did not spread
from USA to Canada, especially since the collection date of the sample
from Quebec is only three days after the US-Canada border was closed on
March 21st:</p>

<p>In March 2023, OWID switched to using data for COVID deaths and cases
from the WHO instead of Johns Hopkins University.
[<a href=https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/2784>https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/2784</a>]
WHO includes Macao as part of China but Johns Hopkins doesn't, so you
can see the daily number of COVID deaths in Macao from the old version
of OWID's data.
[<a href=https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data-old.csv>https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data-old.csv</a>]
During the wave of deaths in winter 2022-2023, the first COVID death was
on December 17th, the last death was on February 3rd, and the
penultimate death was on January 26th. So all COVID deaths except the
final death took place within a 41-day period. Similar data is visible
at Worldometers, even though it also includes one death on December
14th:
[<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china-macao-sar/>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china-macao-sar/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-6-weeks-2.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>And also in Ecuador in spring 2020, the first week with a clear
increase in excess mortality was the week ending March 22nd, but about 6
or 7 weeks later the spike in deaths had already passed (even though the
deaths did not return to the baseline until later in 2020).</p>
<p>The curve for the first wave of H1N1 deaths in Thailand also has
similar shape as the curve for COVID deaths in NYC, where it goes from
zero to maximum in about 6 weeks and then it takes about twice as many
weeks to fall back close to zero:

<p>Hockett tweeted the video shown below from a paper by Reichberg et
al. titled <span class="quote">"Rapid Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
Greater New York Metropolitan Area: Geolocation, Demographics,
Positivity Rates, and Hospitalization for 46 793 Persons Tested by
Northwell Health"</span>. The video showed that early COVID cases in New
York mostly appeared around NYC but later the cases spread to the
eastern part of Long Island and north of NYC, but Hockett said that it
was because of an expansion of testing and not an expansion of the
virus:
[<a href=https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1687453210665996288>https://x.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1687453210665996288</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-ny-spread.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However if you look at the daily PCR positivity rate in different
counties of New York State, it reached above 50% for three consecutive
days first in Queens, then in Kings and Bronx, then in Nassau (which is
the county of Long Island that is between NYC and Suffolk), then in
Suffolk (which is the county of Long Island that is east of Nassau), and
then in Rockland (which is north of NYC):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-ny-spread-2.webp width=1100>
</div>
<p>Hockett also mentioned that Reichberg et al. wrote: <span
class="quote">"Our data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 incidence emerged rapidly
and almost simultaneously across a broad demographic population in the
region. These findings support the premise that SARS-CoV-2 infection was
widely distributed prior to virus testing availability."</span>
[<a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640030/>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640030/</a>]
However from my heatmap above, you can see that on the first days of
March there were days with 0% positive PCR tests in many counties of
NYC, and the PCR positivity rate in NYC didn't reach the peak until the
last days of March or the first days of April.</p>
<p>For example in Bronx there's a total of 29 tests listed between March
1st and March 7th but zero of them are positive, and on March 10th
there's 47 tests listed but zero of them are positive:

<p>In Rensselaer County in upstate New York, there were 110 tests

<p>So if there was no novel virus and the PCR tests were simply picking
up some virus which had existed in the background before 2020, then why
was the percentage of positive PCR tests so low during the first days of
March 2020? And why did the virus disappear after May 2020 so that the
PCR positivity rate fell back to about 10% or less?</p>
<p>Here you can also see an animation of how the area of counties with a
high PCR positivity rate gradually expanded from NYC to the counties
north of NYC and to Suffolk County
(<a href=stat.html#Plot_PCR_positivity_rate_on_a_map>R code</a>):</p>

<p>Hockett also posted the tweet below, but according to my heatmap
above, the percentage of positive PCR tests first reached above 50% on
March 24th in Kings County but on March 28th in New York County. Kings
County is the county of Brooklyn and New York County is the county of
Manhattan:</p>

<p>This plot also shows that in Seneca County in upstate New York, there
were 73 tests performed before March 30th but they were all negative,
and the first positive result only came on March 30th (at least
according to the testing dataset which I used, which might be missing
some tests):</p>

<p>You can use CDC WONDER to get weekly all-cause deaths by county from
2018 up to present.

Click the <span class="quote">"I Agree"</span> button, and in section 1,
set <span class="quote">"Group Results By"</span> to <span
class="quote">"Residence County"</span> and set <span class="quote">"And
By"</span> to <span class="quote">"MMWR Week"</span> (MMWR is Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report). In section 2, set the residence state to a
single state or up to about 5 states, because otherwise there's an error
that the number of rows returned is too high. And in section 8, check
<span class="quote">"Export Results"</span> and click <span
class="quote">"Send"</span>.</p>
<p>However one serious limitation of CDC WONDER is that for privacy
reasons it suppresses the count of deaths for counties with 1-9 deaths.
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html</a>]
And in order for a county to have 10 or more deaths each week, its
population needs to be around 50-100 thousand or higher.</p>
<p>Among the counties where the population was 100,000 or higher and the
number of deaths was 10 or more each week in 2018-2020, I wasn't able to
find any county where the maximum weekly percentage of excess deaths in
2020 was higher than in the counties of New York City. Even though it's
interesting that the total percentage of excess deaths in 2020 was the
highest in Imperial County of California and not in any county of New
York State or New Jersey:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/cdc-wonder-excess-mortality-per-week-us-counties.webp width=1200>
</div>
<p>In order to see the weekly number of deaths in smaller counties, you
can look at the dataset for COVID deaths by county which was published
by the New York Times.
[<a href=https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2020.csv>https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2020.csv</a>]
On the week ending April 12th when NYC had the highest number of COVID
deaths, the number of COVID deaths per capita was almost as high in
Mitchell County in Georgia. And later in August 2020 or December 2020,
some small counties in southern states had higher COVID deaths per
capita than NYC in spring 2020
(<a href=stat.html#Make_a_heatmap_of_weekly_COVID_deaths_per_capita_in_U_S_counties>R
code</a>):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nyt-deaths-per-week-2.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>In order to get data for smaller counties from CDC WONDER, I looked
at monthly data instead of weekly data, and now when I sorted counties
by the average percentage of excess deaths in 2020, the highest-ranking
county of New York City was Bronx which only came on 10th place. The
highest monthly excess mortality in 2020 was 550% in Queens, but there
was also about 393% excess mortality in July 2020 in Macon, Tennessee,
and there was about 380% excess mortality in December 2020 in Ray,
Missouri. However there's something weird going on, because for example
in Ray, Missouri, there was also 774% excess mortality in December
2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/cdc-wonder-excess-mortality-per-month-us-counties.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>It could be that some small county had high excess deaths in 2020 if
they had a new old folks home open in 2020 and they had a lot of old
people moving in from other counties. Because in the plot above, I was
not looking at age-standardized mortality or even CMR but simply the
excess number of deaths. Some counties might also have increased deaths
if they have merged with other counties so their population has
increased, or if a lot of new people have moved in to the county for
some other reason. So it might be better to look at CMR, but CDC WONDER
doesn't seem to return population numbers for weekly or monthly data but
only for yearly data.</p>
<p>When I compared 2020 and 2021 population numbers in yearly data from
CDC WONDER, the highest increase in population was only about 33%
though:</p>

<p>Jessica Hockett has been saying that the deaths attributed to COVID
were not caused by a virus, because for example Chicago had much lower
excess mortality than NYC or Bergamo, so she has been asking why the
virus would behave in such a different way in different cities:</p>

<p>However if there's some kind of a long-tail distribution for the

the distribution you'd expect to find outlier cities that had a very
high number of COVID deaths during a single month.</p>
<p>You can download data for monthly number of deaths by county from CDC
WONDER: <a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html.><a
href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html"
class="uri">https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>.</a>
Click the <span class="quote">"I Agree"</span> button, in section 1 set
<span class="quote">"Group Results By"</span> to <span
class="quote">"Residence County"</span> and set <span class="quote">"And
By"</span> to <span class="quote">"Month"</span>. In section 2, select
the first 30 states from the list of residence states, because otherwise
there's an error that the number of rows returned is too high. In
section 8, check <span class="quote">"Export Results"</span>, increase
the timeout to 15 minutes, and click <span class="quote">"Send"</span>.
And then repeat the procedure for the rest of the states.</p>
<p>Then if you calculate the excess percent of deaths for each US county
during each month of 2020, it will end up having a long-tail
distribution like this, where there's a handful of months when some
county had over 300% excess mortality:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/cdc-wonder-monthly-distribution.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>Now I haven't ruled out the possibility that the number of deaths in
NYC was artificially inflated, but in the plot above if you only look at
the part of the plot with under 200% excess deaths and you ignore rest
of the plot, the distribution looks like there would be at least a
couple of counties that had over 300% excess deaths during some month of
2020.</p>
<p>In the plot below, I took excess mortality percentages for each
country at OWID from 2020 to 2023, I interpolated it to daily data and
calculated monthly averages of the daily data, and I counted the number
of occurrences for each percentage value rounded to an integer. So then
as expected, I got a similar distribution as for the data from CDC
WONDER (even though the maximum percentage was lower because I looked at
country-level data instead of county-level data and I looked at monthly
and not weekly data):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/owid-monthly-distribution.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>The next plot shows that there's also a similar distribution for
weekly excess mortality across NUTS 2 regions of Europe. The five
highest percentages are all for the Spanish regions of Madrid or
Castile-La Mancha. But Lombardy is only ranked 6th and 7th, because the
city of Bergamo accounts for only about 1% of the population of Lombardy
(even though the province of Bergamo accounts for about 10% of the
population of Lombardy):</p>

<p>Hockett tweeted that there was <span class="quote">"no sudden spread
of a deadly novel coronavirus"</span> but that there was a <span
class="quote">"sudden spread of testing, accompanied by iatrogenic
measures and policies"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1711722691802058798>https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1711722691802058798</a>]</p>
<p>But if there was no viral spread, then why are there clusters of
neighboring US counties that had high excess mortality during 1-3
adjacent months in 2020? Were neighboring counties told to adopt the
<span class="quote">"iatrogenic measures and policies"</span> for one or
two months and then drop them later? For example from the GIF file below
you can see that in July 2020, there were three neighboring counties in
the southernmost point of Texas which all had around 250-300% excess
mortality, so were those counties told to implement some kind of special
iatrogenic protocols which were not given to counties in other parts of
Texas?</p>
<div>
<img src=i/usexcess.gif width=900>
</div>
<p>I made the plot above using the <code>usmap</code> R package:

<p>The three counties at the southernmost point of Texas were Hidalgo,
Cameron, and Starr, which according to my calculation were the three
counties with the highest excess mortality in Texas in July 2020 (but in
order to calculate the trend for excess mortality correctly, I had to
exclude small counties which had less than 10 deaths during any month in
2018-2020, since CDC WONDER hides the number of deaths during months
with less than 10 deaths):</p>

</h3>
<p>In the comment section of a Substack article where Hockett questioned
the number of deaths in New York City in spring 2020, someone from
Brooklyn posted the following comment:
[<a href=https://pandauncut.substack.com/p/does-new-york-city-2020-make-any/comments>https://pandauncut.substack.com/p/does-new-york-city-2020-make-any/comments</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I have to add to to your scholarly work is the experience of
having been on the ground here in Brooklyn. I must say that tragically I
do not believe the numbers are wrong for NYC. I lived through an
extremely traumatic spring that year - I was 9 months pregnant and
continuously in terrible fear, as so many friends, relatives, neighbors,
and friends-of-friends and friends-of-relatives, etc were on our prayer
lists, many of them hospitalized, on a respirator, etc. I cannot begin
to describe what it was like! I can send you my prayer list if you would
like to see it. There were dozens of people on it. Many of them did not
make it. And some of them were young!! My husband lost his friend from
our synagogue, who lived in our neighborhood. He was around 50. We lost
a dear family friend, also 50. We lost one of our Rabbis. He wasn't very
old. We lost my husband's aunt. We lost a venerated community member, a
Holocaust survivor we knew, author of <span class="quote">"The Youngest
Partisan."</span> There are SO many more. It wasn't just in NYC,
actually, but also nearby religious Jewish communities, such as Monsey
NY and Lakewood NJ. I was told that a total of ONE THOUSAND Orthodox
Jews on the East Coast died in the one month between Purim and Passover
2020. A Jewish magazine (Mishpacha) published their bios, and the
community is close-knit, so I know they have to be real people.
Maimonides Hospital, which I'm glad you mentioned, became known as a
death trap. We heard about an Orthodox Jewish man who walked in on his
own two feet, on the Sabbath, wearing his Sabbath clothing, and within
hours was in a body bag. HOW did this happen? I don't know! I heard
there were protests outside the hospital because the community realized
that people were being murdered.</p>
<p>There was a refrigerated truck parked outside Maimonides to hold the
bodies. I don't think it was just for show, because I heard that the
Jewish funeral homes had to deal with a massive amount of deaths. And I
know that was true. We kept on hearing about one death in the religious
community after another, nonstop. They were real people. We heard their
names. A massive amount of families had to sit shiva when Passover
ended. And an organization I spoke to later on was helping the hundreds
of new orphans.</p>
<p>It was so horrible that when I finally dared to emerge into the world
(probably in May), I was kind of surprised to see community members
walking around in Borough Park - wow, there were survivors!</p>

<p>Hockett tweeted an obituary which said that <span class="quote">"Kyra
Michelle Swartz, age 33, died unexpectedly on April 5, 2020, at her home
in New York City from COVID-19"</span>, and Hockett was questioning if
the 33-year-old actually died of COVID.

Someone replied to the tweet: <span class="quote">"Went to elementary,
middle, and high school with her. Family friends as well. My dad did
road biking with her parents."</span> Then Hockett replied: <span
class="quote">"Then you should want the truth about her death - and
about what actually happened in NYC in those weeks. New York City is a
global outlier with young deaths attributed to COVID in this
period."</span> And the Twitter user replied: <span class="quote">"The
story you posted is very similar to what everyone heard. She lived
alone, tested positive, was told to go back to her apartment alone, and
then I think after a couple days her parents couldn't reach her. And she
was found dead."</span> And then Hockett replied: <span
class="quote">"Tested positive where? You're saying she went to ED or
outpatient facility and was tested?"</span> And the other user replied:
<span class="quote">"I remember hearing something of that. But this was
all second and third hand. I can probably get you in touch with friends
or family of hers. I was not a close friend."</span> And then Hockett
replied: <span class="quote">"You sound pretty <span
class="quote">'sus'</span> to me :)"</span>. But then as evidence that
he knew the woman who died of COVID, the Twitter user posted her
yearbook photo and a screenshot which showed that he had 28 mutual
friends with her on Facebook. However after Hockett didn't post any
further replies, he replied: <span class="quote">"I thought I provided
solid evidence that I was telling the truth. Not sure why you stopped
replying. I would have thought you would want this type of
info."</span></p>
<p>A local newspaper article about the woman said: <span
class="quote">"Swartz had been sick at home for about 10 days, unable to
travel to see her parents or vice versa, before she was found in her
apartment. The severity of Swartz's COVID-19 symptoms are unclear. But
in general, patients with mild symptoms are encouraged to ride out the
illness at home - away from hospitals that are currently overrun with
more critically-ill, older patients."</span>

<p>In a reply to one of Hockett's tweets, someone asked if there was a
pandemic at Guam:
[<a href=https://x.com/TheBrettDarken/status/1747419041336098955>https://x.com/TheBrettDarken/status/1747419041336098955</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-guam-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>According to the sources I looked up, Guam had a population of
168,801 and a yearly death rate of about 7.34 per thousand, which
results in a weekly number of about 24 deaths. However according to
OWID, the weekly number of COVID deaths in Guam peaked at 17 on the week
ending September 12th 2021. The periods with high COVID deaths also had
a high PCR positivity rate:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-guam-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>A report about COVID at Guam said: <span class="quote">"Though
overall vaccination coverage in Guam is high with 93.5% of the eligible
population (age ≥5) vaccinated as of 1/22/2022, among individuals who
died of COVID-19 in Guam in 2021 with known vaccination status, over 80%
were not fully vaccinated."</span>

According to Table 1 of the report, there were 132 deaths in people with
a known vaccination status but 102 of the people were unvaccinated,
which is about 77%:</p>

</h3>
<p>Hockett pointed out that there was a large number of positive PCR
tests in NYC in late 2020 even though excess mortality remained low:
[<a href=https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1750299283616579776>https://x.com/Wood_House76/status/1750299283616579776</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-nypcr-1.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However there was a much larger number of tests being performed in
late 2020 than in spring 2020, so the percentage of positive PCR tests
wasn't that high in late 2020. And excess mortality also began to rise
in November 2020 before the vaccines were rolled out:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-nypcr-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>My plot above also shows that in June 2021 when the moving average
for excess mortality was negative, the moving average of the PCR
positivity rate fell below 1%. If PCR tests have a huge rate of false
positives like some people claim, then why are there periods when
there's less than 1% positive tests in entire states or entire
countries? And how are the health authorities able to rig the tests so
that periods of low PCR positivity coincide with periods of low excess
mortality?</p>
<p>An article about a COVID-19 infection survey done by the ONS said:
<span class="quote">"We know the specificity of our test must be very
close to 100% as the low number of positive tests in our study over the
summer of 2020 means that specificity would be very high even if all
positives were false. For example, in the six-week period from 31 July
to 10 September 2020, 159 of the 208,730 total samples tested positive.
Even if all these positives were false, specificity would still be above
99.9%."</span>

<p>However the Snohomish County man may have actually been the
progenitor of lineage nu which is found in over 3000 submissions at
GISAID. In the WA1 sequence which is supposed to be the sample from the
Snohomish County man, there are 3 mutations from the Wuhan-Hu-1
reference genome, but all three mutations are ancestral in the sense
that they are shared with RaTG13 and BANAL-52. WA1 is identical to the
proCoV-2 sequence which Kumar et al. constructed as the hypothetical
ancestor of known strains of SARS-CoV-2. Kumar et al. named one
sublineage of proCoV2 lineage nu, which has two additional mutations
from proCoV2/WA1: nu1 (A17858G) and nu2 (C17747T).</p>
<p>On GISAID most of the earliest samples which contain both mutations
are from the King or Snohomish counties of Washington State (which are
neighboring counties in the Seattle metropolitan area):</p>

<p>However it could of course be that there were multiple transmissions
of proCoV2/WA1 to Washington State, so Snohomish County man is not
necessarily the progenitor of the substrains of lineage A in Washington
State. But the possibility remains that he may have even seeded hundreds
of thousands of COVID infections in the United States.</p>

otherwise. Macao and French Polynesia both had nearly 300% excess deaths

<p>Hockett's table shows that in ages 25-54 in March to May 2020, the
number of COVID deaths was 1,937 in NYC which was about 34% of the
number of deaths in the rest of the US.</p>
<p>When I searched CDC WONDER for deaths where underlying cause of death
was COVID (U07.1), the month of death was March to May 2020, and the
county of residence was one of the 5 counties of NYC, I got 1,886 total
deaths: <a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html.><a
href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html"
class="uri">https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>.</a> I
don't know why my figure was lower than Hockett's figure, because when I
switched to multiple cause of death COVID, the number of deaths
increased to 2,028 which was higher than Hockett's figure. But it might
be if Hockett got the number of COVID deaths from NYC Health instead of
CDC WONDER like the caption of the table seems to indicate.</p>
<p>But anyway, when I looked at the whole of 2020, I got 1,651 deaths in
NYC which was about 9% of the number of deaths in the rest of the US.
And from 2020 up to the present, I got 2,658 deaths in NYC which was
only about 3.2% of the number of deaths in the rest of the US. But
according to the population figures cited in Hockett's table, the
population of NYC in ages 25-54 was about 3.1% of the rest of the US
population in ages 25-54, so the total CMR in 2020-2024 was close to the
same in NYC and the rest of the US:</p>

<p>In the table above I multiplied Hockett's population sizes with the
number of days in each time interval, and I calculated the CMR values as
deaths per 365,000 person-days. In the last column the baseline for the
excess CMR in NYC is the CMR in the rest of the US.</p>
<p>Contrary to Hockett's claims, NYC didn't have an unusually high
percentage of COVID deaths in young age groups out of all ages. But NYC
just got hit by COVID earlier than most of the rest of the US.</p>
<p>In the red states that had a low percentage of vaccinated people in
young age groups relative to all age groups, there was also a high
percentage of COVID deaths in young age groups relative to all age
groups.</p>
<p>In 2020-2023, the total COVID CMR in ages 25-54 was about 20.6 in NYC
(<code>3162/3838849/4*100000</code>). But it was over 20 in most states
in the southern census region, and the highest CMR was about 43.1 in New
Mexico (from <code>1348/3128270*100000</code> using CDC WONDER's
population figures):</p>

<p>In the plot below I looked at all COVID deaths and not only COVID
deaths in public hospitals, and I included the whole New York State
instead of only New York City. The percentage of COVID deaths in ages
0-64 was only about 29% in New York State in March 2020, but it was
higher in 9 other states. During the Delta wave the percentage was about
40-50% in southern states:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hockett-u65-2.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>The reason why 2021 had a high percentage of COVID deaths in younger
age groups could be because in 2021 young people were less likely to be
vaccinated than old people. And the reason why the percentage fell back
down in 2022 could be because many unvaccinated people had acquired
natural immunity by 2022.</p>
<p>In the plot of Czech data below where I divided an age-standardized
hospitalization rate in unvaccinated people with the rate in vaccinated
people, the ratio between the two rates gradually got lower over time,
which might be if unvaccinated people gradually acquired natural
immunity over time:</p>

<p>The paper where Corman et al. described their PCR protocol said:

<p>Wikipedia's timeline of the COVID pandemic included the following
entry under December 29th:

<blockquote>
<p>Wuhan Central Hospital received a report from Beijing Boao Medical
Laboratory stating that their sample (obtained 27 December) contained
SARS coronavirus.[11] At the time, the laboratory only obtained a short
partial sequence, which was rapidly shared with Vision Medicals, so that
Vision Medicals could confirm that the sequence was SARS-CoV-2, i.e.,
roughly identical to the one they obtained 3 days before, and relatively
distant to the original SARS coronavirus.[19]</p>
<p>Several doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital shared the test report on
social media in discussions mainly aimed at colleagues.[11] As referred
to by Caixin Online, from the social media account of Li Wenliang, it is
stated that there are seven cases of SARS at Wuhan Central Hospital, all
connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.[11]</p>

<p>The Chinese word for SARS is 非典, so you can search Twitter for
<code>非典 until:2020-1-1</code> to find early tweets about COVID where
COVID was connected to SARS. There were dozens of tweets like this
posted on December 31st or 30th UTC:

<p>However according to WHO's excess mortality data, there were also
several Latin American and Asian countries that had over 50% excess
mortality during March, April, or May 2020. Here only the month with the
highest excess mortality percent is listed for each country:</p>

<p>I used WHO's dataset of monthly excess mortality in 2020 and 2021,
which uses reported data for developed countries but modeled data for
some developing countries.
[<a href=https://www.who.int/data/sets/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-modelled-estimates>https://www.who.int/data/sets/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-modelled-estimates</a>]
WHO's dataset also includes countries that are missing excess mortality
data at OWID, like India and China and sub-Saharan African
countries.</p>
<p>Here's a heatmap of the same dataset published by the WHO, where you
can see that for example in Nicaragua the excess mortality jumped up
from about 2% in April 2020 to about 170% in May 2020:</p>

<p>However Canada had about 24% excess mortality in April 2020, and the
major spikes in excess mortality in Canada occurred at roughly the same
time as in the United States

<p>In the code above I selected samples whose mutation set is a subset
of the 22-mutation set that is found in British Columbia, and I
displayed the earliest sample for each number of mutations from
Wuhan-Hu-1. The samples displayed do not represent the actual chain of
variants which led to the 22-mutation strain, and actually there's
multiple possible chains which may have led to the strain, even though
in each chain the ancestors with over 7 mutations are found exclusively
in the USA.</p>
<p>In March 2020 there were also sublineages of B.1 which were first
found in New York but which were later found in Quebec or Ontario:
<a href=#Mutations_of_GISAID_samples_from_New_York_City_in_March_2020>#Mutations_of_GISAID_samples_from_New_York_City_in_March_2020</a>.</p>
<p>Kumar et al. reconstructed a hypothetical ancestor of known strains
of SARS-CoV-2, which they named proCoV2.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523107/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523107/</a>]
It is identical to the WA1 sample which is supposed to have been
collected from the first known COVID case in the US, who has become
known as the Snohomish County Man.</p>
<p>Kumar et al. named one sublineage WA1/proCoV2 lineage nu, which
includes the nu1 mutation A17858G and the nu2 mutation C17747T. The
oldest lineage nu samples on GISAID are all from Washington State.</p>
<p>When I searched for lineage nu samples from Canada that had the
highest number of mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1, I found one sample which
has the 3 WA1 mutations, 2 additional lineage nu mutations, and 6 other
mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1. It is only found in a single sample in
Manitoba, but its ancestors with 6 or more mutations from Wuhan-Hu are
found exclusively in the United States (so it looks like another
instance of the virus spreading from the United States to Canada):</p>

B.1.279 strain on GISAID</a>

<p>After the lockdown was put in place, there emerged strains which were
restricted to a single country, like for example B.1.279 which is found
almost exclusively in Canada (at least in my subset of GISAID
submissions with a collection date in 2020):</p>

<p>There's two samples from Nova Scotia that have collection dates in
November and December 2020, and that have a total of 19 mutations from
Wuhan-Hu-1. There's a couple of missing links between those samples and
their closest ancestor on GISAID, because the closest ancestor has only
14 mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1, but it is found in 103 samples which are
all from Alberta. And the closest ancestor of that strain in turn has 12
mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1, and it is found in 323 samples which are all
from Alberta or Saskachewan. (So there's again a missing link for a
sample with 13 mutations which is not found at GISAID, but the way how
you can trace the evolution of these strains one mutation at a time is
an indication of how stable the virus is contrary to what Couey claims.)
Next there's 4 different sets of mutations which are all ancestral to
the two samples from Nova Scotia but which have different mutations in
common with it, but all four strains are only found in Alberta. And
finally there is one set of 10 mutations which is found in 22 samples
but they are all from Alberta. The following code shows all samples
whose set of mutations is a subset of the samples from Nova Scotia and
that have at least 10 mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>
<p>In the output below, the first column shows the number of samples
with the same combination mutation set, country, and region. The second
column shows the number of mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1:</p>

<p>However in the southern states which had spikes in excess mortality
during the summer, there were also spikes in the PCR positivity rate
during the summer (and often the spikes in PCR positivity rate during
the summer preceded the spikes in excess deaths by about a week or two,
as is typical)

<p>Mexico also had one peak in excess mortality in July 2020 and another
in August 2021, but both coincided with a peak in PCR positivity rate.
And in Guatemala which is the first Central American country south after
Mexico, the two biggest spikes in excess mortality were in summer 2020
and summer 2021. Mexico also had big spikes in excess deaths around
January 2021 and January 2022, so it has a similar 4-hump pattern in
excess deaths as southern US states

<p>Around January 2022 when there was a spike in all-cause mortality in
Australia, Rancourt blamed it on the vaccines, even though the spike
coincided with a spike in PCR positivity rate. And all over the world
even in countries which did not roll out a new vaccine dose around
January-February 2022, there were similar spikes in excess deaths and
PCR positivity rate when Omicron appeared.</p>
<p>From the plot below which shows data for 8 different regions of
Australia, you can see that the peak in the number of new vaccines given
occurred around the same time in January 2022 in each region.</p>
<p>However unlike other regions of Australia, Western Australia had
close to 0% PCR positivity rate throughout January 2022, but Western
Australia also had low excess mortality in January 2022, and excess
deaths and PCR positivity rate only peaked a couple of months later.</p>
<p>In most states and territories of Australia, the PCR positivity rate
remained close to zero until January 2022 or late December 2021 when
Omicron appeared, and there was no clear increase in excess mortality
until Omicron either. However in Victoria where there was a small bump
in PCR positivity rate around August 2020, it coincided with a spike in
excess mortality. And later in October 2021, there was another small
increase in PCR positivity in Victoria which also coincided with a small
increase in excess mortality.</p>
<p>In New South Wales the daily number of new vaccines peaked in August
2021, but it coincided with a dip in excess mortality where the moving
average of excess mortality remained negative for about 2 months.</p>
<p>Around August 2022, most regions had a large dip in excess mortality
which coincided with a large dip in PCR positivity rate.</p>

<p>In all eight states and territories that were included in the

<p>In Ireland there was a spike in all-cause mortality around December

<a href=#Excess_mortality_in_Luxembourg id=Excess_mortality_in_Luxembourg>Excess

<p>USMortality says that there was no novel virus because there was no
clear increase in excess mortality in Luxembourg:

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-luxembourg-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However the data for Luxembourg has so much noise that it helps to
compare to it larger neighboring countries or to look at a moving
average of weekly data instead of raw weekly data. And if you compare a
15-day moving averages of excess mortality in Luxembourg, Netherlands,
and Belgium, you can see that there were at least five spikes in excess
mortality which occurred around the same time in all three Benelux
countries, which were around March 2020, August 2020, November 2020,
November 2021, and December 2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-luxembourg-3.webp width=600>

<p>USMortality also posted a plot which showed that Luxembourg appeared
had higher yearly excess mortality in 2003 than in 2020.

But it might partially be because according to the World Mortality
Database, Luxembourg had 368 deaths in August 2003 but only 290 deaths
in August 2004, and a report published by the EU said: <span
class="quote">"In total, more than 80,000 additional deaths were
recorded in 2003 in the twelve countries concerned by excess mortality
compared to the 1998-2002 period. Whereas 70,000 of these additional
deaths occurred during the summer, still over 7,000 occurred afterwards.
Nearly 45,000 additional deaths were recorded in August alone, as well
as more than 11,000 in June, more than 10,000 in July and nearly 5,000
in September. The mortality crisis of early August extended over the two
weeks between August 3rd and 16th. 15,000 additional deaths were
recorded in the first week and nearly 24,000 in the second. The excess
mortality in this second week reached the exceptional value of 96.5% in
France and over 40% in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Luxembourg."</span>

<p>However Sweden had negative excess ASMR in the last quarter of 2019

that many COVID deaths in 2020 if you use Q4 to Q3 years. And Sweden had
high excess mortality in the fourth quarter of 2020, so if you include
the last quarter of 2020 under 2021, then it makes it look like more
people died of vaccines in 2021 and less people died of COVID in 2020:

<p>However Taiwan was basically free of COVID until April or May 2022,
so they essentially only entered their second year of COVID in the
second quarter of 2023. The first big spike in excess deaths coincided
with the first big increase in PCR positivity rate but it came about a
year after the vaccines were rolled out:</p>

class="quote">"excess mortality spring 2018"</span> translated to
German, and I found an article which said in German that <span
class="quote">"The exceptionally strong flu wave of 2017/18 is estimated
to have cost the lives of around 25,100 people in Germany. This is the
highest number of deaths in the past 30 years, as the President of the
Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, explained today with a view
to his own current evaluations."</span>

<p>Then when I looked at WHO's influenza testing data for Germany in
2018, I found that the percentage of positive PCR tests and the number
of positive PCR tests both peaked on the week ending March 4th, which
was a week before the peak in weekly excess deaths in Germany (which
matches how the PCR positivity rate for COVID has often also peaked one
or two weeks before COVID deaths):

deaths in South Korea in 2022</a>
</h3>
<p>The standard modus operandi of USMortality is that he posts a plot
which only displays excess mortality and no other variables, and then he
blames the vaccines if there was higher excess mortality after the
vaccine rollout than before it (regardless of whether the spikes in
excess mortality coincided with spikes in COVID deaths or PCR
positivity, or if the excess deaths happened at a time when a small
number of new vaccines were given, or if the excess mortality didn't
increase until long after the vaccine rollout). He employed the same
trick in this tweet about how South Korea had low excess mortality until
2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-korea.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>However South Korea is another country like Australia where the first
big spike in COVID deaths happened long after the vaccines were rolled
out, and actually it coincided with a low point in the daily number of
new vaccines given, so it's difficult to blame it on the vaccines. But
like in the case of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia, the first big
spike in excess deaths in South Korea coincided with the first big
increase in PCR positivity rate:</p>

</h3>
<p>USMortality posted this plot which made it seem like Australia had a
steady increase in excess mortality which started in the first half of
2021 soon after the vaccines were rolled out to the general population:
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1716467659657953528>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1716467659657953528</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-australia.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However his plot used a 52-week moving average (where the window for
the moving average extended 51 weeks backwards, and not 26 weeks
backwards and 25 weeks forwards or vice versa). His plot gives the
impression that there was a stable increase in excess mortality starting
from mid-2021, but it could partially be because there was negative
excess mortality in 2020, so in 2021 as the window for the moving
average began to move past the period with negative excess mortality,
the value of the moving average began to increase.</p>
<p>From the plot below you can see that there was actually negative
excess mortality in mid-2021 when there was a peak in the number of new
vaccines given. And there wasn't a clear increase in excess mortality
until January 2022 when Australia got Omicron and when there was also
the first big increase in PCR positivity rate:</p>

<a href=#Plot_for_ARI_and_ILI_incidence_in_Germany id=Plot_for_ARI_and_ILI_incidence_in_Germany>Plot
for ARI and ILI incidence in Germany</a>
</h3>
<p>USMortality posted the plot below where he took data for the weekly
incidence of acute respiratory illness in Germany, then he predicted the
future incidence based on data from 2011 to early 2020, and then he
plotted the actual incidence in 2020-2023 overlaid with the 99.9%
prediction interval for his modeled incidence, and he claimed that there
was no statistically significant increase in the ARI incidence because
it mostly remained below the upper end of the 99.9% prediction interval
(except the incidence did actually reach above the prediction interval
in December 2022):
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1720237905577447549>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1720237905577447549</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-prediction-interval.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However I don't think statistical significance can be calculated from
the prediction interval, and USMortality didn't mention anything about
p-values in his Twitter thread.</p>
<p>USMortality normally uses a 95% prediction interval in his plots, but
in the plot above he may have chosen a 99.9% prediction interval if
there were too many observations that reached above the PI when he used
a 95% or 99% PI. So he might have just as well chosen a 99.999% PI and
then said that there was no statistically significant increase in the
ARI incidence if the incidence remained below the PI.</p>
<p>When I asked Bing AI if statistical significance can be calculated
from prediction intervals, it replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prediction intervals are a type of confidence interval used in
regression analysis to predict the value of a new observation based on
your existing model. They are a range of values that predicts the value
of a new observation, based on your existing model. Prediction intervals
are often confused with confidence intervals, but they are not quite the
same thing. Confidence intervals are a range of values associated with a
population parameter, while prediction intervals are where you expect a
future value to fall.</p>
<p>Statistical significance, on the other hand, is a measure of whether
an observed effect or relationship is real or just due to chance. It is
usually measured using a p-value, which is the probability of observing
a test statistic as extreme as the one computed from the sample data,
assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Therefore, prediction intervals and statistical significance are two
different concepts and cannot be measured using the same method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2022 when USMortality's plot shows that the line for ARI
incidence reached above the 99.9% prediction interval, Germany also had
the highest weekly excess mortality at OWID since the beginning of
2020:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-prediction-interval-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The plot above shows that there wasn't a very high number of COVID
deaths in December 2022 so maybe the spike in deaths wasn't caused by
COVID, but the ratio of influenza-like illness to acute respiratory
illness was higher than normally, so the spike in ARI cases may have
been caused by influenza viruses. In December 2022, Germany also had a
spike in the percentage of positive influenza tests, and almost all
positive specimens were the H3 subtype of influenza A:

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-prediction-interval-3.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>USMortality's tweet said that <span class="quote">"there was never a
stat. sign. increase in clinical illness"</span>, so I asked him how he
quantified if there was a statistically significant increase or not. He
answered <span class="quote">"increase above any previous high"</span>.
But after I pointed out that the peak in ARI incidence in December 2022
was higher than any previous peak since the data started in 2011, he
started to say again that the statistical significance was shown by the
prediction interval and not by whether there had been an increase above
any previous high. But the concept of statistical significance already
has an established definition, so he can't just make up his own
definitions of what statistical significance means, and he cannot keep
switching his definition depending on which definition suits his
needs.</p>
<p>I also asked this question from Google Gemini: <span
class="quote">"Can statistical significance be determined from whether
the observations reach above the 95% prediction interval or not?"</span>
It answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, determining statistical significance solely based on whether
observations fall within a 95% prediction interval is
<strong>not</strong> correct. Here's why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Different purposes:</strong> Statistical significance
tests the null hypothesis, which is the statement that there is no
effect, while a prediction interval estimates the range within which
future <strong>individual</strong> observations are likely to fall.
These serve different purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coverage probability:</strong> A 95% prediction interval
means there's a <strong>95% chance a single future observation</strong>
will fall within the interval, and a <strong>5% chance it
won't</strong>. Observing an observation outside the interval doesn't
necessarily mean statistical significance from randomness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One-sided vs. two-sided:</strong> Statistical
significance tests are typically two-sided, meaning they assess
deviations from the expected outcome in either direction (higher or
lower). Prediction intervals, however, are generally one-sided, focusing
on the range of possible future values.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, while observing an observation outside a 95% prediction
interval might be unexpected, it <strong>doesn't directly translate to
statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis</strong>.
Determining statistical significance requires appropriate statistical
tests, not just prediction intervals.</p>

<p>USMortality selected countries and jurisdictions with HDI above 0.8,
then he selected the 20 countries with the highest percentage of
vaccinated people at OWID, and he found that the median excess mortality
in the countries was 4.5% in 2020, 9.9% in 2021, and 11.2% in 2022,
which he said meant that <span class="quote">"median all-cause excess

He didn't explain how he derived the figure of 149%, but it might come
from the difference between the excess mortality in 2022 and 2020
(<code>(11.2-4.5)/4.5</code>). And I guess a 149% increase sounds more
impressive than an increase of 6.7 percentage points.</p>

<p>One problem with USMortality's analysis is that even in countries
like Italy and Spain that had a high number of COVID deaths in spring
2020, the average excess mortality for 2020 still includes January and
February 2020. And for example Costa Rica had almost no COVID deaths
until July 2020, so about half of Costa Rica's average excess mortality
in 2020 consists of the period before they got COVID.</p>
<p>USMortality's analysis also included several countries and
jurisdictions which were barely hit by COVID until 2022 or 2021, like
Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.
According to OWID, 11 out of 20 countries and jurisdictions in his
analysis didn't reach 100 COVID deaths per million until 2021 or
2022:</p>

<p>Hong Kong is missing from the code block above because OWID's data
for COVID deaths comes from WHO which includes Hong Kong under China.
But in JHU's dataset where Hong Kong is not included under China, Hong
Kong had only 213 COVID deaths at the beginning of February 2022 until
the number of deaths exploded to about 8,000 by the end of March 2022.
In Hong Kong the excess mortality, PCR positivity rate, and COVID deaths
all remained flat from 2020 until February 2022. According to OWID, Hong
Kong had about 170% excess mortality in March 2022 even though about 85%
of the population of Hong Kong was already vaccinated in March 2022.
However according to the table below, about 70% of COVID deaths in Hong
Kong in 2022 were in unvaccinated people (and I don't think the large
number of deaths in unvaccinated people can be explained by
misclassification of people as unvaccinated for 2 or 3 weeks after their
first vaccine, since not that many people received their first vaccine
dose in 2022):

<p>Another problem with USMortality's analysis is that he used ASMR data
for 9 countries and CMR data for 11 countries, and he used the average
mortality in 2017-2019 as the baseline instead of the linear trend.
However most developed countries have an increasing trend in CMR, so if
you use the average CMR in 2017-2019 as the baseline instead of the
linear trend in 2017-2019, then it's going to exaggerate the excess CMR
in 2021-2022 relative to 2020. But on the other hand most developed
countries have a decreasing trend in ASMR, so if you use the average
ASMR in 2017-2019 as the baseline instead of linear trend in 2017-2019,
then it's going to downplay the excess ASMR in 2021-2022 relative to
2020.</p>
<p>For example from the plots for New Zealand below, you can see that
the excess ASMR in 2021 is negative if you use the average ASMR in
2017-2019 as the baseline, but it's positive if you use a baseline based
on linear regression of data from 2017-2019 (even though in this case
the slope of the baseline looks a bit too steep, so it would probably be
better to extend the fitting period to 2015-2019):
[<a href=https://next.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=NZL&ct=yearly&df=2013&dt=2022&bf=2017&bt=2019&bm=linear_regression&pi=0&v=2>https://next.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=NZL&amp;ct=yearly&amp;df=2013&amp;dt=2022&amp;bf=2017&amp;bt=2019&amp;bm=linear_regression&amp;pi=0&amp;v=2</a>]</p>

<p>And also when I used a linear regression of data from 2017-2019 as
the baseline, Italy got 18.1% ASMR in 2020 and 21.3% in 2022, so there
was an increase of about 18%. But when I used the 2017-2019 average as
the baseline, Italy got 11.3% excess ASMR in 2020 and 7.5% in 2022, so
there was a decrease of about 34%.

<p>In the table most age groups have negative excess mortality on most
years before 2020. But it's because the plot used the average mortality
rate in the five previous years as the baseline, and Germany has a
decreasing trend in the CMR of most individual age groups even though
the CMR of the total population has an increasing trend:

<p>And also if you look at the quarterly excess ASMR percent for Germany
at Mortality Watch, it was about -7% in the first quarter of 2020, about
0% in the next two quarters, and about 12% in the fourth quarter. So the
period of high excess mortality had already started in late 2020 before
the vaccinations. But the total excess mortality in 2020 also includes
the months before COVID, when there was negative excess mortality in
many Western European countries including Germany.</p>
<p>Germany also had low excess mortality in summer 2020 when PCR
positivity rate was also low. But there was a spike in excess mortality
in late 2020 which coincided with a spike in PCR positivity:</p>

<p>However he should've read the thread he quoted beyond the abstract,
because it didn't say that wastewater surveillance cannot be used to
measure the amount of viral RNA present in a sample, but that wastewater
samples cannot be used to do whole-genome assembly of individual strains
because reads from different people are mixed together:
[<a href=https://virological.org/t/wastewater-samples-cannot-be-used-for-genome-assembly/921>https://virological.org/t/wastewater-samples-cannot-be-used-for-genome-assembly/921</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the recent paper by Fielding-Miller et al. (1), the authors
seem to confuse:</p>
<p>1.) the general concept of SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) genome assembly with</p>
<p>2.) what is possible with wastewater amplicon sequencing and</p>
<p>3.) SC2 whole genome sequencing (WGS) from clinical isolate/sample
amplicon sequencing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I have seen researchers confuse these
points, so it bears drawing explicit lines to define the scope of
wastewater sequencing surveillance analyses with how it is implemented.
Number 3 can be used to assemble full-length SC2 genome assemblies.
Number 2 can at best be used to estimate the proportion of sequence
heterogeneity in pooled environmental specimens. Assemblies would
require confirmation of 2 with 3.</p>
<p>One CANNOT assemble genomes from a typical wastewater sample except
under highly controlled conditions. A major reason is because genetic
material from multiple strains and persons are mixed or pooled together.
Reads generated are also much shorter than the lengths of SC2 genomes.
This leads to loss of physical linkage (phasing) information in diluted
samples and/or samples with low percent reference coverage. This is
solved by using isolates with higher sequencing depth (often with lower
ct), percent reference coverage, and samples from individuals, not
pools. Samples can degrade prior to collection and/or during transit,
leading to noise or shorter fragments, preventing long-read sequencing
from being a de facto solution to phasing. Wastewater samples in absence
of viral isolation, subculturing, and isolate sequencing with measurable
SC2 signal (ct lower than 30) would at best look like a box of mixed
puzzle pieces, but pieces from different puzzles.</p>

<p>Fabian Spieker shared a nearly complete set of GISAID sequences with
a collection date in 2020. I ran NextClade CLI on the sequences which
aligned each sequence against Wuhan-Hu-1, and I counted which were the
most common starting and ending positions of the sequences in Wuhan-Hu-1
coordinates:</p>

5636    40   29903
5472    55   29903</pre>
<p>So the output above shows that by far the most common combination was
55 to 29,836. When I googled for the numbers, I found a paper which
said:
[<a href=https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07283-6>https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07283-6</a>]</p>

<p>Amplicon libraries (ARTIC v3, Tailed v1, Tailed v2) were diluted to 8
pM in Illumina's HT1 buffer, spiked with 5% PhiX, and sequenced using a
MiSeq 600 cycle v3 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Amplicon read depths were determined by counting the number of
aligned reads covering the base at the center of each amplicon region.
The iVar software package was used to trim primer sequences from the
aligned reads, and iVar and Samtools mpileup were used to call variants
and generate consensus sequences [3]. Variants located outside of the
region targeted by the amplicon panel were filtered out (reference
genome positions 1-54 and 29,836-29,903), and consensus sequences bases
corresponding to those regions were trimmed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all three versions of the ARCTIC protocol, the first forward
primer matches positions 30 to 54 and the last reverse primer matches
positions 29,836 to 29,866:

<p>However in the newer MIDNIGHT protocol which was launched by Oxford
Nanopore Technologies in September 2021, the first forward primer
matches positions 30 to 54 and the last reverse primer matches positions
29,790 to 29,814.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363454268_SARS-CoV2_genome_sequencing_protocol_1200bp_amplicon_midnight_primer_set_using_Nanopore_Rapid_kit_v5>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363454268_SARS-CoV2_genome_sequencing_protocol_1200bp_amplicon_midnight_primer_set_using_Nanopore_Rapid_kit_v5</a>]
So the range between the primers is 46 bases shorter than in the ARCTIC
protocol (<code>(29835-55+1)-(29789-55+1)</code>). And therefore the
gradual switch from ARCTIC to MIDNIGHT might partially explain the
decrease in average sequence length at GISAID which started in late
2021.</p>
<p>Fabian Spieker scraped GISAID for FASTA files of about 4 million
submissions from the United States:

I tried aligning the sequences in the FASTA files against
Wuhan-Hu-1:</p>

<p>In 2020 by far the most common aligned range was bases 55 to 29,836,
which matches the primers in the first three versions of the ARCTIC
protocol:</p>

<p>In many European countries like Belgium, Bulgary, Chechia, Italy, and

it's difficult to blame it on the vaccines:</p>

<p>USMortality posted this tweet which appeared to indicate that ages

<p>However if you read the small print, it says that the baseline was
the 2017-2019 average. But developed countries usually have a decreasing
rate in mortality rate within age groups, which means that the average
baseline underestimates excess mortality if you look at CMR within age
groups. When I used the 5-year linear regression baseline that is used
by Mortality Watch by default, I got about 3% excess CMR for ages 65-74
in 2020:</p>

<p>Germany also had negative excess mortality in the first quarter of

quarter of 2020 before vaccines were rolled out, because the first

<p>However his July 2019 to June 2020 year only includes one quarter
during COVID, and the 3 quarters before it all had negative

<p>OWID uses a 2015-2019 linear regression baseline for all countries,
but it's inaccurate in the case of Sweden because 2019 had such low
mortality. However the ETS baseline that USMortality used in the plot
above doesn't give too much weight to 2019, so it actually produces
negative total excess ASMR in the vaccine era in 2021-2023:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-ets-3.webp width=600>

<p>Mortality Watch calculates ASMR for some countries like Sweden so
that it uses the five broad age groups at STMF (0-14, 15-64, 65-74,
75-84, and 85+). I thought it may have explained why Sweden got negative
total excess ASMR in 2021-2023, but here I got positive excess ASMR in
2021-2023 even when I used the STMF age groups, so it's probably because
I used a polynomial baseline instead of an ETS baseline (but the ETS
baseline might actually be more accurate):</p>

<p>However that plot shows the raw number of deaths with a 2015-2019
average baseline, which may be inaccurate because Sweden had an
unusually low number of deaths in 2019, and with ASMR you can even get
negative total excess mortality in 2021-2023 depending on the
baseline.</p>
<p>Sweden had a decreasing trend in deaths per year in the 00s and a
roughly flat trend in the 2010s, but I believe the trend would've
started to increase in the 2020s even without COVID, because according
to population estimates from statistikdatabasen.scb.se, the total
population in ages 80 and above was about 17% higher in 2023 than
2018:</p>
<pre>&gt; t=read.csv(&quot;http://sars2.net/f/swedenpopdead.csv&quot;)
&gt; tail(with(subset(t,age&gt;=80),tapply(pop,year,sum)))
  2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023
522133 536306 543720 559634 582347 611556</pre>
<p>In the plot below I calculated a second-degree polynomial trend for
CMR by single year of age in 2000-2018, then I derived the expected
deaths for each year by multiplying the population size of each age
group by the trend in CMR. The expected number of deaths per year
already started to increase after 2012, but the increase got even
steeper in 2018-2023. The total excess mortality in 2020-2023 was about
-0.3%, so I guess it's possible that Sweden has actually had negative
excess mortality since the start of 2020:</p>

<p>However in Montana the counties with a higher percentage of
vaccinated people had more COVID deaths in 2020, so it's similar to the
US as a whole. More remote regions weren't hit as hard by COVID in 2020
but they also had a lower percentage of vaccinated people:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-montana-2.webp width=600>

<p>Larger counties also tend to have a higher percentage of vaccinated
people than smaller counties, so from the bottom plot above you can see
that my regression line got steeper when I weighted the linear
regression for 2021-2023 by the population size.</p>
<p>The R code to generate the plot above is similar to the code here:
<a href=ethical.html#COVID_deaths_per_capita_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_population_in_US_counties>ethical.html#COVID_deaths_per_capita_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_population_in_US_counties</a>.</p>
<p>USMortality also posted the image below and wrote: <span

<p>However some of his dark green counties have a population below 5,000
or even below 2,000, so they have a lot of random noise. In the map
below there's 12 counties with population below 2,000, but all of them
had at least one MCoD COVID death according to the dataset I used (which
shows daily cumulative COVID deaths by county similar to the NY Times
dataset, but it's published in a more convenient format where you don't
have to combine multiple different CSV files):

<p>USMortality said that he used data from CDC WONDER, but I don't
understand how he calculated ASMR for small counties, because they have
many age groups with less than 10 deaths per year, and CDC WONDER
suppresses the number of deaths on rows with less than 10 deaths. CDC
WONDER also has an option to include a column for precalculated ASMR
values, but it's not available when the results are grouped by
county:</p>
<div>

<p>USMortality also published an appendix at Google Docs which featured
additional plots of the data from Montana.

However some of his plots have over 5,000 yearly deaths per 1,000
people, so he probably made some error (because even 5,000 deaths per
100,000 people would be too high):</p>

<p>In this plot USMortality showed that Germany had high ASMR in 2003
which he attributed it to the crash of the dot com bubble:

<p>However if you look at monthly seasonality-adjusted excess ASMR,
there's one spike in March 2003 and another spike in August 2003:
[<a href=https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=DEU&ct=monthly&e=1&cs=bar&df=2000%2520Jan&dt=2005%2520Dec&bf=2000%2520Jan&bt=2009%2520Dec&bm=lin_reg>https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=DEU&amp;ct=monthly&amp;e=1&amp;cs=bar&amp;df=2000%2520Jan&amp;dt=2005%2520Dec&amp;bf=2000%2520Jan&amp;bt=2009%2520Dec&amp;bm=lin_reg</a>]</p>

<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-germany2003-1.webp width=600>

<p>I suspect the spike in March 2003 may have been caused by influenza
viruses. One website said this in German: <span class="quote">"But
devastating waves of flu are by no means a thing of the past. During the
last major flu epidemic in 1995/96, with around 8.5 million cases,
around 30,000 people died from the effects of influenza in Germany
alone. In the 2002/2003 flu season, compared to an average winter, there
were around 4.5 to 5 million additional visits to the doctor, around 1.5
to 2 million people in the 16 to 60 age group unable to work, and 25,000
to 30,000 more hospital admissions across all age groups."</span>
[<a href=https://www.lungenaerzte-im-netz.de/krankheiten/grippe/historisches/>https://www.lungenaerzte-im-netz.de/krankheiten/grippe/historisches/</a>]</p>
<p>In the Robert Koch Institute's report about the influenza season
2002-2003, the PCR positivity rate for influenza viruses peaked on week
9 of 2003:

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-usmortality-germany2003-2.webp width=600>

<p>The spike in August 2003 may have been caused by a heatwave, because
the summer of 2003 was the warmest recorded summer in Europe since at
least the 1500s.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heatwave>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heatwave</a>]
In this plot for estimated heat-related deaths in Germany, 2003 has a
higher number of deaths than any other year except 1994:

<p>I also don't know how much effect the dot com bubble would've still
had in 2003. Between 2001 and 2002 there was a smaller increase in
German GDP per capita than during surrounding years, but between 2002
and 2003 the increase in GDP roughly followed the trend.

<p>I guess he determined whether there was significant excess mortality
from whether the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval was above
zero or not. I'm not sure if it's a valid method to determine
statistical significance. But anyway, his plot used a 2017 to 2019
average baseline, but it's too high especially in 2023 and 2022 because
Sweden had a decreasing trend in ASMR before COVID:</p>

the number of months when the 95% PI was above zero now increased from 3
to 8, because they now also included November 2020, January 2021,
December 2022, November 2023, and December 2023:

But Sweden also had fairly high COVID deaths in late 2023, and according
to OWID Sweden had 1,874 COVID deaths in the fourth quarter of 2023,
which was about 36% of the number of deaths in the second quarter of
2020 (even though COVID deaths seem to have been underdiagnosed in the
second quarter of 2020 based on the ratio of excess all-cause deaths to
COVID deaths):</p>

textbook about virology: <span class="quote">"Remarkably, HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-HKU1 were only discovered recently, in the post-SARS era, despite
the fact that each has a worldwide prevalence and has been in
circulation for a long time."</span>
[<a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2054590093?t=1h8m9s>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2054590093?t=1h8m9s</a>]
So then Couey said that maybe SARS-CoV-2 was similarly circulating in
humans for a long time but it just wasn't deteceted earlier: <span
class="quote">"So how would we differentiate between the novel spreading
pathogen and a pathogen that already had previous endemicity - that was
already in the background - that we didn't even notice, that we didn't
even detect until recently. And how would we know how many of these
viruses have been detected in the background as part of a complement of
RNA signals that are just there all the time, and we still haven't been
able to get a good solid read on, because people like Nathan Wolfe have
told us it's just like a dark matter of life down there, dark matter of
DNA and RNA, genetic noise inside of which are hidden new life forms.
How do we know that they haven't hypercharacterized that whole
background signal at that size scale? [...] Well how could something have
a worldwide prevalence and us not know it? How many more things could
have a worldwide prevalence but we wouldn't have known because we just
didn't pay attention, because we have common colds all the
time."</span></p>
<p>In a later part of the stream Couey may have referred indirectly to a
section of my <code>nopandemic.html</code> file where I pointed out that
there's about 15 million sequencing runs that were published before 2020
at the NCBI's Sequence Read Archive, but I didn't find reads of
SARS-CoV-2 in any of them, and the only runs I found where sarbecovirus
reads may have come from a human sample were French influenza A samples
from 2008-2013 which matched SARS1 (but the runs matched lab-created
wtic and ExoN1 strains of SARS1 so they may have also been contaminated
in the lab).</p>
<p>So I decided to try if I could find reads of HKU1 or NL63 in random
metagenomic sequencing runs at the SRA. So I ran this query to search
for runs published before 2020 which had 10 or more reads that had a
STAT hit for NL63:
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-bigquery/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-bigquery/</a>]</p>
<pre>select * from `nih-sra-datastore.sra.metadata` as m, `nih-sra-datastore.sra_tax_analysis_tool.tax_analysis` as tax where m.acc=tax.acc and tax_id=277944 and total_count&gt;=10 and releasedate&lt;&quot;2020-01-01&quot; order by releasedate</pre>
<p>There were a total of 101 results, which included some runs where the
purpose was to sequence NL63, but they also included some random human
metagenomic samples:</p>
<pre class=fullwidth>$ wget sars2.net/f/bigquerynl63.json
$ jq -r &#39;.[]|[.acc,.sra_study,.total_count,.mbytes,.avgspotlen,.organism,(.releasedate|sub(&quot; .*&quot;;&quot;&quot;)),.assay_type,.center_name]|join(&quot;|&quot;)&#39; bigquerynl63.json

<p>When I tried picking some metagenomic runs at random from the list
above, at first I looked up this entry:
<code>SRR6994612|SRP139809|50|0|338|metagenome|2018-04-12|OTHER|CDC-PDD</code>.
It was part of a study titled <span class="quote">"Respiratory Virus
Enrichment Method for Genomic Sequencing and Identification"</span>, but
the authors of the study did targeted enrichment specifically for NL63,
so I rejected it because the authors knew that they were looking for
NL63.

<code>SRR7754038|SRP083744|203|11|115|viral metagenome|2018-08-24|WGS|WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE</code>.
The abstract for the run at SRA said: <span class="quote">"Metagenomic

stool, nasopharynx, skin, etc."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR7754038>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR7754038</a>]
The sample was described as a nasopharyngeal swab. I downloaded the
reads and I aligned them against a FASTA file of about 19,000 virus
reference sequences:</p>

out that you also had herpes):</p>

<p>In the code above I used loose alignment criteria which were loose
enough that they would cause some reads of SARS-CoV-2 to get aligned
against SARS1, so if you would've ran the code in 2019 when SARS-CoV-2
wasn't included in NCBI's set of virus reference sequences but SARS1
was, then you would've been able to discover that the reads contained
some novel SARS-like virus if you got reads of SARS-CoV-2 to align
against SARS1. Winjor Small Mountain Dog used a similar method to
discover SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, because his lab did metagenomic
sequencing for a sample of an early COVID patient and he found that some
of the reads matched SARS1.</p>
<p>In the following code where I took the same metagenomic reads which
matched NL63 and I tried to align them against hCoV 229E, I got 2 reads
which aligned against 229E with an average mismatch rate of about 21%.
So if I would've run the code at a time when the genome of 229E had been
published but the genome of NL63 hadn't been, then I would've been able
to discover that the reads matched some new virus that was related to
229E:</p>

<p>Next I tried downloading another metagenomic run that was part of a
study where the abstract said: <span class="quote">"Overall design: 208
children with exacerbation prone asthma were enrolled according to the

prospectively monitored for the onset of cold symptoms (Events) during a

This run had almost a thousand times more reads than the run I looked at
previously, so I also got a much larger number of reads which aligned
against NL63. I also got 100% coverage for an <em>Escherichia</em>
phage. Even though I filtered out human reads, some human still remained
which aligned against viruses like Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus,
but you can tell that the sarcoma viruses are likely spurious matches
since they have a high error rate:</p>

<p>So similarly if SARS-CoV-2 would've been widespread in humans before
2020, you would be able to find reads of SARS-CoV-2 in random
metagenomic sequencing runs of human samples. Even if the runs would've
been removed from SRA, sequencing labs keep their own copies of their
past sequencing runs, and there's also several organizations which have
been mirroring the SRA (including the publicly available mirrors by the
European ENA and the Chinese GSA).</p>

<p>But I don't understand why it would not be possible to arrange the
sequences to a phylogenic tree. If you simply have a list of SNVs that
each sample has relative to Wuhan-Hu-1, then you can calculate the
distance between a pair of samples by counting how many mutations exist
only in one of the two samples but not in both. And you can make a
distance matrix by repeating the same procedure for each pair of
samples. And then you can turn the distance matrix into a phylogenic
tree.</p>
<p>This code downloads the mutation list of about 700,000 GISAID
submissions from 2020 and it makes a phylogenetic tree for a random
subset of 50 sequences:</p>

there over 16 million sequences you can download from GISAID? Most
patients have only one sequence at GISAID, and even the patients with

<p>Mark Kulacz from Housatonic Live said: <span class="quote">"If we had
a 100, 150 thousand - it all depends on what you consider to be the
baseline - excess deaths of drug overdoses between 2020, 2021, and 2022
- if we had that many excess deaths from drug overdoses, how is it
possible that for those three years, the total number of excess deaths
equals the total number of COVID deaths? I didn't say 150,000 people
died of drug overdose. What I said was excess deaths. During those three
years, we actually had 315,000 drug overdose deaths, in the United
States in those three years. Baseline as of the year 2000 was 32,000
people a year. So you could make it a point that it's over 200,000.
Well, 200,000, you could make it a point it's 100,000, 110,000 excess
deaths of the 307,000 based upon the record level going into 2019. How
is it possible that you can have at least over 100,000 - maybe 150,000 -
excess deaths of another tragedy? Yet the total excess deaths equals the
total number of COVID deaths. How is that possible? Do we have 150,000
less people die from shark attacks? Did we have 150,000 less people die
from car accidents?"</span>

<p>Housatonic said that there were only about 100-150 thousand COVID
deaths in the United States in 2020-2022, but actually the number
reported by CDC and OWID is about 1.1 million:</p>

2021 467051
2022 265838
2023 44696</pre>
<p>The number of excess deaths during the COVID pandemic is typically
not calculated relative to the number of deaths during a single year
like 2019, but it's calculated relative to a past trend, like the trend
from 2015 to 2019 in the case of CDC's dataset for excess mortality
during COVID.
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>]
So if there was an increasing trend in drug overdose deaths in
2015-2019, then the trend is included in the baseline that is used to
calculate excess mortality.</p>
<p>In the plot below which shows the yearly number of drug overdose
deaths and some other drug-related deaths in the US, the total number of
deaths was about 92,000 in 2020 and about 107,000 in 2021:

<p>You can get similar data yourself from CDC WONDER.
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html</a>]
First click on <span class="quote">"Data Request"</span> under the final
data for 1999-2020 and click <span class="quote">"I Agree"</span>. Then
in section 1, set <span class="quote">"Group Results By"</span> to <span

each ICD code on its own line), and in section 8 click <span
class="quote">"Export Results"</span>, and then click <span
class="quote">"Send"</span>. Then repeat the same procedure for the
provisional data from 2018 until the present.</p>
<p>Then run this code:</p>

<p>Then run the following R code which calculates yearly excess deaths

     2017  70237 64854.0  5383.0
     2018  67367 68872.7 -1505.7

     2020  91799 76910.1 14888.9
     2021 106699 80928.8 25770.2
     2022 108193 84947.5 23245.5
&gt; sum(t$excess[t$Year&gt;=2020])
[1] 63904.6</pre>
<p>So the code above shows that the total number of excess deaths in
2020-2022 was only about 64,000 (even though some deaths from 2022 are
still missing because drug-related deaths often have a long registration
delay).</p>
<p>Here's also a plot of the same data:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/housatonic-drug.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>It's also difficult to confuse drug deaths with COVID deaths because
most COVID deaths are in elderly age groups but most deaths from drug
overdoses are in younger age groups. And COVID deaths occur in waves
which coincide with waves of high PCR positivity rate, but drug deaths
are distributed more evenly throughout the year. And COVID deaths also
occur at different times in different states, so that for example
southern states had waves of COVID deaths in summer 2020 and summer 2021
which didn't occur in northern states, but there is less within-year
variation in the pattern of drug overdose deaths across states.</p>
<p>In another YouTube stream, Housatonic said: <span
class="quote">"Through statistical manipulation, flu deaths are
reclassified as COVID deaths. Which in and of itself does not increase
the overall mortality. But you know what did? Those drug overdose deaths
in vast quantity backfilled missing flu deaths."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vuLqXHK0P0&t=20m35s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vuLqXHK0P0&amp;t=20m35s</a>]
However in the years before COVID, CDC estimated that the average number
of influenza deaths per year in the US was only about 30,000, but the
total number of excess deaths in the United States from 2020 to 2022 is
listed as about 1.25 million at OWID.
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html</a>,

class="uri">https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-excess-deaths-covid?country=%7eUSA&amp;time=earliest</a>..2023-01-01</a>]
Flu deaths generally occur in the winter and they coincide with periods
when there's a high PCR positivity rate for influenza viruses, but
according to WHO's influenza statistics for the United States, the PCR
positivity rate for influenza viruses was close to 0% from spring 2020
until around November 2021.
[<a href=https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTkyODcyOTEtZjA5YS00ZmI0LWFkZGUtODIxNGI5OTE3YjM0IiwidCI6ImY2MTBjMGI3LWJkMjQtNGIzOS04MTBiLTNkYzI4MGFmYjU5MCIsImMiOjh9>https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTkyODcyOTEtZjA5YS00ZmI0LWFkZGUtODIxNGI5OTE3YjM0IiwidCI6ImY2MTBjMGI3LWJkMjQtNGIzOS04MTBiLTNkYzI4MGFmYjU5MCIsImMiOjh9</a>]
The excess deaths caused by COVID occurred at different times in
different US states but they generally coincided with periods when there
was high PCR positivity rate for COVID, so for example in southern
states where there were spikes in COVID deaths in the summer, there were
also spikes in PCR positivity rate during the summer.
[<a href=#Excess_deaths_in_southern_US_states_in_summer_2020>#Excess_deaths_in_southern_US_states_in_summer_2020</a>]</p>
<p>Drug deaths have a fairly uniform distribution throughout the year
with few sudden spikes in deaths (except for some reason most states
seem to have had an increase in drug deaths in May 2020):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-housatonic-drug.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>Housatonic also said that the number of COVID deaths in the United
States was approximately equal to the number of excess deaths, so he was
wondering what happened to the excess drug-related deaths. However
according to OWID's data for the United States, there's about 1.08
million COVID deaths in 2020-2022 but about 1.25 million excess deaths.
[<a href=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-excess-deaths-covid?time=earliest%2e%2e2023-01-01&country=%7eUSA>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-excess-deaths-covid?time=earliest%2e%2e2023-01-01&amp;country=%7eUSA</a>]
And in a dataset for excess deaths published by the CDC, on weeks ending
in 2020-2022, there's about 1.32 million excess deaths based on the
reported data, and there's about 1.61 million excess deaths based on the
weighted data, which uses Farrington surveillance algorithms to account
for deaths that are missing because of a registration delay:

about using Remdesivir to treat emerging betacoronaviruses</a>
</h3>
<p>Housatonic did a video about a paper published in March 2019 where
one author was Baric's postdoc student and the other author was Sina
Bavari.
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7103675/>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7103675/</a>]
He said: <span class="quote">"We should see that Ralph Baric's last
postdoc student actually co-authored a document called
<em>Broad-spectrum coronavirus antiviral drug discovery</em>, which was
published in early 2019, which actually says very specifically that
GS-5734 from Gilead - Remdesivir - is the most likely thing to work
against a novel coronavirus that causes a global pandemic spilling out
of Asia, probably China via a wet market after jumping off of a bat or
camel. This document is the smoking gun of the entire pandemic."</span>

<p>The authors of the paper may have well had foreknowledge of the COVID
pandemic. However the paper doesn't say anything about a pandemic
emerging in Asia or likely China. The only part of the paper which
mentions China is a sentence which says that <span
class="quote">"SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of
southeastern China in late 2002"</span>. And the paper doesn't even
mention wet markets apart from saying that <span class="quote">"SARS-CoV
was detected in small animals like civets and raccoon dogs that were
present in live-animal markets"</span>. And the paper doesn't say that
there would be a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus that came from
a bat or camel, but it just described the official story about the
origins of SARS1 and MERS.</p>
<p>The paper did say that bat sarbecoviruses and merbecoviruses are
called <span class="quote">"pre-emergent"</span> because they have the
potential to emerge into human populations: <span class="quote">"Recent
studies suggest that BatCoV-SHC014 and BatCoV-WIV1 are genetically
similar to SARS-CoV and enter cells using human receptors [10,15,16].
Similarly, BatCoV-HKU4 and BatCoV-HKU5 are MERS-like BatCoVs that may
also be circulating in bat populations, and some MERS-like BatCoVs may
also be able to recognize human host cell receptors [17-19]. Such
BatCoVs are now called <span class="quote">'pre-emergent'</span>,
because they may have the potential to emerge into human
populations."</span></p>
<p>The paper was about an antiviral drug for treating emerging
betacoronaviruses in humans, so it made sense for the authors to
describe previous human epidemics that were caused by betacoronaviruses.
And just because the official story about the origins of SARS-CoV-2
shared some features in common with the official story about the origins
of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and because the authors of the paper described
the official story about the origins of SARS-CoV and MERS, it doesn't
mean that the authors were able to predict COVID.</p>
<p>People often also say that the virus in the Event 201 scenario came
from China or that it originated on a wet market, even though actually
it originated on pig farms in Brazil. Or people say that the virus in
the Lock Step scenario was a coronavirus or that it originated in China,
even though actually it was an influenza virus and its country of origin
was not specified.</p>

<p>Housatonic said: <span class="quote">"If you look at world population
charts - which are compiled from many data sources - if you look at it
between the year 1918 and 1919, you just will not see any world
population decrease. Matter of fact, it goes up. It goes up at the same
rate it did the year before and the year after, more or less. And unless
there was an unexplained one-time 25 to 50 million baby boom worldwide,
in addition to expected birth rates, that would not be the case if the
1918 Spanish narrative really was 25, 50, 100 million dead people. So
it's several hundred thousand, maybe a couple million worldwide. And it
was, to the best of what I can see, a bacterial infections, which were
spread because of the nature of World War I."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2epaylZzwQ&t=4m20s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2epaylZzwQ&amp;t=4m20s</a>]</p>
<p>I agree that the number of deaths caused by the Spanish flu might
well be in the millions and not tens of millions (unless you include
deaths that were caused by descendants of the Spanish flu strain of
H1N1, because they remained in circulation up to the 1950s).</p>
<p>But anyway, spikes in deaths caused by the Spanish Flu are not
necessarily visible in the world population estimates, because many
countries only have projected data available, or the population data is
interpolated from censuses which are performed every 1 to 3 decades so
that single-year spikes in deaths between censuses get smoothed out.</p>
<p>A website called GapMinder has published a dataset of historical
population estimates of countries by their present-day borders:
<a href=https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/.><a
href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/"
class="uri">https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/</a>.</a>
In the plot below where I included some European countries in their
dataset, but even Russia just has a smooth interpolated curve before the
1950s that doesn't have any clear dent in population size caused by the
Second World War or the Russian Civil War. But even the Russian Civil
War is estimated to have resulted in about 7-12 million deaths, so the
interpolated population estimates might similarly be hiding a large
number of deaths caused by the Spanish flu:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-housatonic-worldpop.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The first and only census of the Russian Empire was performed in
1897, but after that the first Soviet census was only performed 29 years
later in 1926 (even though it could be that neither census was even
incorporated in the data from GapMinder I used).</p>
<p>GapMinder's population estimates are based on modern-day national
boundaries, but it might be difficult to match old census data to
modern-day national boundaries, because for example at the time of the
Russian Empire, about 10% of the population of the Grand Duchy of
Finland lived within the borders of modern-day Russia, and the 1897
census might not include population estimates within different regions
of the Grand Duchy of Finland (or the regional population data might not
be included in summaries of the census data that are easily available to
people who compile world population estimates).</p>
<p>However instead of looking at historical population estimates which
are often interpolated from census data, a better way to estimate the
number of deaths caused by the Spanish flu might be to look at the
number of deaths, which is commonly more precise than population data.
For example Sweden is one of the countries that has data for deaths in
the 1910s available and that didn't take part in WW1. But Sweden still
had a massive spike in deaths in 1918:

it's not due to drug overdoses and suicides and all of these other ways

Then he said that Jessica Rose belongs in jail because she's trying to
cover up for deaths caused by opioid overdoses.
[<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1819711992958984448>https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1819711992958984448</a>]</p>
<p>However Jessica Rose was talking about a temporary increase in deaths
around August to September 2021, which didn't even occur in all states
but which was the most pronounced in southeastern states.</p>
<p>In the plot below which shows deaths by underlying cause of death in
ages 25 to 44, you can see that the drug deaths are fairly stable over
time, and there wasn't any sudden increase in drug deaths in August to
September 2021. But in the southern census region during the Delta wave
in August to September 2021, the number of COVID deaths was higher than
the number of drug deaths:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-housatonic-rosejail.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>So was there a sudden temporary increase in opioid overdoses in the
southern census region but not the northeastern census region? And were
the extra opioid deaths classified as COVID deaths?</p>
<p>There's also another problem with Housatonic's theory that the spike
in deaths in August to September 2021 was caused by opioids, which is
that the spike also occurred in elderly age groups even though elderly
age groups have only a small percentage of opioid deaths out of all
deaths:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-housatonic-rosejail-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Added later: Vilma Betancourt told me that traffic and firearm deaths
were falsely classified as COVID deaths.
[<a href=https://gigaohm.bio/@vilmabetancourt/posts/AwO4o9oCnyOu70HzA8>https://<a
href="mailto:gigaohm.bio/@vilmabetancourt"
class="email">gigaohm.bio/@vilmabetancourt</a>/posts/AwO4o9oCnyOu70HzA8</a>]
But I showed her the plot below, which shows that during the spike in
deaths in August to September 2021, ages below 45 didn't have any
massive depression in deaths from non-drug external causes, so the spike
in COVID deaths is hard to blame on deaths from external causes being
misclassified as COVID deaths:</p>

<p>In the United States in the current millennium, there have been two
times when deaths in ages 25-44 have increased by over 20% over a period
of two months. The first time in February to April 2020 was because of a
combination of drug deaths, deaths from external causes, and COVID. But
the second time between July and September 2021 was because of
COVID.</p>
<p>The total extra deaths during the spike in August to September 2021
weren't even very high compared to the overall excess deaths in
2020-2023, because there was a sustained increase in deaths that started
in 2020 and that was largely driven by drug deaths, and by deaths
indirectly caused by drugs. So does Housatonic care so much about the
two-month spike in particular that he is willing to imprison people who
say it's not caused by drugs?</p>

In December 2022 he was one of the first big names in the COVID

viruses flop as bioweapons and there were just localized releases of
cDNA clones, because he published a Substack post where he wrote: <span
class="quote">"There was never a pandemic of any lethal virus. The
sequences made by Baric, Daszak, Shi and their buddies in virology labs
around the world are viral sequences of RNA, but they are synthetic.
They can be effectively distributed via clones (lab based production of
RNA sequences) rather than letting an unstable real-life RNA coronavirus
loose on the world, which would likely regress and flop as a bioweapon.
What they proposed (a scary novel lethal coronavirus causing a pandemic)
is nigh on impossible, but the scare was real."</span>

ArcGIS which showed each individual update to the live data.

province-level data for China or because they published Chinese data
earlier than other sources. A paper by the developers of the JHU

China and at the country level otherwise."</span>
[<a href=https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/7159018>https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/7159018</a>]
The reason why they wrote that DXY was their primary source may have
been because the paper was published on February 19th 2020, when China
accounted for 74,278 out of 74,770 cumulative COVID cases worldwide
according to OWID. On a list of sources in a README file at JHU's GitHub
repository, DXY is now listed on third place after the WHO and the
European CDC, even though the sources are probably not listed in the
order of importance since a note next to the list says that ECDC was
<span class="quote">"not currently relied upon as a source of
data"</span>.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/</a>]</p>
<p>In the Twitter thread about the JHU dashboard, Jockthedog2 asked:
<span class="quote">"How would anyone at DXY have up-to-date numbers
for, say, Portugal? Or Belize? Or Argentina? Numbers that are supposedly
more accurate than the official figures from those countries'
governments?"</span> However in a README file at JHU's GitHub
repository, there's a list of over a hundred different data sources in
addition to DXY, and the source for data from Portugal was listed as the
Portuguese <span class="quote">"General Directorate of Health"</span>
until 2022 but WHO afterwards.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/</a>]</p>
<p>In the Twitter thread by Jockthedog2, he also linked to a GitHub
issue where the someone pointed out that in a CSV file for the daily
cumulative number of cases published by the JHU, the number of cases for
New South Wales didn't match the figures listed at health.nsw.gov.au,
because for example on March 7th there were 28 instead of 36 cases
listed.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/426>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/426</a>]
However it might be because in a CSV file at JHU's GitHub, the date when
the data for NSW was updated is listed as 2020-03-07T02:03:30, but New
South Wales follows the time zone UTC+10/11, so JHU's CSV file may have
been missing half a day's worth of cases.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-07-2020.csv>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-07-2020.csv</a>]
In an epidemiology report published by the Australian government,
there's 33 cumulative cases listed up to March 7th but they only include
cases up to 19:00 AEDT (8:00 UTC).
[<a href=https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/novel_coronavirus_2019_ncov_weekly_epidemiology_reports_australia_2020.htm>https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/novel_coronavirus_2019_ncov_weekly_epidemiology_reports_australia_2020.htm</a>]
So the reason for some of these discrepancies in the daily case numbers
might be that local authorities sometimes publish their reports at the
end of the working day and not at the end of the day, or that JHU's CSV
files at GitHub are in UTC but data reported by local authorities is
usually in a local time zone. In the GitHub issue about the discrepancy
in the case numbers for NSW, the case number from health.nsw.​gov.​au for
each day is always somewhere inclusively between the numbers listed by
the JHU for the current day and the next day.</p>
<p>Jockthedog2 linked to an issue at GitHub which pointed out that the
cumulative number of cases in Japan was 25 on February 5th, 45 on
February 6th, and 25 on February 7th, so the cumulative number of cases
fell by 20 on February 7th.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/33>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/33</a>]
However I found a pull request about the same issue, where someone
replied: <span class="quote">"If I remember correctly, the first batch
of infections on the Diamond Princess was counted to be part of <span
class="quote">'Japan'</span> prior to it being split out. This article
on evening of Feb 6th (JST) mentions the total (at that time) on the
cruise of 20 known infections. Regardless would be good to remove this
from the JP timeline, and ensuring it is counted in the Others
aggregate."</span>
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pull/89>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pull/89</a>]
In a README file at the JHU's GitHub repository, there's also the
following entry under March 1st 2020: <span class="quote">"Diamond
Princess| All cases of COVID-19 in repatriated US citizens from the
Diamond Princess are grouped together, and their location is currently
designated at the ship's port location off the coast of Japan. These
individuals have been assigned to various quarantine locations (in
military bases and hospitals) around the US. This grouping is consistent
with the CDC."</span>
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/README.md>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/README.md</a>]</p>
<p>If the JHU's case numbers were simulated like Jockthedog2 and Jikky
suggested, then why do the case numbers match the numbers published in
other sources? For example in the Europe CDC's situation report for
February 1st which includes the EEA and UK, there's 7 cases listed in
Germany, 6 in France, 2 in Italy and UK, and 1 in Finland, Spain, and
Sweden.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200201140459/https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea>http://web.archive.org/web/20200201140459/https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea</a>]
JHU's figures for February 1st are otherwise identical except there's 8
instead of 7 cases in Germany.
<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/02-01-2020.csv>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/02-01-2020.csv</a>]
However it might be because JHU included cases from some other source
besides ECDC or because JHU's data was updated later than ECDC's data.
The CSV file published by the JHU says that their data for Germany was
updated on 18:33 UTC, but the page on Europe CDC's website is titled
<span class="quote">"Situation update 1 February 14:00"</span>. The 8th
COVID case in Germany was reported on February 1st in Bavaria.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany#Bavaria>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany#Bavaria</a>]
On the website of the Bavarian health ministry, there's a press release
about the case which said in German that <span class="quote">"there are
currently (as of 6 PM) a total of eight known coronavirus cases in
Bavaria"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.stmgp.bayern.de/presse/aktuelle-informationen-zur-coronavirus-lage-in-bayern-bayerisches-gesundheitsministerium-8/>https://www.stmgp.bayern.de/presse/aktuelle-informationen-zur-coronavirus-lage-in-bayern-bayerisches-gesundheitsministerium-8/</a>]
From the source code of the website you can see that the press release
has the timestamp <code>2020-02-01T00:59:59+02:00</code>, but other press
releases on the website also have a timestamp that ends with
<code>00:59:59+02:00</code> so it's probably just used as the default time
for articles with a date-only timestamp. So if the press release by the
Bavarian health ministry was published at 6 PM in UTC+1, then it
would've been published after the ECDC's daily report but before the
JHU's daily data at GitHub was updated.</p>
<p>Jockthedog2 made it seem like the JHU's COVID dashboard was some kind
of a CCP-controlled operation because many of their programmers were
Chinese. But it might have something to do with how in the 2023
International Mathematical Olympiad, the six members of the US team were
named Lin, Liu, Lu, Shen, Wang, and Zhao.
[<a href=https://www.imo-official.org/team_r.aspx?code=USA&year=2023>https://www.imo-official.org/team_r.aspx?code=USA&amp;year=2023</a>]
And at the 2022 International Olympiad in Informatics, the members of
the US team were named Chen, Feng, Jiang, and Zhang.
[<a href=http://www.usaco.org/>http://www.usaco.org/</a>] In a paper by
Davide Piffer where he calculated polygenic scores for human populations
based on the frequency of alleles associated with educational
attainment, out of populations at 1000 Genomes, Han Chinese from Shangai
ranked first with a score about 1.61 SDs above average, but the score of
US whites was only about 0.76 SDs above average.

<p>When Jikky asked me if the JHU continued to manually add individual
cases based on news items and social media posts even in spring 2020
when there was a large number of new cases, I pointed out that the first
paper about the JHU dashboard from February 2020 said: <span
class="quote">"To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds,
online news services, and direct communication sent through the
dashboard."</span> But the second paper from August 2022 said: <span
class="quote">"As the virus spread internationally, data were manually
sourced and validated from a mix of official and aggregate sources,
including 1Point3Acres, BNO news, Worldometers.info, local news
reporting, and social media posts from governments and health
authorities. Eventually, governments and health authorities established
public bodies for reporting epidemic data within their jurisdictions,
which replaced ad hoc sourcing as they became available."</span>
[<a href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2822%2900434-0/fulltext>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2822%2900434-0/fulltext</a>]</p>
<p>In the appendix of the second paper about the JHU dashboard from
2022, the authors also demonstrate challenges that arise from
aggregating data that is published in different time zones: <span
class="quote">"The data collected and reported on the dashboard has to
follow a regular time interval to be useful for most data analysis. For
this, the dashboard produces graphs and products based on <span
class="quote">'per-day'</span> cutoffs, so the daily change in data can
be easily tabulated. However, producing a single product for all
locations across all time zones has presented challenges in selecting
the precise moment for the day cutoff for the generation of the time
series and daily report files. The cutoff time was initially chosen as
11:59 PM Greenwich Mean Time (UTC or GMT+0). However, this time
occasionally resulted in cases on the West Coast of the United States
not being captured, which was viewed as inappropriate for a US-centric
data effort. The cutoff time was then extended to 4:00 AM UTC, but this
happened to fall right around the update time for the Indian Ministry of
Health, resulting in cases sometimes being stale between two updates and
double-counting on the next day. Now, all daily products are generated
at 5:00 AM UTC. When these changes were implemented, historical data was
shifted to reflect this time cut-off for all dates. India, Pakistan, and
Mexico still occasionally update shortly after product generation, so
our system gives these countries an extra two-hour window in which their
updates will be applied to the previous day."</span>

<p>Jikky also asked me: <span class="quote">"For instance can you point
to the live feed of data from Australia during 2020 that fed the
dashboard?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1766963648726257908>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1766963648726257908</a>]
However in the latest version of the Readme file on JHU's GitHub
account, they list two sources for Australia which are the Australian
MOH and a website called covidlive.com.au.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/README.md>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/README.md</a>,
<a href=https://www.health.gov.au/news/coronavirus-update-at-a-glance>https://www.health.gov.au/news/coronavirus-update-at-a-glance</a>
and
<a href=https://www.covidlive.com.au/>https://www.covidlive.com.au/</a>]
The covidlive.com.au website was added to the README file in April 2020.
[<a href=https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/765856b3e1e8618effefc7c3acb267af2c79edec>https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/765856b3e1e8618effefc7c3acb267af2c79edec</a>]
Then Jikky said that the covidlive.com.au website didn't provide live
data. But in the case of their website, I think live data didn't mean
that they added individual cases in real time as they occured but rather
that they added the daily new cases for each region soon after they were
published by the region, as you can see from their list of updates:
[<a href=https://covidlive.com.au/last-updated>https://covidlive.com.au/last-updated</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-jhu-au.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>The website of Worldometers also says that their live updates meant
that they updated the daily totals for each country throughout the day
as new reports were published: <span class="quote">"Effective February
1, 2023, the Coronavirus Tracker had switched from LIVE to Daily
Updates. As a number of major countries had transitioned to weekly
updates, there was no need anymore for immediate updates throughout the
day as soon as a new report is released."</span>

<p>Jikky wrote this about the dataset for daily COVID cases by county

<p>The CDC has published a CSV file with about 10 million rows where
each row contains information about an individual COVID case, including
the county of residence.

The file only includes the month of each case and not the day of month.
However when I used it to calculate the monthly number of new COVID
cases by county, the results were similar to the NYT dataset:</p>

<p>The number of cases reported by Johns Hopkins University also matches
the NYT dataset. For example in Snohomish County on April 20th, there
were 2,162 cumulative cases according to NYT and 2,163 according to
JHU:</p>
<pre class=fullwidth>$ wget -q https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/04-20-2020.csv

<p>And the total number of cumulative cases in the US on April 20th was
also similar (and the reason why JHU's number of cases was slightly
lower might be that JHU's CSV file says that their data for US counties
was last updated on 11:36 PM UTC):</p>
<pre>$ awk -F, &#39;$4==&quot;US&quot;{x+=$8}END{print x}&#39; 04-20-2020.csv

784991</pre>
<p>However Jikky says that the case data by NYT and JHU are both <span
class="quote">"synthetic"</span>, so did NYT copy their data from JHU or
vice versa, or did they just use a similar algorithm to synthesize their
case numbers, or did both of them copy their data from a third source?
Jikky wrote: <span class="quote">"the JHU dashboard used synthetic data
generated by Ensheng Dong via DXY in China. The Chinese synthesised this
data in order to create a scenario where the world was driven into
lockdown whilst mainland China opened up, giving them the only GDP
growth in the world in 2020."</span>

So I guess in his scheme if the Chinese were also responsible for
synthesizing JHU's data for the daily number of cases by US county, then
the NYT and CDC would've had to copy their data from JHU (even though
Jikky didn't specify if the Chinese were responsible for synthesizing
all of JHU's data or only some of the data).</p>

<p>He linked this page as the source of his statistics:

class="uri">https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/</a>.</a>
However at the bottom of the page, it says that the source of the world
population estimates was the 2022 UN World Population Prospects dataset.
So the reason why the numbers haven't changed between 2023 and 2024 is
because they're taken from a dataset that was published in 2022.</p>
<p>The figure of 8,045,311,447 seems to match WPP's mid-year population
estimate for 2023 except for some reason it's off by one person:</p>
<pre>&gt; t=fread(&quot;WPP2022_Demographic_Indicators_Medium.csv&quot;)
&gt; t[Location==&quot;World&quot;&amp;Time==2023,TPopulation1July*1e3]
[1] 8045311448</pre>
<p>However just because Worldometers uses one old dataset somewhere on
their website doesn't mean that they couldn't have collected up-to-date
daily information about COVID deaths.</p>
<p>The World Population Prospects dataset was published in July 2022,
but UN's website seems to indicate that the dataset uses modeled data
from January 2022 onwards: <span class="quote">"In the 2022 revision,
the figures from 1950 up to 2021 are treated as estimates, and thus the
projections for each country or area begin on 1 January 2022 and extend
until 2100. Because population data are not necessarily available for
that date, the 2022 estimate is derived from the most recent population
data available for each country, obtained usually from a population
census or a population register, projected to 2022 using all available
data on fertility, mortality and international migration trends between
the reference date of the population data available and 1 January
2022."</span>
[<a href=https://population.un.org/wpp/Methodology/>https://population.un.org/wpp/Methodology/</a>]
The same page also says: <span class="quote">"For 74 countries or areas,
the most recent available population count was from the period
2005-2014. For the remaining 11 countries or areas, the most recent
available census data were from before 2005."</span></p>
<p>I'm not sure if all population data for 2022 is projected or not. But
I guess some of the data for deaths in 2022 is based on actual reported
mortality, because for example Ukraine has a 38% increase in CMR between
2021 and 2022 in the WPP dataset.

And Hong Kong also has a 16% increase in CMR from 2021 to 2022 (because
Hong Kong had almost no COVID deaths until 2022, but they had about 170%

from a censored PANDA presentation by Jennifer Smith</a>
</h3>
<p>In 2024 Nick Hudson published a video which had been recorded in 2022
but which he hadn't published earlier because the chicks in the video
didn't go along with his agenda that there was no pandemic. He
highlighted this sentence by Jennifer Smith: <span class="quote">"One of
the myths that was perpetuated over the last few years is that
SARS-CoV-2 was a novel coronavirus, something we haven't seen before,
and that is false."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hudson-censored-1.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However right after that part she also said that SARS-CoV-2 <span
class="quote">"has over 90% genome identity so it is similar to
SARS1"</span>, which was also mentioned in the slides of the talk.</p>
<p>However actually if you compare the reference genomes of SARS1 and
SARS-CoV-2, they have about 80.0% nucleotide identity if positions where
either sequence has a gap are ignored, or about 78.9% if not:</p>
<pre>$ curl &#39;https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;rettype=fasta&amp;id=MN908947,NC_004718&#39;|mafft --quiet --thread 4 -|seqkit seq -s|awk &#39;NR==1{split($0,a,&quot;&quot;);l=length;next}{split($0,b,&quot;&quot;);for(i=1;i&lt;=l;i++){if(a[i]!=&quot;-&quot;&amp;&amp;b[i]!=&quot;-&quot;){n++;if(a[i]!=b[i])d++};if(a[i]!=b[i])d2++}print (1-d/n)*100,(1-d2/l)*100}&#39;
79.9548 78.9479</pre>
<p>So if she made such a basic mistake, then maybe she wasn't qualified
to decide if SARS-CoV-2 was a novel virus or not. (But Hudson was still
willing to quote her as long as she said something that supported his
agenda, even though Smith said that the point of their presentation was
to debunk other people at PANDA who were downplaying the importance of
the virus, which might also explain why their presentation remained
unpublished.)</p>
<p>Smith said that she may have gotten the figure of over 90% identity
from a paper which included this paragraph: <span class="quote">"CoVs
have the largest RNA viral genome, ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length
[11]. The SARS-CoV-2 genome share about 82% sequence identity with
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and &gt;90% sequence identity for essential
enzymes and structural proteins. This high level of the sequence
revealed a common pathogenesis mechanism, thus, therapeutic targeting.
Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins, that include
spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
These proteins share high sequence similarity to the sequence of the
corresponding protein of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293463/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293463/</a>]</p>
<p>The E, N, and M proteins of Tor2 have over 90% amino acid identity to
Wuhan-Hu-1. But the authors of the paper made a big error when they
wrote that SARS-CoV-2 had about 82% sequence identity to MERS, even
though actually the reference genomes of MERS and SARS-CoV-2 have only
about 57% identity if you ignore positions where either sequence has a
gap or about 50% if you don't:</p>

<p>And if the virus had been circulating a long time before testing
started, then why are there no Chinese GISAID submissions from the first
half of 2020 that have more than 30 mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1? Did they
disappear in the same way that pre-Omicron strains mostly disappeared
after the emergence of Omicron?</p>

<p>In a study which analyzed nearly all COVID patients admitted to a
hospital in Shanghai up to September 2020, by March-April 2020 about 99%
of all cases were in patients who were considered to have been infected
outside of China:

<blockquote>
<p>We recruited nearly all clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed
COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center
during January 20th to September 17th, 2020, including the first case (a
male) who was diagnosed in Shanghai on January 20th, 2020 and from Wuhan
(Supplementary Table 1). These patients included 553 males and 380
females, with a median age of 36.00 years.</p>
<p>Based on the admission dates of these patients, the whole study
period was divided into three stages: stage I was from January 20th to
February 29th, 2020; stage II from March 1st to CCEPTED MANUSCRIPT April
30th; and stage III from May 1st to September 30th (Fig. 1A). Of these
327 patients appeared during the stage I, 266 cases were infected
domestically, 32 cases were diagnosed within 1-22 days after returning
or coming from abroad, but the remaining 29 cases had no clear
epidemiological records (Fig. 1B, Table 1). For domestic infections, 88
patients were infected in Shanghai, while 152 patients were from or had
a travelling history to Wuhan (130) Hubei province (22), and 26 patients
were from or had a travelling history to other 12 Chinese provinces.
During the stage II, 302 (99.01%) cases were imported cases, who came or
returned from abroad, mainly from Europe (231), while only three cases
were infected domestically (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly,
during the stage III, in addition to five domestical infections, 296
cases were infected outside of China, mainly from Asian countries and
regions (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). The epidemiological and

12th, the closest potential ancestor samples are all from the city of

<p>The biggest spike in COVID deaths was in the first quarter of 2022,
but it coincided with a period that otherwise had low mortality so it's
not clearly visible in all-cause mortality statistics:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hudson-denmark-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The spike in deaths in December 2022 was probably caused by influenza
viruses, because many other European countries like Germany and
Netherlands also had a similar spike which coincided with a spike in the
prevalence of influenza A but not COVID deaths.</p>

<p>However I pointed out that many counties in southern states had over
100% excess mortality in April 2020, and there were even some counties
that already had around 100% excess mortality in March:</p>

<p>He answered: <span class="quote">"The subdivision alone will create
areas of <span class="quote">'statistical significance'</span> with no
underlying causal effects. One needs a long time-line prior to any
intervention to gain a sense of just random variability."</span> However
I included all months of 2019 in my heatmap above for comparison to show
that there was no month with over 32% excess mortality in 2019. And I
also pointed out that many of the same southern counties also had high
COVID deaths per capita in spring 2020:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-akston-3.webp width=1100>
</div>
<p>I also pointed out that in the CDC's dataset for excess deaths,
Louisiana had about 69% excess mortality on the week ending April 11th
2020. And the spike in deaths was preceded by a spike in PCR positivity
rate by about 2 weeks:

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-akston-4.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>In fact Louisiana was one of the states with the highest PCR
positivity rate in March 2020:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pcr-states-heat.webp width=1000>
</div>
<p>In the plot below I included only fairly large counties with
population size of 100,000 or higher, and I excluded counties of New
York and New Jersey apart from NYC. But there were still 10 counties
apart from NYC where the peak weekly excess mortality reached above
250%. In spring 2020 there were around 300% excess deaths in Orleans,
Louisiana and Suffolk, Massachusetts. And in July 2020 there were over
400% weekly excess deaths in Hidalgo, Texas:</p>

<p>However I think the ICD code for <span class="quote">"Coronavirus
infection, unspecified"</span> (B34.2) includes known human
coronaviruses like 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, because they don't seem
to have their own ICD codes, but there's only an ICD code for SARS1. And
maybe testing for coronaviruses had become more common in the years
before COVID.</p>
<p>I asked Google Gemini: <span class="quote">"what ICD codes are used
for human coronaviruses like 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1"</span>. But it
answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two main ICD-10 codes used for human coronaviruses
depending on the specific situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>B34.2: Coronavirus infection, unspecified This code is used for
general cases of coronavirus infection where the specific type of
coronavirus is not identified or unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>B97.29: Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified
elsewhere This code is used for cases where a specific human coronavirus
(e.g., 229E, NL63, 0OC43, HKU1) is identified and it causes a disease
classified in another section of ICD-10. For example, if a patient has
pneumonia caused by coronavirus OC43, the code for pneumonia (e.g.,
J12.9) would be used as the primary code, and B97.29 would be used as a
secondary code to indicate the cause.</p></li>

<p>I don't know if the virus is supposed to have been sweeping the land
that long before excess mortality became visible on the county level in
March 2020, because according to OWID, the cumulative number of cases in
the United States only reached above 100 on March 3rd, above 1,000 on
March 10th, above 10,000 on March 19th, and above 100,000 on March
28th.</p>
<p>In March 2020 you can find high excess morality in the same counties
which had a high number of COVID cases per capita. When I calculated
seasonality-adjusted monthly excess deaths on CDC WONDER so that I used
data from 2018-2019 as the baseline, the county with the 5th highest
percentage of excess deaths in March 2020 was Cleburne, Arkansas:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/counties-excess-mortality-march-2020-cdc-wonder.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>However in the dataset for COVID cases and deaths by county that was
published by the New York Times, Cleburne, Arkansas was also the county
with the 23rd highest number of COVID cases per capita in March 2020 (if
the counties of NYC are excluded because they were aggregated together
in the NYT dataset):</p>

<p>When I looked at all periods of time at CDC WONDER, and I selected
the underlying caused of death U07.1 and place of death at decedent's
home, I got 84,401 total deaths in the whole of United States and 2,534
deaths in the five counties of NYC.
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>]
So NYC made up only about 3.0% of the total.</p>
<p>When I looked at the percentage of deaths in March to May 2020 with
underlying cause of death COVID, there were 37 states which had at least
10 deaths where the place of death was listed as <span
class="quote">"decendent's home"</span> so the number of deaths was not
suppressed. But out of the 37 states New York only ranked 30th highest
based on the percentage of deaths where the place of death was listed as
decedent's home:</p>

<p>However according to the dataset for COVID cases and deaths by county
that was published by the New York Times, even in 2020 there were about
25,000 COVID deaths in New York City out of a total of about 350,000
COVID deaths in the whole United States.

So I don't know if it's such a <span class="quote">"huge
proportion"</span>, because the number of COVID deaths per capita in New
York City was about 2.7 times the US total (from
<code>(25144/8.773)/(346050/329.5)</code>). The data for COVID deaths by
county published by New York Times ends in March 2023, but at that point
their dataset has 45,123 COVID deaths in New York City out of a total of
1,135,344 COVID deaths in the whole United States, so there's only about
1.5 times as many CODID deaths per capita in NYC as in the whole US
(from <code>(45123/8.773)/(1135344/329.5)</code>).</p>

<p>Smalley then said that the spike in deaths was caused by the vaccines
and not COVID, even though it occurred at a time when a low number of
new vaccines were being given in the UK:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-smalley-six-sigma-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>According to the dataset for all-cause deaths in England and Wales
that Smalley used, all-cause deaths in ages 15-44 peaked on July 20th
2021 (regardless of whether you look at single-day data or a 7-day
moving average).

<p>In fact on the week ending July 19th 2021, there was the highest
number of COVID deaths in ages 15-44 out of any week between February
2021 and December 2021.</p>
<p>There was also a spike in PCR positivity rate in England in late July
2022, because the 7-day moving average of the positivity rate rose from
less than 1% in May 2021 to a peak of 11.6% on both July 22nd and July
23nd, after which it again fell back to about 8% a week later:

<p>According to OWID which uses excess mortality data from the World
Mortality Dataset, Canada had negative excess mortality for the first
three months of 2020, which might explain why there was no clear
increase in excess mortality in 2020 as a whole. However according to
OWID which uses excess mortality data from the World Mortality Database,
Canada still had about 24% excess mortality on one week of April 2020
and about 13% excess mortality on one week of December 2020, and both
peaks in excess deaths coincided with peaks in excess deaths in the
United States:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-nagase-canada-2.webp width=600>

<p>In summer 2020 when Canada had close to 0% excess mortality, the PCR
positivity rate also remained below 1% for a long time. But the spikes
in excess deaths in spring 2020 and winter 2020-2021 both coincided with
a spike in PCR positivity rate. In many northern states of the United
States, the PCR positivity rate also fell below 1% in summer 2020, but
in southern states and Mexico there was higher excess mortality and
higher PCR positivity in summer 2020.</p>

<p>Norman Pieniazek did a video panel on Twitter with Jonathan Engler,
Jessica Hockett, and Martin Neil.

<p>At time 21:22, Pieniazek said: <span class="quote">"The origin of the
virus, in the paper that - Fan Wu I think was the name of the first
author - these people had of course at the Wuhan institute all fantastic
instruments, you know sequencers that they could get from various
institutes."</span> However the sequencing was done in Shanghai and most
authors of the paper were affiliated with the Shanghai Public Health
Clinical Center. Eddie Holmes said that the samples were sent from Wuhan
to Shanghai by train.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u94foNmpKE&t=17m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u94foNmpKE&amp;t=17m54s</a>]</p>
<p>At time 26:07, Pieniazek described the sequencing of Wuhan-Hu-1 by Wu
et al. like this: <span class="quote">"You put some kind of a master
sequence into the instrument, and then you do sequence it and check what
matches the sequence. Because it's very difficult to assemble something
from scratch. The pieces are small and there's so many combinations that
it's very difficult. So they - as they say - they had all kinds of bat
origin viruses. I don't think this kind of work would be permitted in
the United States."</span> However actually Wu et al. used MEGAHIT to do
de-novo assembly for the metagenomic short reads, and the first
30,474-base version of Wuhan-Hu-1 they published was the contig they got
from MEGAHIT (and it accidentally even included 618-base segment of the
human genome at the 3' end, which is a common type of assembly error in
metagenome-assembled genomes). Another page on my website has
instructions on how you can run MEGAHIT yourself to reproduce the
de-novo assembly from Wu et al.'s metagenomic reads:
<a href=hamburgmath.html>hamburgmath.html</a>. Wu et al. wrote: <span
class="quote">"Of the 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit, the longest
(30,474 nucleotides (nt)) had a high abundance and was closely related
to a bat SARS-like coronavirus (CoV) isolate - bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank
accession number MG772933) - that had previously been sampled in China,
with a nucleotide identity of 89.1% (Supplementary Tables 1, 2)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2008-3>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2008-3</a>]
But ZC45 wasn't used as any kind of a <span class="quote">"master
sequence"</span> during the assembly but it was just the closest match
for the de-novo assembled contig.</p>
<p>At time 31:30, Engler talked about how Corman-Drosten used samples of
SARS1 to test their PCR protocol because they didn't have samples of
SARS-CoV-2 available, and then he said: <span class="quote">"Somebody
found the sequences - maybe before it was published - somebody, in one
of these journals or something - a preprint server - got the sequence
from the Chinese before it was published - sent it to him. And then to
create plausible deniability about how they came up with it, they made
up this story about validating it against SARS and everything."</span>
However Corman-Drosten's primes and probes were designed to match both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS1, so how could their story have been that they
didn't know the genome of SARS-CoV-2 when they designed the protocol?
They needed to know the genome in order to choose primers which matched
it. In the paper by Corman et al., they wrote that they designed the
protocol based on Wuhan-Hu-1 and a few early sequences from GISAID.</p>
<p>At time 42:24, Pieniazek said: <span class="quote">"My wife actually
was on the committee that was naming - created the naming scheme for
HIV. And this is such a scam. But you know it from England, from those
WhatsApp messages, that let us invent a new variant to scare..."</span>
The WhatsApp messages by Matt Hancock were sent on December 13th 2020
UTC. When Hancock asked <span class="quote">"When do we deploy the new
variant"</span> and he wrote that <span class="quote">"We frighten the
pants off everyone with the new strain"</span>, I believe he was talking
about when they would roll out the news story about the Alpha variant.

News stories about the Alpha variant were published on December 22nd UTC
by The Guardian and BBC, which was 9 days after the WhatsApp messages
were posted.

<a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666</a>]
The Alpha variant was also known as the <span class="quote">"UK
variant"</span> or <span class="quote">"Kent variant"</span> since it
was first found in Kent and it first became widespread in southern
England. Alpha was already fairly common in December 13th when Hancock
wrote the WhatsApp messages, but it had not yet become a big news story,
and the name Alpha wasn't introduced until May 2021 but the variant was
initially called B.1.1.7. Wikipedia says: <span class="quote">"The first
case was likely in mid-September 2020 in London or Kent, United
Kingdom.[90] The variant was sequenced in September.[91] As of 13
December 2020, 1,108 cases with this variant had been identified in the
UK in nearly 60 different local authorities."</span>

about Alpha.

<p>A Substack post about the video by Pieniazek et al. said: <span

there is no <span class="quote">'clonality'</span> and each one has 30
thousand nucleotides and there are combinatorically infinite changes you
could potentially need to consider when creating a coronavirus[5]. It
therefore isn't possible to know what to change, via Gain of Function
(GoF), to make the virus behave in more dangerous ways."</span>
[<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/an-explosive-discussion-with-ex-cdc>https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/an-explosive-discussion-with-ex-cdc</a>]
However one idea for a GoF experiment would be to insert the N-terminal
domain of the pangolin coronavirus GD_1 into SARS-CoV-2: <span
class="quote">"PV bearing Pangolin CoV GD spike mediated hyper-efficient
entry into HeLa ACE2 and HEK 293T cells, yielding 50-100 fold higher
signals than Wuhan-Hu-1 PV (Figs 3E-G and EV1C). The shorter loops
observed in Pangolin CoV GD are analogous to the truncations seen in
SARS-CoV-2 variants (Fig 3D). Therefore, to investigate the contribution
of the NTD to Pangolin CoV spike activity we performed domain swaps and
evaluated PV infection (Fig 3H). Providing Wu-Hu-1 with the Pangolin CoV
NTD enhanced entry into HeLa ACE2 and HEK 293T cells and phenocopied
Alpha PV (Fig 3I). Conversely, Pangolin CoV spike with the Wu-Hu-1 NTD
exhibited greatly reduced infection (relative to native Pangolin CoV
PV)."</span>

Another idea would be to insert a second furin cleavage site to a virus
which previously had only one FCS, like in one study where introducing
an S2' FCS to IBV increased the mortality rate of 1-day-old chickens
from 10% to 90%: <span class="quote">"Mutation of the S2' site of QX
genotype (QX-type) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike protein (S)
in a recombinant virus background results in higher pathogenicity,
pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism when compared with
conditions in wild-type IBV (WT-IBV) infected chickens. In this study,
we present evidence suggesting that recombinant IBV with a mutant S2'
site (furin-S2' site) leads to higher mortality. Infection with mutant
IBV induces severe encephalitis and breaks the blood-brain barrier. [...]
One-day-old SPF chicks inoculated with the rYN [unmodified] strain began
to show clinical signs of sneezing and listlessness at 5 days
post-inoculation (dpi). One chick died in the rYN-inoculated observation
group during the experiment's observation period, conferring a mortality
rate of 10%, while chicks in the rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated group [with an
artificially introduced S2' FCS] began to show clinical signs of
diarrhea and unexpectedly neurological signs such as head tremor and
paralysis. Nine out of 10 chicks infected with rYN-S2/RRKR during the
observation period; the mortality was 90%."</span>

<p>The Substack post also said: <span class="quote">"They can create
thousands of virus combinations, but the problem is how to test these
creations. There is no way to test the billions and billions of possible
changes to a virus and identify which changes to the sequence are <span
class="quote">'bad'</span>. You need the phenotype, and you cannot
deduce the phenotype from the genotype. So how would GoF researchers -
E.g., EcoHealth alliance - know exactly what to create?"</span> However
you can see page 11 of the DEFUSE proposal for ideas on what kind of
changes to introduce to the viral genome.

It includes a section titled <span class="quote">"RBD deletions"</span>
which says: <span class="quote">"Small deletions at specific sites in
the SARSr-CoV RBD alter risk of human infection. We will analyze the
functional consequences of these RBD deletions on SARSr-CoV hACE2
receptor usage, growth in HAE cultures and in vivo pathogenesis. First,
we will delete these regions, sequentially and in combination, in SHCO14
and SARS-CoV Urbani, aitticipating that the introduction of deletions
will prevent virus growth in Vero cells and HAE. In parallel, we will
evaluate whether RBD deletion repair restores the ability of low risk
strains to use human ACE2 and grow in human cells."</span> And next
there's a section titled <span class="quote">"S2 Proteolytic Cleavage
and Glycosylation Sites"</span> which says: <span class="quote">"After
receptor binding, a variety of cell surface or endosomal proteases
cleave the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein causing massive changes in S

SARSr-CoV S gene sequences for appropriately conserved proteolytic

sites. SARSr-CoV S with mismatches in proteolytic cleavage sites can be
activated by exogenous trypsin or cathepsin L. Where clear mismatches
occur, we will introduce appropriate human-specific cleavage sites and
evaluate growth potential in Vero cells and HAE cultures. In SARS-CoV,
we will ablate several of these sites based on pseudotyped particle
studies and evaluate the impact of select SARSr-CoV S changes on virus
replication and pathogenesis. We will also review deep sequence data for
low abundant high risk SARSr-CoV that encode functional proteolytic
cleavage sites, and if so, introduce these changes into the appropriate
high abundant, low risk parental strain."</span> And next there's a
section titled <span class="quote">"N-linked glycosylation"</span> which
says: <span class="quote">"Some glycosylation events regulate-SARS-CoV
particle binding DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, alternative receptors for SARS-CoV
entry into macrophages or monocytes. Mutations that introduced two new
N-linked glycosylation sites may have been involved in the emergence of
human SARS-CoV from civets and raccoon dogs. While the sites are absent
from civet and raccoon dog strains and clade 2 SARSr-CoV, they are
present in WIV1, WIV16 and SHCO14, supporting a potential role for these
sites in host jumping. To evaluate this, we will sequentially introduce
clade 2 disrupting residues of SARS-CoV and-SHC014 and evaluate virus
growth in Vero cells, nonpermissive cells ectopically expressing
DC-SIGN, and in human monocytes and macrophages anticipating reduced
virus growth efficiency. We will introduce the clade I mutations that
result in N-linked glycosylation in rs4237 RBD deletion repaired
strains, evaluating virus growth efficiency in HAE, Vero cells, or
nonpermissive cells ± ectopic DC-SIGN expression. In vivo, we will
evaluate pathogenesis in transgenic hACE2 mice."</span> And finally
there's a section titled <span class="quote">"Low abundance
micro-variations"</span> which says: <span class="quote">"We will
structurally model and identify highly variable residue changes in the
SARSr-CoV S RBD, use commercial gene blocks to introduce these changes
singly and in combination into the S glycoprotein gene of the low risk,
parental strain and test ACE2 receptor usage, growth in HAE and in-vivo
pathogenesis."</span> (So in the last section they wrote that they would
test the effect of the mutations they introduce by measuring growth in
human airway epithelial cells, and by the in-vivo experiments they
probably meant infecting transgenic human ACE2 mice like in other parts
of the proposal.)</p>

Austria in 2020 or for Switzerland in early 2020, but in countries with
PCR positivity data available, the spikes in deaths coincided with a
spike in PCR positivity rate, and the PCR positivity rate was also low
in summer 2020 when excess mortality was low:</p>

<p>Neil et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"So, in Korea 45% of the
patients showed coinfection but, in the USA, it was reported as
significantly less at 3.5%. How can the same pathogen have such a
different coinfection profile?"</span> However the Korean paper they
linked was quoting a meta-analysis where the figure of 45% came from a
Chinese paper, so Neil et al. got the country wrong. The Chinese paper
had a sample size of 40, where the table featured in the meta-analysis
indicated that 14 patients had <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and one
patient had <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (giving a total of 15/40).
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245213/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245213/</a>]
However if you read the Chinese paper, it just indicated that they found
mycoplasma in 14 patients and not specifically <em>Mycoplasma

(But I don't know if it means that the Chinese study only tested for
<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and not other species of mycoplasma,
because the meta-analysis also quoted another Chinese preprint which
found a high prevalence of <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> in COVID
patients: <span class="quote">"The most common respiratory pathogens
detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%)
and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by <em>mycoplasma

<p>As a source for the figure of 3.5%, Neil et al. quoted two different
papers which both happened to feature the same figure. The other paper
from the UK only looked at the prevalence of <span
class="quote">"invasive pneumococcal disease"</span> where I belive they
only tested for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (which is also known
as pneumococcus).

The second paper they quoted was a meta-analysis which included 24
papers, out of which 19 were from China, 2 from USA, and 3 from other
countries (so that's another paper where Neil et al. got the country
wrong). But anyway, the meta-analysis said: <span class="quote">"In the
random effects meta-analysis bacterial co-infection was identified in
3.5% of patients (95%CI 0.4-6.7%) and bacterial secondary infection was
identified in 14.3% of patients (95%CI 9.6-18.9%). When pooling all

infection was 6.9% (95%CI 4.3-9.5%) (Fig. 2)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832079/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832079/</a>]
In case you're wondering how a co-infection is different from a
secondary infection, the meta-analysis said: <span
class="quote">"Bacterial infection was defined as an acute infection
including either (a) co-infection on presentation, or (b) secondary
infection emerging during the course of illness or hospital
stay."</span> Other studies did not differentiate between coinfections
and secondary infections. And in the studies that did, it could be that
some patients had a bacterial infection on presentation but it was not
counted as a coinfection if it was not diagnosed on presentation. And
the meta-analysis said that it looked at the prevalence of <span
class="quote">"acute infections"</span>, which might mean that they
didn't include studies where the subjects were simply tested for the
presence of bacteria that cause pneumonia, like in the Chinese study
where Neil et al. got the figure of 45% from.</p>

<p>There's a really stupid logical fallacy here: <span
class="quote">"When we look at the microbiological isolates taken from
patients suffering from VAP we find that gram-positive bacteria are
present in covid-19 patients at a statistically significantly higher
rate compared to non-covid-19 patients. <em>Streptococcus

significantly higher presence of pneumonia (caused by this pathogen) in
this cohort, which the authors fail to discuss."</span> (I hope the
logical fallacy came from the pen of the coauthor who had a PhD in
social sciences and not from the professors specialized in math and
statistics.)</p>
<p>The paper didn't say anything about <em>Streptococcus
pneumoniae</em>, but it did mention <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>,
which is also gram-positive, which is frequently found in the upper
respiratory tract, and which was not listed separately in the table that
showed the percentage of gram-positive bacteria. The paper said: <span
class="quote">"VAP is a life-threatening disease associated with high
mortality rates (43%) [5]. It is sustained by different microorganisms,
especially <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>,

So some of the COVID patients who tested positive for gram-positive
bacteria may have tested positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or
other bacteria. And you can't deduce that the patients tested positive
for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Neil et al. wrote that <span class="quote">"Fauci et al believe that
the 1918 pandemic was largely caused by pneumonia"</span> (by which I
presume they meant bacterial pneumonia). However I don't think it's
necessarily a fair characterization of the hypothesis presented in the
paper from 2008 where Fauci was the last author. The paper said that
<span class="quote">"The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza
pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia
caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria."</span>
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/</a>]
But that doesn't imply that it wasn't the H1N1 virus which caused the
pandemic, since Fauci and his coauthors presumably didn't believe that
the pandemic started because some species of bacteria circulated around
the world.</p>
<p>And later the paper also said that the 1957 influenza pandemic was
caused by a virus even though <span class="quote">"most 1957-1958 deaths
were attributable to secondary bacterial pneumonia"</span>: <span
class="quote">"The viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 pandemics were
descendants of the 1918 virus in which 3 (the 1957 virus) or 2 (the 1968
virus) new avian gene segments had been acquired by reassortment [21].
Although lower pathogenicity resulted in far fewer deaths, hence fewer
autopsies, most 1957-1958 deaths were attributable to secondary
bacterial pneumonia, as had been the case in 1918."</span> So it can be
simultaneously true that the pandemic was caused by a virus but that
most deaths can be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the paper also referred to animal studies
where bacteria coadministered with a virus resulted in more severe
disease than bacteria administered alone:
[<a href=https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/7/962/2192118>https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/7/962/2192118</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe
influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be
an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and
bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918-1919,
without definitive resolution [26, 33]. The issue was addressed anew in
the early 1930s when Shope published a series of experimental studies
that involved the just-discovered swine influenza A virus: severe
disease in an animal model resulted only when the virus and Hemophilus
influenzae suis were administered together [67]. In 1935, Brightman
studied combined human influenza and streptococcal infection in a ferret
intranasal inoculation model. Even though neither agent was pathogenic
when administered alone, they were highly fatal in combination [68]. In
rhesus monkeys, human influenza viruses given intranasally were not
pathogenic, but could be made so by nasopharyngeal instillation of
otherwise nonpathogenic bacteria [69]. During the 1940s, additional
studies in ferrets, mice, and rats established that the influenza virus
in combination with any of several pneumopathic bacteria acted
synergistically to produce either a higher incidence of disease, a
higher death rate, or a shortened time to death [70-73]; these effects
could be mitigated or eliminated if antibiotics were given shortly after
establishment of combined infection [73]. More recent data suggest that
influenza vaccination may prevent bacterial disease [74].</p>

hospital saying: <span class="quote">'Can we have your samples? I want

January 3rd, and this - he was in Shanghai at that point - so they were
sent on a train from Wuhan to Shanghai. He's sent seven samples and he
put them on the sequencer on January 3rd."</span>

And Holmes also said that he heard that the plan of the Chinese
authorities was to not announce the identity of the virus until the
Lunar New Year, which fell on January 25th in 2020, and he said that
Yongzhen Zhang actually got in major trouble for publishing the genome
before then: <span class="quote">"I heard was they wanted to have - it's
maybe a rumor - but I heard they wanted to have the whole thing kind of
tied up by Lunar New Year, and to have one big announcement saying <span
class="quote">'here's the virus, we've solved the problem, here it all
is'</span>, you know, bow-tied, post package posted - that's kind of
what I heard they wanted. And we kind of like, you know, we scuppered
their plans in doing that, and like I say there has been a lot of
fallout because of it."</span> [26:08] And Holmes also said: <span
class="quote">"Zhang was not the first person to sequence the virus,
okay. I don't know about the people that have done that as well - the
whole set of groups were - but so, Zhengli Shi had sequenced it -
actually probably before Zhang had sequenced it."</span> [31:01]</p>
<p>Neil et al. also wrote: <span class="quote">"Patient zero is
relatively young age and absence of significant health problems. Yet
patient zero was subjected to a battery of tests, including very
expensive genetic sequencing of fluid removed from his airways, that (we
are told) ultimately led to the discovery of a new coronavirus
subsequently dubbed SARS-CoV-2. This is not a routine medical response
to a typical respiratory infection."</span></p>
<p>However Eddie Holmes said that Zhang's team put the sample on the
sequencer on January 3rd in an unknown timezone, but at that point the
story was that the Chinese authorities already knew there was an
outbreak of pneumonia of an unknown cause but they had not yet announced
what the causative agent was.

So their motive for doing the metagenomic sequencing could've been to
find out the cause of the pneumonia outbreak. You can try searching
Google Scholar for <span class="quote">"pneumonia unknown etiology
metagenomic"</span>.
[<a href=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_yhi=2019&q=pneumonia+unknown+etiology+metagenomic>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_yhi=2019&amp;q=pneumonia+unknown+etiology+metagenomic</a>]
You'll find a bunch of papers where they had a case of pneumonia of
unknown etiology but they were able to find out the causative agent by
doing metagenomic sequencing, like for example there's one paper titled
<span class="quote">"Metagenomic Analysis Identified

(<em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> may also have been implicated in
some of the early COVID cases in Wuhan, because it was one of the most
abundant species of bacteria in the metagenomic sequencing runs of
WIV02, WIV06, and WIV07.) And there's another paper titled <span
class="quote">"Metagenomic analysis identified human rhinovirus B91

they wrote that the human rhinovirus B91 had previously remained
undetected because it's rarely reported to cause pneumonia.

<p>Zhang's team was not the first to sequence the genome, because other
samples had already been sequenced by December 27th local time by Vision
Medicals and by December 29th local time by BGI:

<blockquote>
<p>As early as Dec. 27, a Guangzhou-based genomics company had sequenced
most of the virus from fluid samples from the lung of a 65-year old
deliveryman who worked at the seafood market where many of the first
cases emerged. The results showed an alarming similarity to the deadly
SARS coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people between 2002 and
2003.</p>
<p>Around that time, local doctors sent at least eight other patient
samples from hospitals around Wuhan to multiple Chinese genomics
companies, including industry heavyweight BGI, as they worked to
determine what was behind a growing number of cases of unexplained
respiratory disease. The results all pointed to a dangerous SARS-like
virus.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Several other genomics companies also tested samples from patients in
Wuhan with the then-unidentified virus in late December, Caixin
learned.</p>
<p>Industry leader BGI received a sample from a Wuhan hospital on
Dec. 26. Sequencing was completed by Dec. 29, and showed while it was
not the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, it
was a previously unseen coronavirus that was about 80% similar to the
virus that causes SARS.</p>
<p>A BGI source told Caixin that when they undertook the sequencing
project in late December the company was unaware that the virus had
sickened many people. <span class="quote">"We take a lot of sequencing
commissions every day,"</span> the source said.</p>
<p>Caixin has learned that the Wuhan hospital sent BGI at least 30
samples from different pneumonia cases for sequencing in December, and
three were found to contain the new coronavirus. In addition to the
Dec. 26 case, the second and third positive samples were received on
Dec. 29 and Dec. 30. They were tested together and the results were
reported to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission as early as
Jan. 1.</p>
<p>On Jan. 1, gene sequencing companies received an order from Hubei's
health commission to stop testing and destroy all samples, according to
an employee at one. <span class="quote">"If you test it in the future,
be sure to report it to us,"</span> the person said they were told by
phone.</p>
<p>Two days later on Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued its
gag order and said the Wuhan pneumonia samples needed to be treated as
highly pathogenic microorganisms - and that any samples needed to be
moved to approved testing facilities or destroyed.</p>
<p>But that day, Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University in
Shanghai received biological samples packed in dry ice in metal boxes
and shipped by rail from Wuhan Central Hospital. By Jan. 5, Zhang's team
had also identified the new, SARS-like coronavirus through using
high-throughput sequencing.</p>

<p>Wuhan-Hu-1 was probably not even the first published genome, there's
two sequences at GISAID with a publication date on January 10th, and
GISAID said that they released the first genomes on January 10th 2020 at
00:41 UTC.

pneumonia is a common cause of death in children but COVID is not</a>

<p>Another problem with the theory that COVID was caused by misdiagnosed
bacterial pneumonia is that COVID deaths are rare in children, but Our
World in Data says that <span class="quote">"2.5 million people died
from pneumonia in 2019. Almost a third of all victims were children
younger than 5 years, it is the leading cause of death for children
under 5."</span>

<p>Neil et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"Furthermore, given that these
tests generated exceptionally high positivity rates, that climbed to 70%
and higher, it should be clear that the observed covid-19 case count was
dominated by testing rather than a genuine respiratory illness."</span>
[<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/whodunnit-unabridged>https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/whodunnit-unabridged</a>]
However if they would've tested a bunch of people who didn't actually
have COVID, then wouldn't you expect the PCR positivity rate to be low,
because isn't a high positivity rate rather a sign of a low number of
test performed relative to the number of people who were infected with
the virus?</p>
<p>I made heatmaps for counties of New York State which show COVID
deaths per capita, PCR positivity rate, number of PCR tests performed
per capita:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-new-york-state-counties-pcr-positivity-covid-deaths.webp width=0>
</div>
<p>In many counties in upstate New York which didn't have high excess
deaths in spring 2020, the positivity rate also remained below 10% in
spring 2020, but in some counties of NYC, the positivity rate reached
over 60% in March and April. In summer 2020 the PCR positivity rate fell
below 1% in many counties, even though in all counties the number of PCR
tests performed per capita was much higher in the summer 2020 than in
spring 2020. But on the other hand in August 2023 which is the last
month included in my heatmaps, some counties had over 30% PCR positivity
rate because the monthly number of tests was 2-3 orders of magnitude
lower than during the peak in testing in early 2021, so they're probably
no longer doing as many tests for asymptomatic people who don't have
COVID. In New York City, the number of PCR tests performed per capita
was about an order of magnitude lower in April 2020 than in January
2022, which might partially explain the relatively high positivity rates
in the spring.</p>
<p>But anyway, if PCR tests produce a huge number of false positives
like some people claim, then why are there many counties of New York
State where the percentage of positive tests fell below 1% in summer
2020 or summer 2021?</p>
<p>BTW from the heatmap above you can also see that in December 2020 or
January 2021, the number of COVID deaths per capita was almost as high
as in NYC in spring 2020 in some counties like Herkimer, Greene,
Genesee, and Seneca. But they were all counties which had a low number
of COVID deaths per capita in spring 2020, so maybe people in those
counties did not yet have natural immunity.</p>

<p>The post by Neil et al. featured the following map that was posted by
Justin Hart on Twitter on May 23rd 2020 UTC, with the text <span

<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-hart-us-map.jpg width=600>

<p>The map used data for COVID deaths and cases by county that was
published on the GitHub account of the New York Times.
[<a href=https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2020.csv>https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2020.csv</a>]
I believe the map was based on data from May 15th or earlier, because if
you aggregate the counties of New York City into a single county like in
NYT's dataset, then the five counties with the highest number of deaths
were the five counties that were colored red in Hart's map until May
15th:</p>

10     Middlesex Massachusetts   1347
&gt; sum(t2$deaths,na.rm=T)

<p>The total population of the five red counties in 2020 was about 18.5
million, or about 5.6% of the total US population in 2020 (if New York
City is again treated as a single county).</p>
<p>Neil et al. included the following comment about Hart's map: <span
class="quote">"For instance, by May 2020 the <span
class="quote">'pandemic'</span> in the USA had only occurred around a
few points that could have been pinned on a map, and everywhere else
failed to experience it."</span> However maybe a better way to find
which counties were the most impacted by the pandemic would be to find
counties with the highest number of COVID deaths per capita. If you
aggregate counties of New York City like in NYT's dataset, then on May
15th the three counties with the highest number of COVID deaths per
capita were all from Georgia:</p>

<p>Below I made a map similar to Hart's map where I divided the counties
to three approximately equal-sized groups based on the cumulative number
of COVID deaths on May 15th 2020, except I sorted the counties based on
COVID deaths per capita and not absolute COVID deaths. Now there's a
total of 30 red counties, and there's also a bunch of red counties in
southern states, and for example in Georgia there's a cluster where
multiple neighboring countries are red:</p>

deaths from the initial clusters of counties to neighboring
counties:</p>

<p>If the pandemic was fake and there was no viral spread and the deaths
were all caused by the protocols, then did the health authorities have
some kind of a system in place where they emulated viral spread so that
they first introduced the protocols in a small number of counties, then
next month they adopted the protocols in neighboring counties, and then
the following month they adopted the protocols in further neighboring
counties?</p>
<p>Compared to Hart's map, a better way to visualize which states were
the most impacted by COVID might be to just make a table of monthly
COVID deaths per capita for each state:</p>

<p>In April 2020, the number of COVID deaths per capita was the highest
in New Jersey, followed by Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York,
Michigan, and Louisiana, but Hart's map didn't even have any red
counties from the first three states. According to the data by CDC that
I used, in April 2020 even Louisiana had almost as many COVID deaths per
capita as New York State. The number of COVID deaths per 100,000 was
about 303 in New York State in April 2020, but it was higher in November
2020 in North Dakota and South Dakota, in December 2020 in South Dakota,
Ohio, Iowa, and Indiana, in January 2021 in Arizona, Alabama, and
Pennsylvania, in September 2021 in Florida, in October 2021 in Oklahoma,

<p>In order to find which bacteria are present in lung samples of COVID

metagenomic sequencing runs for samples of COVID patients. The runs at
the SRA have been analyzed with STAT (SRA Taxonomical Analysis Tool),
which provides an estimate of how many sequencing reads match each
organism in a taxonomical tree. You can see a graphical representation

<p>Interestingly, we found that the relative abundance of
<em>Prevotella</em> in the PDG was significantly higher than that in the
HCG, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to
<em>Prevotella</em> perturbation, which is consistent with previous
findings showing that <em>Prevotella</em> was the main bacterium in the
URT of patients with COVID-19 [28]. The relative abundance of
<em>Prevotella</em> in the CG was also higher than that in the HCG and
PDG, indicating that <em>Prevotella</em> dysbiosis persisted after
SARS-CoV-2 clearance in the patients who had recovered from COVID-19,
suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a long-term
effect on the alterations in oropharyngeal bacteria. This is possibly
because the oral cavity is one of the first entry points into the body,
and oral pathogens in the lungs can cause pulmonary co-infections;
respiratory viral infections increase susceptibility to secondary
bacterial infections of the lungs [29,30].</p>

<p>One of the most exciting findings of our study is that the relative
abundance of <em>Prevotella</em> varied significantly among COVID-19
patients (Pos), patients infected with other viruses (Sus), and healthy
volunteers (Ctr). The AUC of 0.669 between the Pos and Sus groups and
the AUC of 0.762 between the Pos and Ctr groups indicated that
<em>Prevotella</em> could function as a biomarker in distinguishing
between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and patients infected with
other viruses. Previous findings showing that <em>Prevotella</em> was
the main bacterium in the URT of COVID-19 patients (Wang et al., 2020)
and the decreased abundance of <em>Prevotella</em> in patients with
viral respiratory tract infections (influenza A, influenza B,
rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) (Edouard
et al., 2018) could support our findings. In addition, the relative
abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the Pos group was slightly higher
than that in the Sus and Ctr groups. The major bacteria contributing to
this phenotype were <em>Prevotella</em> and <em>Bacteroides</em>. The
oropharyngeal bacteria in samples with SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly
Gram-negative bacteria, especially <em>Prevotella</em>. This observation
is consistent with previous findings showing that Gram-negative
pathogens are the major cause of bacterial pneumonia in critical
COVID-19 patients (Dudoignon et al., 2021). More importantly, the
abundance of <em>Prevotella</em> in the Pos group was significantly and
positively correlated with the value of CRP (R = 0.55, p &lt; 0.01),
which indicated that <em>Prevotella</em> could function as a biomarker
in host immune response evaluation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p>Out of millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs at the SRA, the two
earliest runs I have found are metagenomic sequencing runs for the WHU01
and WHU02 samples, which were published on January 18th and submitted by
Wuhan University.
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA601736>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA601736</a>]</p>
<p>In the STAT results for the run for WHU01, the fifth most abundant
leaf node is <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, which is the most common
cause of bacterial pneumonia, even though the number of <em>Klebsellia
pneumoniae</em> reads relative to the number of SARS-CoV-2 reads is
about three orders of magnitude lower than the number of
<em>Prevotella</em> reads in the run for Wuhan-Hu-1
(<code>(233/48437)/(654784/54238)</code>). The second most abundant leaf
node is <em>Capnocytophaga ochracea</em> which a bacterium that causes
sepsis in immunocompromised patients. The third most abundant leaf node
is <em>Lautropia mirabilis</em> which is a bacterium that seems fairly
harmless based on its Wikipedia page:</p>

<p>The run for WHU02 also has such a small number of bacterial reads
that maybe the WHU01 and WHU02 patients didn't have bacterial pneumonia
(or I don't know if the WHU01 and WHU02 samples were sequenced using
targeted sequence enrichment, which can result in a huge increase in the
ratio of SARS-CoV-2 reads to other reads):</p>

<p>The WIV04 sample is supposed to have collected on December 30th 2019
from a retailer who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market.

WIV04 has an identical set of mutations to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
genome, and GISAID actually uses WIV04 as the standard reference genome
instead of Wuhan-Hu-1. The STAT results of the metagenomic sequencing
run for WIV04 are really weird though, because apart from humans and
apes, the most abundant leaf node is <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>,
which is a soil-dwelling bacterium that is the most commonly used
bacterial pesticide worldwide. The next most common species of bacteria
is <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, which is the cause of
tuberculosis, and the fifth most common species of bacteria is
Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a major cause of bacterial
pneumonia:</p>

<p>I next noticed that <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> is also found in
WIV02 (SRR11092058), so maybe it's just a contaminant. Here's the most

<p>There's also a second run for WIV02 (SRR11092063), but it also
contains a fairly large number of reads from <em>Bacillus

most abundant leaf node is <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>:</p>

<p>It's interesting that WIV02 and WIV04 both matched <em>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</em> which is the cause of TB. The matches be genuine
matches because there is estimated to be approximately a million cases
of tuberculosis per year in China.</p>
<p>Steve Massey ran Metaxa2 for metagenomic sequencing runs of WIV02,
WIV04, WIV05, WIV06, and WIV07, and out of seven groups of respiratory
bacteria he checked, <em>Prevotella</em> was dominant in WIV05, WIV06,
and WIV07:

<p>In WIV06-2 (SRR11092060), <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> was

Neil's emails about PCR from the Cigarette Smoking Man</a>
</h2>
<p>Martin Neil posted a Substack article about emails that he received
from his anonymous guru in 2020. He introduced the post by writing the
following:
[<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-smoking-man-emails>https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-smoking-man-emails</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those of you familiar with the cult 90s TV series the X-files will
recall the role of the smoking man, who like <span class="quote">'deep

truth to Mulder and Scully at critical points in their shared
adventures.</p>
<p>Back in 2020 I had my very own smoking man. He was anonymous but I
called him <span class="quote">"The Cleric"</span>. We started
conversing by email around September 2020, after I published some
articles in Toby Young's Lockdown Sceptics (LDS) website.</p>
<p>He sent me some long emails about the origins story of the so-called
pandemic with a special focus on the virus and PCR testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the emails were full of errors, and Neil introduced some
further errors in his Substack post by misinterpreting the emails.</p>
<h3>

German Instand report didn't show an overall 9% false positivity rate
for PCR tests</a>
</h3>
<p>Neil linked to a German report from 2020 where they took samples of
human cells that had been infected with either SARS-CoV-2, the human
betacoronavirus OC43, the human alphacoronavirus 229E, or that were not
infected with a virus, and the samples were sent to different labs which
did PCR tests for the samples using COVID tests by various
manufacturers.
[<a href=https://www.instand-ev.de/System/rv-files/340%20EN%20SARS-CoV-2%20Genom%20April%202020%2020200502j.pdf>https://www.instand-ev.de/System/rv-files/340%20EN%20SARS-CoV-2%20Genom%20April%202020%2020200502j.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>Neil wrote that the report showed that the PCR tests had an overall
false positivity rate of 9%, but he got the figure of 9% from a table on
page 50, which showed that out a total of 182 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2
which targeted the RdRp gene, 16 tests returned a positive result for a
sample of human cells that had been infected with the human
alphacoronavirus 229E:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-smoking-instand.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>So just because they got a false positive for a single gene doesn't
mean that the whole test would result in a false positive, since most
testing kits require a positive result for at least two or three primer
and probe sets. And the false positivity rate of samples that contain
another coronavirus is probably not indicative of the overall false
positivity rate for typical human samples.</p>
<p>On pages 28-31 of the report, there's results for samples of cells
that were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but positive for the human
betacoronavirus OC43, and their false positivity rates for different
genes were 3/373, 1/46, 2/48, 0/181, 0/100, and 0/64, which gives a
total of about 1.0%.</p>
<p>On pages 36-39, there's also results for samples that contained human
cells that had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses, where
the false positive ratios for different genes were 2/373, 2/167, 0/46,
0/48, 3/182, 0/100, and 0/64, which gives a total of about 0.7%. (But I
believe the Instand report didn't mention how many samples got a false
positive for two or more genes so that the overall test would've been
positive based on the number of positive genes required by each testing
kit.)</p>
<p>And anyway, if PCR tests would have a false positivity rate of 9%,
then why has the percentage of positive tests often fallen below 1% in
entire countries? The percentage of false positives cannot be higher
than the percentage of all positive tests.</p>

</h3>
<p>Cigarette Smoking Man wrote that <span class="quote">"the E gene and
N gene assays are controls against relatives of SARS-CoV-2 in the larger
family of bats"</span>. However they were not used as controls but for
some reason Corman-Drosten's protocol was designed to detect both
SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecoviruses. Corman-Drosten wrote that they grew
the Frankfurt-1 strain of SARS1 in culture to test their protocol, and
they wrote: <span class="quote">"Following the rationale that SARS-CoV
RNA can be used as a positive control for the entire laboratory
procedure, thus obviating the need to handle 2019-nCoV RNA, we
formulated the RdRp assay so that it contains two probes: a broad-range
probe reacting with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and an additional probe that
reacts only with 2019-nCoV."</span> In the preliminary version of their
paper, Corman et al. also wrote: <span class="quote">"All assays can use
SARS-CoV genomic RNA as positive control. Synthetic control RNA for
Wuhan virus will be provided shortly."</span>
[<a href=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/wuhan-virus-assay-v1991527e5122341d99287a1b17c111902.pdf?sfvrsn=d381fc88_2>https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/wuhan-virus-assay-v1991527e5122341d99287a1b17c111902.pdf?sfvrsn=d381fc88_2</a>]
So I don't know if part of the rationale of designing assays that
detected both SARS1 and SARS-CoV-2 was that they were unable to obtain
synthetic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 when they tested their assays.</p>
<p>The Cigarette Smoking Man also wrote: <span class="quote">"Including
results for E gene, N gene primers, and ORF1a(b) primers (for SARS-CoV-1
RNA), i.e. control primers that detect relatives of SARS-CoV-2, is
skewing the statistics, of course."</span> However I don't think SARS1
or other sarbecoviruses have been in circulation in humans during the
COVID pandemic, so they won't result in a skew in the statistics
either.</p>
<p>The Cigarette Smoking Man also wrote: <span class="quote">"These are
results for the negative sample, using the RdRP primers specific to
SARS-CoV-2"</span>. However in the primer and probe set which targets
the RdRp gene, the primers were meant to match both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS1
(even though the reverse primer actually matches only Tor2 but not
Wuhan-Hu-1), but there's two different probes and the other probe was
designed to only match SARS-CoV-2 and not SARS1 (even though it also
matches some SARS-CoV-2-like bat viruses which were published after the
Corman-Drosten protocol). So it's the probe and not primers that are
specific to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>The Cigarette Smoking Man linked to a page for Wuhan-Hu-1 at GenBank

chose, and which he claims are specific to SARS-CoV-2, are not found in
that genome."</span></p>
<p>He may have been one of the many people who didn't understand that
the primers and probes contain degenerate bases or that the reverse
primers match the reverse complement of the genome. So for example in
the RdRp_SARSr-F primer, the degenerate base R in GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG
matches A, so the primer matches positions 15431 to 15452 of Wuhan-Hu-1.
And the E_Sarbeco_R primer is ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA, but it matches the
minus strand, so you have to take the reverse complement by reversing
the sequence and swapping A with T and C with G, and then the primer
matches positions 26360 to 26381 of Wuhan-Hu-1. This shows you which
part of Wuhan-Hu-1 is matched by each primer and probe:</p>

<p>(In <code>seqkit</code> the <code>-d</code> flag which matches
degenerate bases cannot be used together with the <code>-m</code> flag

mismatches in the first command above because the degenerate bases are
treated as mismatches even though there's actually only 2
mismatches.)</p>
<p>It's an unsolved mystery why the RdRp reverse primer and first probe
for RdRp don't match Wuhan-Hu-1, and I don't know if it was simply a
mistake in the design of the assay. But it should rather result in false
negative test results and not false positives.</p>

Corman et al. design their protocol based on Wuhan-Hu-1 or other early
sequences from GISAID?</a>
</h3>
<p>Cigarette Smoking Man was wondering where Corman et al. obtained the
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 they used to design the primers, but then he
noticed that on a list of acknowledgements in the preliminary version of
the paper by Corman et al. which was dated January 13th, they first
listed Chinese institutes which had submitted SARS-CoV-2 sequences to
GISAID: <span class="quote">"We acknowledge the originators of sequences
in GISAID (www.gisaid.org): National Institute for Viral Disease Control
and Prevention, China, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China, and Wuhan
Jinyintan Hospital Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, China). We acknowledge Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang, Shanghai
Public Health Clinical Center &amp; School of Public Health, Fudan
University, Shanghai, China for release of another sequence
(MN908947)."</span></p>
<p>So therefore Cigarette Smoking Man concluded that <span
class="quote">"the virus RNA of, allegedly, SARS-CoV-2 was therefore
derived from a database upload in GISAID by Chinese researchers"</span>.
However Corman et al. actually wrote that the protocol was initially
designed based on Wuhan-Hu-1 (which was sequenced by Zhang's team and
which was published on the virological.org forum before GISAID), and
Corman et al. wrote that sequences uploaded to GISAID were later used to
confirm the protocol: <span class="quote">"Upon release of the first
2019-nCoV sequence at virological.org, three assays were selected based
on how well they matched to the 2019-nCoV genome (Figure 1). The
alignment was complemented by additional sequences released
independently on GISAID
[<a href=https://www.gisaid.org>https://www.gisaid.org</a>], confirming
the good matching of selected primers to all sequences."</span> So just
because Corman et al. acknowledged the people who submitted the
sequences to GISAID first and Zhang later, it doesn't imply that the
protocol wasn't designed primarily based on Zhang's sequence.</p>

<p>The Cigarette Smoking Man wrote: <span class="quote">"A research team
from the University of Graz collected random sea water from the Aral sea
in Kazakhstan, and ran popular RT-PCR screening kits against the sea
water."</span> However it wasn't seawater but samples from the dried-out
basin of the Aral Sea. And they didn't run PCR kits against the samples
but they checked which sequencing reads matched the primers by using the
Bowtie2 short read aligner.</p>
<p>The paper about the Aral Sea samples included the table below, where
the caption said: <span class="quote">"Two exact WH-NIC N-P alignments
were detected, all other alignments were reported with one
mismatch."</span>
[<a href=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/217720/1/Highly%20matching_Mora.pdf>https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/217720/1/Highly%20matching_Mora.pdf</a>]
So most of the primers didn't even have an exact match. And the WH-NIC
N-P probe which had two exact matches is only 16 bases long.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-mora.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>One of the two samples from the Aral Sea was called A53, and the
sequencing run for the sample has 112,791,242 reads that are all 150
bases long. In the simplified scenario where we assume that the reads
and the probe both consist of random nucleotide sequences, the
likelihood that a single 150-base read has an exact match to the 16-base
probe is <code>2*(150-(16-1))/4^16</code>, or about 7e-8, since the
number of 16-base subsegments of the 150-base read is 135, and each
subsegment can match the probe on either the forward or reverse strand.
And because there are about 100 million reads, the likelihood that any
of them matches the 16-base probe is
<code>112791242*2*(150-(16-1))/4^16</code> or about 7.1.</p>
<p>In 2020 people were making a big deal out of how in a PCR protocol
developed by Institut Pasteur, an 18-base reverse primer matched human
chromosome 8 (<code>CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT</code>). However
<code>4^18</code> is only about 7e10, and the length of the human genome
is about 3.1 billion bases, then the likelihood that a random 18-base
sequence would match a random sequence of 3.1 billion bases on either
strand would be <code>2*(3.1e9-17)/4^18</code> or about 9%.</p>
<p>In order for the PCR test to yield a positive result, it's not enough
that there's only a match for the reverse primer, but the forward primer
also needs to match, and the forward primer has to be located fairly
close to the reverse primer, and the probe between the two primers also
has to match. So therefore it doesn't matter that the single primer
sequences are fairly short because the combined length of the two
primers and probe is much longer. It's explained in a series of two
YouTube videos about the Institut Pasteur reverse primer from 2020.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2TTKM1NWDA>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2TTKM1NWDA</a>,
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOhqy-cxL0Y>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOhqy-cxL0Y</a>]
(Or actually if only the reverse primer matches but not the forward
primer, I believe the PCR test typically doesn't produce enough copies
of the amplicon for the probe to be detected since the number of copies
won't get doubled on each cycle, but I don't know if the probe might in
some cases be detected.)</p>
<p>You can run the following code to download the reads for the A53
sample and find reads which have an exact match to the 16-base WH-NIC
N-P probe:</p>

<p>So I actually found 6 exact matches in the forward reads and 10 exact
matches in the reverse reads, so I don't know why Mora et al. wrote that
they found only two exact matches for the WH-NIC N-P probe. So they may
have actually found an exact match for other primers and probes as well,
even though their Table 1 showed that they only found an exact match for
the WH-NIC N-P probe.</p>

<p>However according to OWID which uses excess mortality data from the
World Mortality Database, Paraguay had about 30% excess mortality in
February 2021 even though only about 0.2% of people were listed as
vaccinated at the end of the month, and two months later in April 2021
Paraguay had about 136% excess mortality even though only about 1.8% of
people were listed as vaccinated at the end of the month. And
Philippines had about 37% excess mortality in April 2021 even though
only about 1.4% of people were listed as vaccinated at the end of the
month. And conversely in Singapore the first big increase in excess
mortality came only in October 2021, but 50% of people had already been
vaccinated by June 18th.</p>
<p>In Australia the PCR positivity rate remained below 2% until the week
ending December 26th 2021, and three weeks later the positivity rate had
jumped up to about 45%, but in Australia the weekly excess mortality
percent also remained below 10% until January 2022 when it peaked at
about 27%. So the first big increase in excess mortality came almost a
year after the vaccines were rolled out but at the same time when there
was the first big increase in PCR positivity rate (just like what
happened later in 2022 in Hong Kong and Taiwan).</p>
<p>In Malaysia, Thailand, and Uruguay, the first big increase in excess
mortality also coincided with the first big increase in PCR positivity
rate

<p>Out of the countries which already had high excess mortality in 2020,
for example in Bolivia excess mortality peaked at about 245% in July
2020 the same month when PCR positivity rate peaked at about 58%, in
Chile excess mortality peaked at about 52% in June 2020 the same month
when PCR positivity rate peaked at about 31%, in Colombia excess
mortality peaked at about 61% in August 2020 the same month when PCR
positivity rate peaked at about 31%, and in South Africa excess
mortality peaked at about 42% the same month when the PCR positivity
rate peaked at about 25%

<a href=#Mortality_by_age_group_in_Peru id=Mortality_by_age_group_in_Peru>Mortality
by age group in Peru</a>
</h3>
<p>On pages 86-91 of Rancourt's paper which display the weekly number of
deaths and vaccines in Peru by age group, you can see that the peak in
deaths in early 2021 occurs around the same time in all age groups, even
though older age groups got vaccinated earlier so the peak in the number
of new vaccines was around April in the age group 90+ but around
September for the age group 30-39. So it appears to indicate that the
deaths were not caused by the vaccines, especially since in younger age
groups there were almost no new vaccines given at the time when the
deaths peaked. And next around January-February 2022 there was another
spike in deaths in Peru which also occurred around the same time in all
age groups, and even though it roughly conincided with a wave of
vaccinations in younger age groups, the wave of vaccinations occurred
much earlier in older age groups:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-peru-age-groups.gif width=600>
</div>
<p>From the plot below you can see that in early 2021 when Peru had a
large wave in excess mortality with two dintict peaks, the curves for
COVID deaths and PCR positivity rate also had similar shape with two
peaks. And around January-February 2022 when there was a short-lived
spike in excess deaths which soon returned back to around zero, there
were similar short-lived spikes in PCR positivity rate and COVID
deaths:</p>

mortality has higher correlation with daily PCR positivity rate than

</h3>
<p>I also selected countries from Rancourt's paper which had data at
OWID for all three variables out of excess mortality, PCR positivity
rate, and daily number of new vaccines, which only resulted in Brazil
and New Zealand in being excluded. Then I extrapolated weekly and
monthly variables into daily variables and I applied a 7-day moving
average to all variables. Then I calculated the correlation coefficient
of excess mortality with both PCR positivity rate and with the daily
number of new vaccines, so that I ignored days where either of the two
variables being compared were missing data (so that I did not treat the
daily number of new vaccines before the vaccine rollout as zero).</p>
<p>The correlation between excess deaths and PCR positivity rate was
above 0.4 for all countries except Argentina, where it was a bit under
0.4, and the correlation was over 0.7 in 8 different countries with the
highest being Uruguay (0.83). But the correlation between excess
mortality and the daily number of new vaccines was negative for 7
countries and positive for 8 countries, and it was over 0.7 for only a
single country which was Malaysia

<p>The plots for each country in Rancourt's paper only displayed excess
mortality and new vaccine doses given, but here's plots which also show
COVID deaths and PCR positivity rate:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-southern-deaths-pcr-vax.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>The spikes in excess deaths coincide with spikes in COVID deaths, but
if the COVID deaths were actually caused by the vaccines, then why would
people get a COVID diagnosis because of a vaccine injury? Was it that
they just got a positive PCR test when they were hospitalized for their
vaccine injury, in the case that the tests result in a large percentage
of false positives? But then why do many countries have periods when the
positivity rate has fallen close to zero? And if the PCR tests are not
picking up any real virus but they just randomly return false positives,
then why is the percentage of positive tests not more uniform across
time?</p>
<p>In many Southern American countries, the COVID deaths, excess deaths,
and PCR positivity rate all fell close to zero around September 2021,
even though some of the countries had a large number of new vaccines
given around the same time. For example in Chile the PCR positivity rate
went from less than 1% in September 2021 to about 32% in February 2022,
and at the same time excess mortality went from about 3% in September
2021 to about 63% in February 2022. And a similar pattern was also
followed by Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.</p>

with a lower percentage of vaccinated population had higher excess
mortality in 2021</a>
</h3>
<p>The plot below shows that countries that had a lower average
percentage of vaccinated population in 2021 tended to have higher
average excess mortality in 2021, with a correlation coefficient of
about -0.47
(<a href=stat.html#Plot_one_variable_on_x_axis_and_another_variable_on_y_axis>R
code</a>). Out of the four Asian countries, Singapore had both the
highest vaccinated percent and the lowest excess mortality but
Philippines had both the lowest vaccinated percent and highest excess
mortality. And in South America the two countries with the highest
vaccinated percent were Uruguay and Chile, but they were also the two
countries with the lowest excess mortality. (I only looked at data from
2021 because OWID is missing vaccination data for many countries in
2022.)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-southern-xy.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>I also tried making similar plots for the whole world, but I also
looked at the correlation between PCR positivity rate and excess
mortality, so I only included countries that had data in 2021 for excess
mortality, PCR positivity rate, and cumulative number of vaccine doses
per hundred. I only included countries with population over 5 million.
From the plots below you can see that out of the South American
countries which met my criteria, Chile had the lowest percentage of
positive PCR tests, lowest excess mortality, and highest number of
vaccine doses per 100. Countries and jurisdictions where both the PCR
positivity rate and excess mortality percent were close to zero were
Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, but their average
cumulative number of vaccine doses per hundred was around 40-60.
Countries where the average cumulative vaccine doses per hundred was
below 30 are South Africa, Guatemala, Ukraine, Palestine, Philippines,
and Bulgaria, but they all had above 20% excess mortality in 2021. So it
seems like low excess mortality was rather caused by a low PCR
positivity rate than a low number of vaccines.</p>

paper.
[<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-rollouts-all-cause-mortality/>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-rollouts-all-cause-mortality/</a>]</p>
<p>The article said: <span class="quote">"They also found that all 17
countries, which make up 10.3% of the global population, had an
unprecedented rise in all-cause mortality that corresponded directly to
vaccine and booster rollouts."</span> However in Ecuador and Bolivia the
highest excess mortality was in 2020 before the vaccines were rolled
out. So if Ecuador and Bolivia had further spikes in excess deaths after
the vaccines were rolled out, then were the spikes <span
class="quote">"unprecedented"</span> since there had already been a
bigger spike in 2020?</p>
<p>The article also repeated the claim that in 9 out of 17 countries
there was <span class="quote">"no detectable excess mortality in the
year or so between when a pandemic is announced on 11 March 2020 and the
starting time of the first vaccine rollout in each country"</span>.
However one of the 9 countries was Paraguay, where the excess mortality
reported by OWID increased from about -13% in June 2020 to about 22% in
September 2020, and around the same time the PCR positivity rate
increased from about 2% to about 30% and the daily number of COVID
deaths increased from about 0 to about 20. And another of the 7
countries was Suriname, which also had an increase in excess deaths
around August 2020 which coincided with bumps in both PCR positivity
rate and COVID deaths.</p>
<p>The article said: <span class="quote">"However, the researchers said,
<span class="quote">'In all 17 countries, vaccination is associated with
a regime of high mortality, and there is no association in time between
COVID-19 vaccination and proportionate reduction in ACM.'</span>"</span>
However for example in Peru, there were two huge spikes in excess
mortality before the vaccines were rolled out, but in January-February
2022 when the percentage of vaccinated people had reached about 70-80%,
there was a third spike in excess mortality, but the third spike ended
up being much lower than the two previous spikes even though the maximum
PCR positivity rate was higher than during the two previous spikes. (It
might be that people in Peru already had natural immunity at the time of
the third spike, but the reduced magnitude of the spike would still be
<span class="quote">"associated"</span> with a higher vaccination rate
even if the association would not be causal.)</p>
<p>The article also said: <span class="quote">"Also, all 17 countries
showed a strong correlation with higher rates of ACM in early 2021,
following the initial vaccine rollout and in early 2022, when the
boosters were rolled out."</span> However in Australia, New Zealand, and
Singapore, the excess mortality remained flat for most of 2021, and in
New Zealand it even decreased steadily from January 2021 until September
2021.</p>
<p>(But apparently the author of the CHD article had a Ph.D. in <span
class="quote">"human geography"</span>. Someone with an education in
mathematics or hard sciences would be more wary of claiming that some
statement is true for all 17 elements in a set, since the claim will be
false if there is even one element in the set for which the statement is
false.)</p>

<p>Rancourt et al. blamed the excess deaths around January-February 2022
on the vaccines, but on page 121 there's a list where they dismiss
alternative explanations for the deaths. One entry on the list says:
<span class="quote">"The peaks are due to aggressive Covid measures,
treatments or responses (other than vaccine booster administration)
applied in January-February 2022."</span> For which the answer is: <span
class="quote">"Unlikely. Covid measures, treatments or responses vary
widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do the demographics of the
populations at highest risk (e.g., Johnson and Rancourt, 2022). No
measures, treatments or responses were uniformly and synchronously
applied in January-February 2022 in the equatorial regions and the
Southern Hemisphere."</span></p>
<p>Out of the 17 countries in Rancourt's paper, there's only 5 countries
that have data at OWID in early 2022 for either the number of patients
hospitalized for COVID or the number of new hospital admissions for
COVID. The five countries are Australia, Bolivia, Chile, Malaysia, and
South Africa, but all of them had a spike in the number of patients
hospitalized for COVID around January or February 2022. (In Malaysia the
peaks for hospitalized patients, excess deaths, PCR positivity, and
COVID deaths only occurred in early March, but there had already been a
large increase in all statistics in Malaysia in February, so I think you
can still say that the peaks occurred <span
class="quote">"around"</span> February 2022.)</p>
<p>For example in Chile the peak in the weekly number of hospital
admissions was about 3,500 in February 2022 and about 4,500 in June
2020, but the peak in weekly excess mortality was about 63% in both June
2020 and February 2022. And since Rancourt presumably blames the deaths
in June 2020 on the <span class="quote">"protocols"</span>, then how can
he know that the deaths in February 2022 were not also caused by the
protocols?</p>
<p>When I asked Joel Smalley why spikes in PCR positivity rate coincided
with spikes in excess mortality, he said it was because people received
deadly treatment as a result of a positive PCR test. So in Rancourt's
model couldn't that also explain the wave of deaths that occurred all
over the world around January or February 2022? Apart from Malaysia and
Brazil which don't have data for PCR positivity rate at OWID, all
countries in Rancourt's paper had a spike in PCR positivity rate around
January or February 2022.</p>

<p>Rancourt's paper said: <span class="quote">"Unprecedented peaks in
ACM occur in the summer (January-February) of 2022 in the Southern
Hemisphere, and in equatorial-latitude countries, which are synchronous
with or immediately preceded by rapid COVID-19-vaccine-booster-dose
rollouts (3rd or 4th doses). This phenomenon is present in every case
with sufficient mortality data (15 countries). Two of the countries
studied have insufficient mortality data in January-February 2022
(Argentina and Suriname)."</span></p>
<p>I don't know if the reason why the peaks are supposed to be <span
class="quote">"unprecedented"</span> is that they occurred in the
southern-hemisphere summer. But I don't know how unprecedented the peaks
were, because in Colombia, Peru, and South Africa, there was a higher
peak in excess deaths in January-February 2021 than in January-February
2022 (at least according to OWID's excess mortality data from the World
Mortality Dataset). And Bolivia also had higher excess mortality in
January 2021 than January 2022 even though Bolivia is missing data for
February 2022 at OWID:</p>

<a href=#Plots_for_age_stratified_mortality_in_Chile id=Plots_for_age_stratified_mortality_in_Chile>Plots
for age-stratified mortality in Chile</a>
</h3>
<p>Rancourt et al. wrote that there was a peak in excess mortality in
Chile in July-August 2021: <span class="quote">"Detailed mortality and
vaccination data for Chile and Peru allow resolution by age and by dose
number. It is unlikely that the observed peaks in all-cause mortality in
January-February 2022 (and additionally in: July-August 2021, Chile;
July-August 2022, Peru), in each of both countries and in each elderly
age group, could be due to any cause other than the temporally
associated rapid COVID-19-vaccine-booster-dose rollouts."</span></p>
<p>However in the plots by age group for Chile on pages 72 to 75, I
don't see any peak in all-cause mortality in July-August 2021 that
coincides with a vaccine rollout. The peak in weekly deaths occurs
around July or late June 2021, but a new vaccine dose is introduced only
about 2 months later in August or September, and there is a sharp
decrease in excess mortality around the time when the new vaccine dose
is introduced:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rancourt-chile.gif width=600>
</div>
<p>In Chile the 4th dose coincided with a spike in deaths caused by
Omicron. The 4th dose was given a bit later to younger age groups than
older age groups, but the spike peak in deaths caused by Omicron
occurred around the same time in all age groups, so the number of 4th
doses given peaked before deaths in older age groups but after deaths in
younger age groups.</p>
<p>At OWID the peak in excess mortality in 2021 in Chile occurs a few
month earlier than in Rancourt's plot, but I think it's because OWID's
excess mortality data is adjusted for seasonality but Rancourt's plots
just display the raw number of weekly deaths, so at OWID there's lower
seasonality-adjusted excess mortality during the winter:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-owid-chile.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Rancourt's paper included a series of age-stratified plots for two
countries, which were Chile and Peru, but he included plots for all age
groups in Peru but only for ages 60 and above in Chile. The reason why
Rancourt omitted the plots for younger age groups in Chile may have been
if the deaths in younger age groups occurred before the vaccine doses in
mid-2021 or early 2022 were rolled out, because then he wouldn't have
been able to blame the deaths on the vaccines. I asked him why he
omitted the plots but he didn't answer me.</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out how to download data from the website of the
Chile DEIS which Rancourt cited as the source of his age-stratified data
for Chile. [<a href=https://deis.minsal.cl/>https://deis.minsal.cl/</a>]
When I try to click on the links on the website, it just loads
indefinitely or times out, and nothing happens when I click on the <span

<p>Rancourt calculates his <span class="quote">"vaccine dose fatality

new vaccine dose is introduced without attempting to account for COVID
deaths. His paper included the plot below which showed that the ratio of

</h3>
<p>In December 2024 Rancourt published a paper titled <span
class="quote">"Medical Hypothesis: Respiratory epidemics and pandemics
without viral transmission"</span>.
[<a href=https://correlation-canada.org/respiratory-epidemics-without-viral-transmission/>https://correlation-canada.org/respiratory-epidemics-without-viral-transmission/</a>]
In the paper he now seems to suggest that vaccines weren't responsible
for as many excess deaths as respiratory infection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the high-quality databases for the USA, there is a close match
between the weekly reported COVID-19 mortality and weekly excess
all-cause mortality, in the Covid period (2020-2022), including prior to
and during the vaccine rollouts (CDC, 2023).</p>
<p>To the degree that COVID-19 death assignation represents a serious
respiratory condition at death, and given the intricate weekly temporal
matching of the reported COVID-19 mortality and excess all-cause
mortality for up to 3 years in the USA data, this represents strong
evidence that respiratory infections were dominantly (virtually
entirely) associated with the excess all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Recently, Rancourt et al. (in preparation) analysed national
mortality data in one country in which COVID-19 vaccination status was
known at death, including the history of COVID-19 vaccinations, in a
case in which the country exhibited rapid vaccine rollouts strongly
temporally associated with observed surges in excess all-cause
mortality. They found that relevant <strong>peaks in excess all-cause
mortality associated with booster rollouts could not preferentially be
assigned to booster-vaccinated individuals</strong> (and also that the
vaccine had no detectable survival benefit).</p>
<p>This means that the COVID-19 vaccination primary cause described in
Section 3.3.5 did not produce a measurable increase in excess all-cause
mortality in this country, which in turn means that sharp peaks in
excess all-cause mortality which are temporally associated with rapid
vaccine rollouts need not imply that COVID-19 vaccination is a primary
cause of death. Rather, it seems that (as pervasive as they are) such
temporal associations between mortality peaks and rapid vaccine rollouts
are due to the primary cause described in Section 3.3.6 of campaigns and
measures associated in time and place with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.
Although non-conclusive in general, this is consistent with the fact
that the vaccine toxicity causing death inferred from populationwide
adverse-effect monitoring is usually too small to be detected directly
in populationwide (e.g., national) cause-independent all-cause
mortality, as per analyses of USA VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events
Reporting System) data (Hickey and Rancourt, 2022).</p>
<p>This would mean that the lethality of medical measures imposed during
the Covid period and during vaccine rollouts is much greater than
generally acknowledged, and much greater than the known (VAERS,
autopsies, etc.) vaccine toxicity itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 17 southern-hemisphere and equatorial countries he analyzed in
his paper in 2023, he calculated that there had been about 1,745,000
excess deaths since the start of vaccination and 1,388,145,365
injections, which gave him a ratio of about 0.1257% deaths per
injection. When he multiplied it by 13.5 billion injections worldwide,
he arrived at a figure of about 17.0 million deaths (from
<code>0.001257*13500</code>):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-17m.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>So in his calculation Rancourt assumed that all excess deaths since
the start of vaccination were caused by vaccines. But as of 2024 he now
seems to be saying that vaccines weren't responsible for nearly all
excess deaths worldwide, so he would probably need to revise his earlier
calculation as well.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Morris posted these replies to Rancourt:
[<a href=https://x.com/jsm2334/status/1865347944137834542>https://x.com/jsm2334/status/1865347944137834542</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-morris.webp width=550>
</div>
<p>After that Rancourt published a Substack post titled <span
class="quote">"Did the C19 vaccine kill 17 million? Yes, but how? Not
what you think!"</span>
[<a href=https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/did-the-c19-vaccine-kill-17-million>https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/did-the-c19-vaccine-kill-17-million</a>]
In the post he basically just repeated what he wrote in his paper,
except the new piece of information in the post was that he clarified
that he still maintains that vaccines killed about 17 million
people.</p>
<p>He seems to have suggested that there were not that many deaths
directly caused by vaccination but indirectly by measures or responses
associated with vaccination. He posted the following list of reasons why
deaths would've been associated with vaccination, where I highlighted
reasons why vaccines would've directly resulted in death in red, and I
highlighted causes of death that wouldn't have been even indirectly due
to vaccination in green. So is the majority of his 17 million vaccine
deaths explained by indirect causes similar to the causes I highlighted
in yellow?</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-morris-3.webp width=1200>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Added in November 2025: Rancourt now published a Substack post titled
<span class="quote">"Excess Mortality: What really caused it,
really?"</span>, where he wrote: <span class="quote">"Vaccine rollouts
often closely associate with large mortality peaks, but we attribute
this primarily to concomitant assaults and severe disruptions of care
rather than the known direct toxicity of the injections."</span>
[<a href=https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/excess-mortality-what-really-caused>https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/excess-mortality-what-really-caused</a>]
So he appears to still say that most of his 17 million deaths cannot be
directly attributed to vaccines.</p>

<p>Taiwan is somewhat similar to Australia in the sense that they were
almost free of COVID until 2022, but they had a minor outbreak in the
summer of 2021, which may have started among the crew members of an
airline company according to Wikipedia: <span class="quote">"However, an
outbreak among Taiwanese crew members of the state-owned China Airlines
in late April 2021 led to a sharp surge in cases, mainly in the Greater
Taipei area, from mid May. In response, the closure of all schools in
the area from kindergarten to high schools was mandated for two weeks,
and national borders were closed for at least a month to those without a
residence permit, among other measures.[26]"</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan</a>]
When I searched for GISAID submissions from Taiwan from May-August 2021,
154 out of 176 submissions were classified under B.1.1.7, and the region
of almost all submissions was either Hsinchu or not listed, so it
indicates that the outbreak was localized and it mostly consisted of a
single strain.
[<a href=https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Taiwan/AllSamples/from%3D2021-04-06%26to%3D2021-07-16/variants>https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Taiwan/AllSamples/from%3D2021-04-06%26to%3D2021-07-16/variants</a>]
So since Taiwan is a much smaller country than Australia, if it was
possible for a COVID outbreak to be localized to a single region of
Taiwan then why wasn't it possible in Australia?</p>
<p>However actually if you count the number GISAID submissions by
collection month, the outbreak in July 2021 is also visible to a minor
degree in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory. In Victoria
the number of submissions increased from 252 in May 2020 to 6886 in July
2020, but New South Wales also had an increase from 28 submissions in
May to 223 in July:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-puzzle-gisaidheat.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>The plots below also show that around September 2021, there was
another minor COVID wave in Australia which showed up as a bump in the
PCR positivity rate in Victoria, New South Wales, and Australian Capital
Territory, but not in other regions of Australia. (Australian Capital
Territory is a small region landlocked inside NSW.) So again if one wave
was mostly restricted to two neighboring state then is it so unfeasible
that another wave would be mostly restricted to only one of the
states?</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-australia-smaller.webp width=1300>

<p>From October 2020 up to June 2021, Australia had about 0.01% to 0.05%
positive PCR tests per month even though there were about 1 to 2 million

<p>So basically all samples with 8 or 9 mutations are from Victoria. All
samples with 10 or 11 mutations are also from Victoria apart from 3
samples from Western Australia. For 12 mutations there's 2 samples from
NSW, 13 from Victoria, and 5 from Western Australia. But 117 out of 119
samples with 13 mutations are from NSW, and all samples with 14 or 15
mutations are from NSW.</p>
<p>So it seems like the strain jumped from Victoria to New South Wales
around the time it gained its 12th or 13th mutation. The samples with 12
mutations have collection dates ranging from July 6th to August 12th,
and the samples with 13 mutations have collection dates ranging from
July 8th to August 20th.</p>

<a href=#Table_of_influenza_and_pneumonia_deaths id=Table_of_influenza_and_pneumonia_deaths>Table

</h3>
<p>Neil, Engler, and Fenton showed this table of influenza and pneumonia
deaths in Australia and wrote that it showed that <span
class="quote">"there was no significant change in respiratory mortality
and hence no pandemic"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-puzzle-1.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However their table didn't even include deaths where the underlying
cause of death was COVID. The spreadsheet they got the table from showed
that in 2020 there were 2,157 deaths where the underlying cause of death
was J09-J18 (influenza and pneumonia), but the same spreadsheet had 898
COVID deaths in 2020, even though Australia didn't even have that many
COVID deaths in 2020.
[<a href=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/2020#data-downloads>https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/2020#data-downloads</a>]</p>
<p>And if you look at the same data for 2022, there's 9,856 deaths where
the underlying cause of death is listed as COVID, which was almost 4
times the number of deaths under J09-J18 (influenza and pneumonia).
[<a href=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-release#data-downloads>https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-release#data-downloads</a>]</p>
<p>On CDC WONDER in 2020, the underlying cause of death was listed as
J09-J19 (influenza and pneumonia) for about 1.6% of deaths but COVID for
about 10.4% of deaths. So the ratio of COVID to J09-J19 deaths was even
higher than in Australia in 2022, as you might guess by comparing the
yearly excess mortality percentages:</p>

However in their previous post which they linked to, 25% was the rate of

<blockquote>
<p>The report he is referring to is written by the Doherty institute in
Australia by Tran et al. They tested the use of the Beijing Genomics
Institute (BGI) PCR test at three laboratories in June 2020 looking to
determine cross reactivity and found that the first laboratory was 100%
specific with zero cross reactions found (no surprises here - it was the
Doherty institute laboratory). The two other laboratories had
specificities reported as 99.1% and 97.5% respectively (and a cross
reactivity of 0.9% and 2.5% respectively):</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Furthermore, four samples from laboratory three were discounted
because they breached cycle threshold cutoffs, that only applied to
these tests. Here is the extract from the report describing this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by Laboratory 1. For
Laboratory 2, sample 253 (influenza virus A in saliva matrix) and sample
260 (coronavirus-229E in saliva matrix), were excluded from analysis
after returning invalid results (internal reference target Ct&gt;32 or
not detected). The remaining 22 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by
Laboratory 2. For Laboratory 3, sample 259 (coronavirus-OC43 in saliva
matrix) and sample 260 (coronavirus 229E in saliva matrix) were excluded
from analysis due to their internal reference target having a Ct&gt;32.
The remaining 22 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by Laboratory 3.
Of note were 4 samples from laboratory 3: sample 236 (parainfluenza
type-1 in saliva matrix), sample 246 (adenovirus type-5 in saliva
matrix, sample 181 (rhinovirus in VTM matrix) and sample 191 (influenza
virus A in VTM matrix) that generated a Ct value above 38 for
SARS-CoV-2. These were interpreted as not SARS-CoV-2 positive as per
manufacturer's IFU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the test report we have no idea what an internal reference
control target is but, taken at face value, it presents itself as a
convenient way to re-categorise false positives as true negatives, and
thus improve test performance by subterfuge. When these discounted false
positives are included the FPR-Presence, for laboratory 2 [sic; actually
laboratory 3], rises to 6 false positives from 24 samples - a whopping
25%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically in the study that was quoted above, they were testing a
PCR protocol developed by the Beijing Genomics Institute. They had 24
samples that contained non-COVID viruses which they sent to three
different laboratories.
[<a href=https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/06/post-market-validation-of-the-beijing-genomics-institute-bgi-sars-cov-2-real-time-pcr-platform.pdf>https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/06/post-market-validation-of-the-beijing-genomics-institute-bgi-sars-cov-2-real-time-pcr-platform.pdf</a>]
All three laboratories returned all 24 samples as negative. However in
the case of both laboratory 2 and laboratory 3, there were 2 samples
that were rejected because the internal reference target was not
detected or it was only detected at a cycle threshold of 32 or higher.
And in the case of laboratory 3, there were a further 4 samples which
yielded a postitive result but at a cycle threshold above 38, which
meant that they were classified as negatives according to the
instructions of the manufacturer.</p>
<p>So the Three Stooges derived the figure of 25% by ignoring two out of
three laboratories and by treating 25% of samples from one laboratory as
false positives, even though none of them were actually positive. They
should've at least pooled together the results from all three labs which
would've given them a false positive rate of 6/72 using their rules
(even though actually it was 0/72).</p>
<p>The Three Stooges wrote that <span class="quote">"we have no idea
what an internal reference control target is"</span>. But in the BGI PCR
kit, an assay which targets the human beta-actin gene is used as the
internal control, so that it is designed to always yield a positive
result for a sample which contains a sufficient amount of human DNA.
[<a href=https://www.bgi.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/IFU-Real-Time-Fluorescent-RT-PCR-Kit-for-Detecting-SARS-CoV-2.pdf>https://www.bgi.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/IFU-Real-Time-Fluorescent-RT-PCR-Kit-for-Detecting-SARS-CoV-2.pdf</a>]
The cycle threshold at which the internal control gets a positive result
can be used as an indication of the amount of human genetic material in
the sample.</p>

<p>The documentation for ArcGIS Online says: <span class="quote">"For

<p>When these two quotes are combined with the fact that Gardner was
reported to be so busy managing the dashboard in early 2020 that she had
no time to do anything else, it is certain that the modelling work was
for the dashboard. Indeed, and as one article pointed out, <span

been so consumed with dashboard maintenance that they've had little time
to analyze the data it actually shows"</span>

<p>Verduyn quoted from a bio of Gardner from the JHU's website. When I
looked up archived versions of the bio, the text about how she was
leading COVID modeling efforts wasn't even included in her bio until
January 2023, but it was missing from the previous snapshot from October
2022.

<p>And in any case the modeling Gardner did wouldn't have necessarily
referred to the JHU dashboard, because she was also the senior author of
a preprint published in May 2020 where the authors modeled the effects
of social distancing, titled <span class="quote">"Social Distancing is
Effective at Mitigating COVID-19 Transmission in the United
States"</span>.

In June 2020 she tweeted a link to the paper and said that she was going
to use a similar approach in another modeling project: <span

<p>Verduyn claimed that <span class="quote">"it typically takes ten
years to get accurate data on a specific illness"</span>. His claim was
probably based on his earlier comment where he wrote that <span
class="quote">"the Human Mortality Database, which tracks mortality by
country, is regularly ten years behind for many countries [15]"</span>,
and he linked to HMD's data for Russia which ended in 2014.
[<a href=https://www.mortality.org/Country/HCDCountry?cntr=RUS>https://www.mortality.org/Country/HCDCountry?cntr=RUS</a>]</p>
<p>However that's not because it takes 10 years for Russia to report
mortality data but because the source that HMD used for Russia only
extended up to 2014. The main HMD dataset provides long-term yearly
mortality data that sometimes extends back to the 1800s. However HMD
also publishes the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations dataset, which
includes weekly data for Russia up to the end of the year 2020.
[<a href=https://mortality.org/Data/STMF>https://mortality.org/Data/STMF</a>]
And Dmitry Kobak has published monthly data for deaths in Russia up to
June 2023.
[<a href=https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality/blob/main/russian-data/russia-monthly-deaths-preliminary.csv>https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality/blob/main/russian-data/russia-monthly-deaths-preliminary.csv</a>]</p>
<p>The main HMD dataset also has data for Ukraine only up to 2013,
Israel up to 2016, and Belarus up to 2018, but for all other countries
the data extends at least up to 2019. But there's of course more
up-to-date data available from other sources, and in any case I wouldn't
say that a 10-year delay is typical.</p>

(The reason why later weeks are not included might be because there's
too many deaths missing due to a registration delay.)</p>
<p>Verduyn also asked: <span class="quote">"If it currently takes two or
three years for a federally funded organisation such as StatsCan to
publish mortality data, how was it possible for JHU to get Covid death
data in real time?"</span> However even deaths from MERS were reported
in the media with little delay. Before MERS-CoV was named, it used to be
known as <span class="quote">"novel coronavirus"</span> or <span
class="quote">"nCoV"</span> or even <span class="quote">"novel SARS-like
coronavirus"</span>. So if you search Twitter for
<code>until:2012-12-31 novel coronavirus deaths</code>, you can find
reports about early MERS deaths.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2012-12-31%20novel%20coronavirus%20deaths&src=typed_query&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2012-12-31%20novel%20coronavirus%20deaths&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a>]
The WHO published reports about MERS cases and deaths.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20130913011723/https://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_09_07/en/index.html>http://web.archive.org/web/20130913011723/https://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_09_07/en/index.html</a>]
The Saudi MOH also published press releases about new MERS cases and
deaths.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20131001141127/http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CoronaNew/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx>http://web.archive.org/web/20131001141127/http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CoronaNew/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx</a>]
So if someone would've wanted to make a dashboard of MERS deaths in
2012, they could've just checked for tweets about MERS or the reports by
the WHO or the Saudi MOH.</p>

<p>However when I googled for <code>norovirus dashboard</code>, one of
the first results was a norovirus dashboard hosted at ArcGIS Online:
[<a href=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f3477f6a4ebb4b6f9c6de688b3dffdfd>https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f3477f6a4ebb4b6f9c6de688b3dffdfd</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>Even though there weren't that many cases yet on January 22nd, COVID
was already big news that day. That was the first day when Alex Jones
and Mike Adams made COVID into the main topic of their shows. That day
Mike Adams was already saying that the coronavirus was a genetically
engineered bioweapon, and he talked about Neil Ferguson's modeling study
which had been published earlier the same day, he mentioned the case of
the Snohomish County man, and he talked about how the Pirbright
Institute issued a patent for a coronavirus vaccine in 2015 (even though
actually it was a patent for avian infectious bronchitis virus, but I
think that story was deliberate disinfo which originated from the Qtard
Jordan Sather).
[<a href=https://www.brighteon.com/3ab86f6b-24a5-4125-bdbb-814baaaa791a>https://www.brighteon.com/3ab86f6b-24a5-4125-bdbb-814baaaa791a</a>]</p>
<p>Before January 22nd, Chinese websites were publishing daily maps
which showed the number of COVID cases and deaths in different
administrative divisions of China.
[<a href=https://www.163.com/dy/article/F3EP00E40519DDQ2.html>https://www.163.com/dy/article/F3EP00E40519DDQ2.html</a>]</p>
<p>There's also a Chinese interactive COVID dashboard at sy72.com.
[<a href=https://www.sy72.com/newpneumonia.asp>https://www.sy72.com/newpneumonia.asp</a>]
The front page of the website said this in Chinese: <span
class="quote">"The epidemic data system has been running for 1547
days"</span>. [<a href=https://www.sy72.com/>https://www.sy72.com/</a>]
I viewed the website on April 16th 2024 Chinese time, and 1547 days
before it would be January 21st (even though the current day would be
the 1547th day starting from January 22nd inclusive). So regardless of
which date it means, the sy72 dashboard may have even launched before
the JHU's dashboard.</p>

<p>However the dashboard was hosted at ArcGIS Online and not on JHU's

<a href=https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html>coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</a>,
the dashboard no longer even works but it just says <span

<p>The Wayback Machine's earliest snapshot of the coronavirus.jhu.edu
website is only from March 4th UTC. And if you search for early
references to the dashboard on Twitter, they go to arcgis.com directly
and not to the page on JHU's website where the ArcGIS dashboard was
later embedded:

<p>In a blog post about the dashboard dated January 23rd, the link to
the dashboard also went to the page at arcgis.com:

<p>The first version of the dashboard was not much more complicated than
a shared map at Google Maps, where there were pins for different Chinese
regions where you could see the number of cases and deaths when you
clicked on the pin. But even if a shared map like that got a huge amount
of traffic at Google Maps, it probably wouldn't crash Google Maps.</p>
<p>In addition to the pins, the first version of the dashboard had a
sidebar that showed the total number of cases and deaths and that listed
the latest updates to the data, but it wasn't much more complex than
that. Here's an early screenshot of the dashboard from January 22nd UTC:

<p>The lead author of the JHU's dashboard was Ensheng Dong, who was
probably familiar with ArcGIS before COVID, because his LinkedIn profile
says that worked as a GIS specialist from 2018-2019 before he started
working at the JHU, and that in 2015 he worked as an internee at Esri
which is the company that develops ArcGIS, and in 2013-2016 he worked as
a teaching assistant for college courses about GIS.

<p>Verduyn was also wondering how the JHU were able to publish the
dashboard so quickly, or if it really took them only a couple of hours
to make it. But for example about 34 hours after Steve Kirsch had
published Barry Young's New Zealand data, WelcomeTheEagle had already
published a Tableau dashboard for browsing the data, which was more
complex than the first version of the JHU dashboard.

data from DXY every 15 minutes: <span class="quote">"Every 15 min, the
cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China
and for other affected countries and regions."</span> Different Chinese
regions didn't necessarily submit new data every 15 minutes, but maybe
for example there were only daily updates for each region, but different
regions published the updates at different times of the day.</p>
<p>On the website covidlive.com.au which JHU listed as one of their
sources for Australia, the daily number of new cases in different
regions of Australia was updated at different times of the day, but new
cases for each region were only added once each day. For example on
March 29th 2020, the daily new cases were added at 11:23 AM for
Victoria, 11:38 AM for New South Wales, and 8:19 PM for Tasmania:

</div>
<p>So if JHU would've wanted to update their regional data for Australia
soon after the data was added to the covidlive.com.au website, JHU could
have checked the website for new updates every 15 minutes. So then they
would've been able to add new cases for Victoria at 11:30 AM Australian
time, for New South Wales at 11:45 AM, and so on (or maybe a few minutes
later depending on what kind of delays their processing pipeline
had).</p>
<p>But that wouldn't mean that new cases for Australia would be added
within 15 minutes from when they first occurred.</p>
<p>So similarly the reason why JHU checked for updates to DXY every 15
minutes might have been if DXY updated their data for different
administrative divisions of China at different times of the day.</p>

<p>Worldometers says: <span class="quote">"Effective February 1, 2023,
the Coronavirus Tracker had switched from LIVE to Daily Updates. As a
number of major countries had transitioned to weekly updates, there was
no need anymore for immediate updates throughout the day as soon as a
new report is released."</span>
[<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</a>]
So I believe <span class="quote">"live"</span> data didn't mean that
they added individual cases in real time, but just that they added daily
reports for each country soon after they were published. The list of
daily new reports added can be seen here:
<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news.><a
href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news"
class="uri">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news</a>.</a> For
example on April 12th 2024 their list of updates shows that they added
16 new deaths for Germany, which matches the number of deaths in the
file they cited as their source.

<p>Verduyn wrote that a full list of sources used by Worldometers was

2 weeks.
[<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news</a>]
So you might be able to compile a complete or near complete list of
their news updates through the Wayback Machine. Archives of the updates
are only available for January and February 2020, but they generally
include links to the source of the data.
[<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/feb-2020-news-updates-covid19/>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/feb-2020-news-updates-covid19/</a>]</p>
<p>But anyway, if the data at Worldometers was simulated, then why would
they bother exhaustively linking to the sources of new cases they aded
each day? And how would they be able to get the simulated number of
cases to match the number of cases mentioned in the sources they linked?
Wouldn't it be easier to just report real the data?</p>
<p>The about page at Worldometers says
(<a href=https://www.worldometers.info/about/>https://www.worldometers.info/about/</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the COVID-19 data, we collect data from official reports,
directly from Government's communication channels or indirectly, through
local media sources when deemed reliable. We provide the source of each
data update in the <span class="quote">"Latest Updates"</span> (News)
section. Timely updates are made possible thanks to the participation of
users around the world and to the dedication of a team of analysts and
researchers who validate data from an ever-growing list of over 5,000
sources.</p>
<p>For the live counters on the home page, we elaborate instead a
real-time estimate through our proprietary algorithm which processes the
latest data and projections provided by the most reputable organizations
and statistical offices in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they indicated that they used different methodology to produce
their live counters and their COVID statistics. I didn't find any live
counter for COVID data at Worldometers, but I don't know if they earlier
had similar live counters for COVID as the world population counter on
their front page where the numbers change every second. But in any case
the projected data would've probably been extrapolated from real data
like in the case of the other live counters.</p>
<p>And also I don't know if Worldometers was an important source of data
for the JHU dashboard, because on JHU's list of sources they only
include Worldometers under a section titled <span
class="quote">"Aggregated data sources"</span> but not under the sources
for any specific country or region:

<p>We next plot Covid death data (including <span

The smoothness of the curve is remarkable, and almost certainly reflects
the use of an SIRD epidemiological model as the underlying source of the
data. Naturally, since the JHU curve is identical in shape (only with
smaller numbers), it too reflects an SIRD model. Since we have already
established that a simple equation exists for <span

that models were used for all the data: confirmed, probable, and

<p>To drive this last point home, and for comparison purposes, we next
plot the graph of Covid deaths in Hubei province during the first three
months of 2020 (Figure 3 below). Despite the fact that the population of
Hubei province (58 million) is seven times that of NYC (8.3 million),
the number of deaths in Hubei (peak: 147, sum: 3,164) was significantly
less than in NYC (peak: 831, sum: 23,338 ). For these numbers to be
correct, it would mean that what happened in NYC was 51 times worse than
what happened in the province where Covid supposedly originated. That
scenario is so unlikely that it borders on preposterous, and lends
support to the notion that the NYC data was not based on observed
facts.</p>

<p>It is also observed that the graph for Hubei province (Fig. 3) is
more consistent with what empirical data typically looks like (jagged),
while the graph for NYC (Fig. 2) resembles what a computerised model
would produce (smooth).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However NYC had a much higher number of reported deaths than Hubei,
so there's of course less day-to-day noise because there's a bigger
sample size.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a similar population size as NYC, and it had about 170%
excess deaths in March 2022 according to OWID. At Worldometers the curve
for COVID deaths in February to April 2022 in Hong Kong looks smooth
like the curve for NYC, and it also has a similar shape where it goes
from zero to maximum and back to zero within a period of about two
months, and it takes about twice as long for the curve to fall back down
from the maximum as it takes to rise up to the maximum value:

<p>I used the Wayback Machine to look up the source of data that
Worldometers used for Hong Kong in March 2022.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20220331000040/https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news>http://web.archive.org/web/20220331000040/https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#news</a>]
On March 30th 2020 Worldometers added 135 new deaths for Hong Kong, and
the source was listed as this dashboard website which is not functional
at the Wayback Machine.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220330135151/https://chp-dashboard.geodata.gov.hk/covid-19/zh.html>https://web.archive.org/web/20220330135151/https://chp-dashboard.geodata.gov.hk/covid-19/zh.html</a>]
However I also found data for daily COVID deaths in CSV files published
by the Hong Kong government.
[<a href=https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/5th-wave-statistics.html>https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/5th-wave-statistics.html</a>]
In the CSV files the cumulative number of deaths was listed as 7,358 on
March 29th and 7,493 on March 30th, so 7,493 minus 7,358 is 135 which
matches the figure at Worldometers.</p>
<p>The CSV files only included data from March 5th onwards which was
near the peak in COVID deaths, so in the plot below I was not able to
include earlier data. The curve for COVID deaths in Hong Kong looks more
smooth than the curve for Hubei but slightly less smooth than the curve
for NYC, even though it might be because the peak number of daily COVID
deaths was over twice as high in NYC as Hong Kong, so NYC had less noise
because it had a bigger sample size for deaths even though NYC and Hong
Kong have a similar population size:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In February 2020 the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV-CSG), which is responsible for
developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming
(taxonomy) of the <em>Coronaviridae</em> family, assessed the novelty of
the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV (pre-print on biorxiv
<a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862v1.full>Gorbalenya
et al</a>, Perlman and Drosten are co-authors).</p>
<p>The virus was temporarily named 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV and
renamed SARS-CoV-2 based on the CSG's recommendations.</p>
<p>This is how they expressed the challenges in deciding novelty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <span class="quote">"novel"</span> may refer to the disease
(or spectrum of clinical manifestations) that is caused in humans
infected by this particular virus, which, however, is only emerging and
requires further studies. The term <span class="quote">"novel"</span> in
the name of 2019-nCoV may also refer to an incomplete match between the
genomes of this and other (previously known) coronaviruses, if the
latter was considered an appropriate criterion for defining <span
class="quote">"novelty"</span>. However, virologists agree that neither
the disease nor the host range can be used to reliably ascertain virus
novelty (or identity), since few genome changes may attenuate a deadly
virus or cause a host switch.</p>
<p>Likewise, we know that <strong>RNA viruses persist as a swarm of
co-evolving closely related entities</strong> (variants of a defined
sequence, haplotypes), known as quasi-species. Their genome sequence is
a consensus snapshot of a constantly evolving cooperative population
<em>in vivo</em> and may vary within a single infected person and over
time in an outbreak.</p>
<p>If the strict match criterion of novelty was to be applied to RNA
viruses, it would have qualified every virus with a sequenced genome as
a novel virus, which makes this criterion poorly informative. To get
around the potential problem, virologists instead may regard two viruses
with non-identical but similar genome sequences as variants of the same
virus; this immediately poses the question of how much difference is
large enough to recognize the candidate virus as novel or distinct? This
question is answered in best practice by evaluating the degree of
relatedness of the candidate virus to previously known viruses of the
same host or established monophyletic groups of viruses, often known as
genotypes or clades, which may or may not include viruses of different
hosts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, novelty depends on a genome sequence which is a mere snapshot of
a continually evolving dynamic swarm of co-evolving related entities,
and thus the decision of what constitutes novelty is complex, owing more
to judgement than objective analysis. It also depends on both the
disease or clinical manifestations and the completeness or
incompleteness of matches against other viruses. This presents a
veritable smorgasbord of confounding and confusion of cause with effect,
and in no way defines a <span class="quote">'thing'</span> in and of
itself.</p>
<p>If the strict match criterion of novelty was to be applied to RNA
viruses, it would have qualified every virus with a sequenced genome as
a novel virus. Therefore, they cannot be considered as isolated
singletons with absolutely unique attributes, but rather as mutually
overlapping families of individuals with shared attributes, making the
idea of novelty, in an absolute sense, completely redundant. Thus, the
ICTV apply a taxonomy to viruses that recognizes five hierarchically
arranged ranks: order, family, subfamily, genus, and species (in
ascending order of inter-virus similarity). Critics of this approach
argue that genetic diversity can only be reliably expressed,
<a href=https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.07173-11>mathematically</a>,
as pairwise distances between them and probabilities of overlap in
genetic divergence, or to put it another way there can be no taxonomy in
a swarm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However just because it's difficult to find a mammal which has an
identical genome to another mammal, it doesn't mean that there can be no
taxonomy of mammals. You can determine if a mammal is likely to be human
by checking if its whole genome sequence is around 99.5% or more similar
to the human reference genome (or a bit higher or lower depending on
whether you want to classify Neandersovans as humans).</p>
<p>The species name of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at GenBank is <span
class="quote">"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus"</span>. You can check if a virus is likely to belong to the
same species by checking if its genome is at least around 70-80% similar
to SARS-CoV-2 or SARS1, or if the genome is more similar to
sarbecoviruses than to other related species like hibecoviruses and
merbecoviruses.</p>
<p>If you have sequenced a sample of virions from a SARS-CoV-2
infection, it's difficult to measure how many mutations an average
virion has relative to a consensus sequence generated from all reads,
because the mutations are generally more rare than sequencing errors,
and if for example a genuine mutation only appears in a single read then
it can be impossible to tell it apart from a sequencing error. Sanger
sequencing has a low error rate, but the only Sanger sequencing runs of
SARS-CoV-2 I found at the SRA had less than 100,000 total bases of reads
(which might be enough to determine a likely consensus sequence, but
it's not nearly enough to find rare SNVs which only appear in a small
fraction of virions).
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=%22sanger+sequencing%22+sars-cov-2>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=%22sanger+sequencing%22+sars-cov-2</a>]</p>
<p>In order to determine which SNVs are likely to be real mutations and
not sequencing errors, one method is to pick a cutoff percentage which
is higher than the error rate of the sequencing method, and to then
filter out mutations whose frequency is below the percentage. But that
method ends up missing real mutations whose frequency is below the
cutoff percentage.</p>
<p>In one Brazilian study the authors sequenced complete or nearly
complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from 26 patients. When the authors
counted how many mutations appeared in at least 2% of reads within a
patient sample but not in the consensus sequence of the patient, it was
only about 0.77 mutations per 10,000 sites (so it would be about 2
mutations on average in the whole genome).
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7457605/figure/F3/>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7457605/figure/F3/</a>]</p>
<p>The distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its closest published
non-sarbecovirus neighbors is about 40%. So the number of nucleotide
changes per site is about 4e-1, which is almost 4 orders of magnitude
higher than the figure of 0.77e-4 mutations per site from the Brazilian
study. So basically the virions within a quasi-species swarm have so few
mutations that it's not possible to confuse them with a different
species of virus.</p>
<p>I'm using these reads of a culture derived from WA1 in the example
below, because they have high coverage depth so that most positions of
the genome are covered by over a thousand reads:
[<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR11607710>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR11607710</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-wa1-deep.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>The reads are derived from an isolate that was taken from the first
known COVID case in the United States, which was in Snohomish County in
Washington State. The consensus sequence of reads from the sample
differs from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome by 3 mutations, which are
all ancestral in the sense that they are shared with RaTG13 and BANAL-52
(C8782T, C18060T, T28144C).</p>
<p>This code downloads the reads, trims the reads to remove adapters and
low-quality bases from the ends of reads, aligns the reads against the
Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome, and makes a table of the frequency of each
allele at each position of the reference genome:</p>

2% or higher and that are at a position that is covered by at least a

standard mutations of WA1, which all have a frequency above 99.8%, so
they seem to exhibit little to no variation within the swarm. There's
only 2 mutations with a frequency over 10% but under 99%, which are
frequent enough that they are not likely to be solely due to basecalling
errors, so they might represent genuine mutations within the swarm:</p>

<p>The most frequent mutation on the list above is C23525T. It is even
found in three lineage A samples from Washington State with a collection
date in March 2020, which also have the WA1 mutation C18060T that is
missing from many other lineage A samples. So it suggests that the
patient of WA1 might possibly have infected other people in Washington
with virions that contained the mutation (or alternatively that the
mutation has just emerged many times independently, since it has later
also emerged in many lineage B strains):</p>

<p>But anyway, the point of this excercise was to demonstrate that
mutations in the swarm are so rare that typically a sample has less than
10 mutations with a frequency between 10% and 90%.</p>
<p>Neil and Engler wrote that <span class="quote">"there can be no
taxonomy in a swarm"</span>. But the average number of mutations between
the consensus of patient's swarm and individual virions in the swarm is
probably lower than the average number of mutations between different
circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the consensus sequence of
currently circulating strains. So does the existence of strains also
mean that there can be no taxonomy of viruses?</p>
<p>In another paper titled <span class="quote">"Spatio-temporal dynamics
of intra-host variability in SARS-CoV-2 genomes"</span>, the median
number of intra-patient SNVs was about 11 per sample: <span
class="quote">"We analysed 1347 transcriptomic samples obtained from
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by June 2020 from different populations
(Table 1). 1126 samples could be aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome. To ensure specificity of iSNV detection, the filtering criteria
and cutoffs used in the sequence reads were established by analysing an
additional set of 500 samples sequenced in replicates (Supplementary
Figure S1). 929 of the 1126 samples (82.5%) harboured one or more iSNVs
with frequencies ranging between 0.01 and 0.80 (Supplementary Dataset
S3a, b). In these 929 samples, we recorded a total of 47 779 iSNVs with
a median of 11 iSNVs per sample (Supplementary Figure S2A), revealing
extensive heteroplasmy in samples."</span>

I didn't find what cutoffs or filtering criteria the authors used, but
they presumably weren't able to detect iSNVs with a frequency well below
1%, because they sequenced the samples with Illumina NextSeq 550 which
had a fairly high error rate of about 0.6% in one study (which was
higher than 5 out of 7 Illumina platforms tested in the same study).
[<a href=https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/1/lqab019/6193612>https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/1/lqab019/6193612</a>]
However the authors wrote that their iSNVs had a frequency <span
class="quote">"between 0.01 and 0.80"</span>, so they may have ignored
iSNVs with a frequency below 1%.</p>
<p>In Supplementary Dataset 3a and 3b there's tables of allele
frequencies of various SRA runs grouped by country, where the minimum
frequency listed is also 0.01. I'm using the table for Germany as an
example because it's small enough to display as a single heatmap:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-quasi-1.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In this table of the German samples, the average number of mutations
per sample that had a frequency between 10% and 90% was about 1.5. The
average number of mutations per sample with a frequency between 1% and
90% was about 6.4:</p>
