<h2><a href=#Short_version name=Short_version>##</a> Short version</h2>
In March 2020 when the theory that SARS-CoV-2 does not exist had not yet attained widespread popularity, most of the biggest names in alt media who had started to promote the theory were flat earthers or people who have at some point said that they believe in flat earth, including Allegedly Dave, Amandha Vollmer, Andrew Kaufman, Barnabas Nagy, Crrow777, David Weiss, James True, Jason Lindgren, Jeran Campanella, Karen B, Max Igan, Owen Benjamin, Paul on the Plane, Richie from Boston, RussianVids, Sofia Smallstorm, Steve Falconer, The Daily Plane, and Tom Barnett.

The first video on Andrew Kaufman's YouTube channel is an interview he did with the flat earther James True in November 2019, which was Kaufman's debut interview according to the description of the video. I believe the next three people in alt media who interviewed Kaufman were the flat earthers Crrow777, Secrets of Saturn, and Richie from Boston.

James True said on Twitter that he was Kaufman's <span class=quote>&quot;lead writer&quot;</span>. Kaufman's first presentation that went viral was livestreamed by James True in March 2020, and it featured a discussion about Kaufman's presentation by a panel of six flat earthers. A Powerpoint file for the presentation was hosted on James True's website, which might indicate that True wrote the slides, because he also hosted Powerpoint files of his own videos on his website.

In April 2020, James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;My Dr. Kaufman vid has been seen over 200k times in 5 days. I am employing myself, one editor, and one producer and we could use a video editor for maximum effect.&quot;</span> He also tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;I have emptied my patreon account on editors, publishing, and pushing Dr Kaufman's video.&quot;</span> True also said that Kaufman's video was <span class=quote>&quot;the most important work I have ever done&quot;</span>, and he said that an article on his website consisted of Kaufman's words but that <span class=quote>&quot;we sat down and wrote them up together&quot;</span>.

James True may have also written the script for Kaufman's film Hippocratic Hypocrisy, because the film featured an extended discussion about the occult meaning of the Staff of Asclepius and the Caduceus of Hermes, which was the theme of one of James True's YouTube videos. The Hippocratic Hypocrisy film was made by the flat earth channel Spacebusters and narrated by Steve Falconer from Spacebusters, but the only way in which the film featured Kaufman was that it featured clips of Kaufman's interview with Max Igan. Steve Falconer has also done English voiceovers for Stefan Lanka's videos, and he narrated a 3-part video version of Mark Bailey's essay <span class=quote>&quot;A Farewell to Virology&quot;</span>. The flat earther Jason Lindgren narrated a film that starred Andrew Kaufman called <span class=quote>&quot;Terrain: The Film&quot;</span>. In early March 2020, Falconer posted a video about the no-virus theory which has over a million views on BitChute, which was probably the earliest viral video about the theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not exist. By late 2023, Kaufman himself had started to say that the earth is flat.

On Max Igan's BitChute channel, the earliest video about the no-virus theory I found was a video by the flat earther Tom Barnett that Igan mirrored in March 2020. In January 2020, Max Igan posted a video where he said that the earth is flat, and a day later he posted a video where he said that the earth is simultaneously both flat and not flat, but then a few days later he said that the earth is not actually flat and that he had some kind of a mental breakdown because he was targeted with a mind control beam. However in 2016 Max Igan had already fabricated evidence to prop up the flat earth theory, because he did a video where he said that in order to debunk the flat earth theory, he took a compass with him on a flight from Chile to Australia, but he claimed that unexpectedly the compass ended up pointing in a direction which was consistent with a flat earth model, and his video was then used as proof that the earth is flat by Globebusters and Jeranism. In 2018 Max Igan was one of the people who popularized the fake conspiracy theories about Tartaria and mud floods, which are closely linked to flat earth. The trend of making videos about mud floods was started by a Russian flat earther called Philipp Druzhinin, who Igan promoted in his early videos about Tartaria.

James True said that he first met Andrew Kaufman in 2019 on a retreat of the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies. In 2020 True attended another retreat at the Omega Institute where he met with the flat earthers Amandha Vollmer and Benjamin Balderson, who both call themselves alchemists, and who both say that viruses are not real. Andrew Kaufman offers courses about spagyric alchemy on his website, Kelly Brogan offers a 40-day course in alchemy which costs 22,000 USD, and Barrie Lando from Alfa Vedic says that he has an alchemical laboratory. Tom Cowan sells his own brand of spagyric ant tincture for 6,500 USD per liter, which he says was developed by a master alchemist and is made of mountain ants that have a high paramagnetic level.

James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;Masons believe lying is good for the people. They seek to bring an age of enlightenment. They lie to bring Lucifer.&quot;</span> James True also advocated for lying in several other tweets, and for example he tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;If no one lied, no one would discern. Lies open our discernment. Parents lie to their child to open their discernment.&quot;</span> He also tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;Lies are the greenhouse of discernment. Why do you think God allows all these drip emitters? Embrace the rain. Every stalk is a fantasy percolated by your belief.&quot;</span> And he tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;My book Best apocalypse Ever explains what this place is... a Freemason greenhouse for discernment. We are God's organic witness crop and freemasonry knows how to sharpen our stone. It only feels like victimhood because victimhood serves us. We use it as a salve to vent.&quot;</span> James True's tweets are full of Masonic concepts like the Great Work or the Phoenix rising from the ashes, like for example: <span class=quote>&quot;Awareness is the understanding that we are all illuminating ourselves. Just like when we chose long ago to enslave ourselves. The Great Work is rapture. A baptism through psychology. Phoenix fire.&quot;</span> He also tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;Satan is the fall of man. Lucifer is the rise. King James didn't want people to rise. The Golden Dawn is why we are all here. It is the goal of the Great Work... <span class=quote>'A world of Philosopher Kings where sovereignty is known in the heart instead of on paper.'</span>&quot;</span>

James True posted a video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Are you a Traveling Man&quot;</span>, where he seemed to admit that he was a Mason without saying it directly, or if he's not a Mason then he pretended to be a thinly veiled Mason. In 2020, James True interviewed Marty Leeds about Freemasonry. Both of them had detailed knowledge about Masonry, and they defended Freemasonry throughout the interview and they didn't seem to have anything negative to say about Masonry. But still both of them claimed that they were not Masons, and Leeds said that he had learned about Masonry by reading books and by talking with Masons, even though he even uses the username martyleeds33 on various websites.

Marty Leeds was one of the speakers at the Flatoberfest 2022 event, where the other speakers included two of the six flat earthers who were featured in James True's livestream of Kaufman's presentation in March 2020. The main organizer of the event is Karen B, but in March 2020 when the no-virus theory had not yet become popular, she said: <span class=quote>&quot;Viruses don't make people sick. They're not contagious. There's no <span class=quote>'global'</span> pandemic because there is no globe.&quot;</span> The Flatoberfest event is organized annually at the Greenville Shrine Club &amp; Event Center. The website of the event center says that <span class=quote>&quot;Shriners are members of the Masonic Fraternity and adhere to the principles of Freemasonry&quot;</span>. The page for Flatoberfest 2022 at Facebook says that the event was held by United For Good Information, which is Crrow777's organization. Crrow777 said on his podcast that he has <span class=quote>&quot;talked to so many people that I was in the Marine Corps with that were Masons&quot;</span> <span class=paren>(just like how Bill Cooper claimed that he was not a Mason himself but he just knew a lot about Masonry because he had talked with a lot of Masons while he served in the Navy)</span>. Crrow777 is ex-marine and James True is ex-military like Alec Zeck. Crrow777's name might come from Aleister Crowley's Kabbalistic text titled <span class=quote>&quot;777&quot;</span>.

The website of Alec Zeck's <span class=quote>&quot;End of COVID&quot;</span> event said that the event had five directors, but two of them were the flat earthers Amandha Vollmer and Kelly Brogan, and a third one was Dawn Lester, who I believe did her first two interviews in alt media with the flat earthers Greg Carlwood and Crrow777. Many of the earliest reviews of Lester's book at Amazon were written by listeners of Crrow777. Amandha Vollmer was one of the speakers in EVENT 202, which was an online conference about COVID that was organized by the flat earther Dave Murphy and that featured a flat earth in its logo. Another speaker at EVENT 202 was the ex-military flat earther Shelley Lewis, who made a film about flat earth together with the ex-military flat earther Joshua Michael Gennari.

In March 2020 David Weiss and Sofia Smallstorm appeared together on the flat earth podcast jeranismRAW, where they said that viruses are detergents that are produced by the human body. In 2006 Smallstorm published a 9/11 documentary under her real name Sofia Shafquat, but she was sued by Rick Siegel because she used his footage of the twin towers without permission, and she falsified the footage by adding the sound of explosives to support her theory of a controlled demolition, but after the court ruled in Siegel's favor, she disappeared from the conspiracy scene for a while, until she later reemerged with the name Monica Smallstorm which she next changed to Sofia Smallstorm. After David Weiss's old website had become inactive, it used to be redirected to Ole Dammegård's website, but in March 2020 Dammegård published a blog post about Andrew Kaufman's theory, even though at that point I believe Kaufman hadn't appeared anywhere in alt media outside of flat earth channels. In one episode of the Stew Peters Show, the first guest was the <span class=quote>&quot;former Special Operations psyop officer&quot;</span> Emily Grace Rainey, and the second guest was David Weiss who presented his sales pitch about flat earth. David Weiss's cohost for his podcast used to be Tim Rothschild, who calls himself a Kabbalist healer, and who says that he was educated at a <span class=quote>&quot;mystery school&quot;</span> from 2013 to 2017. David Weiss also collaborated with the Sandy Hook hoaxer Dr. Eowyn, whose bio said that she is <span class=quote>&quot;a lecturer for the U. S. Department of Defense's Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, as well as the U. S. Marine Corps War College&quot;</span>. Weiss and Smallstorm used to be prominent Sandy Hook hoaxers before they became flat earthers, but the Sandy Hook hoaxer Caliberhitter had also become an early flat earther by April 2015.

In an interview with Alec Zeck in 2023, David Martin said that viruses are not real, that DNA is not real, and that atoms are not real. Some of his first appearances in alt media were on Sacha Stone's channel and on Sacha Stone's fake international tribunal called ITNJ. David Martin's COVID dossier was supported by a fundraising effort of Sacha Stone's New Earth technology team. Sacha Stone was one of the first big names in alt media who started to promote the no-virus theory in the spring of 2020. In 2021 Robert David Steele and Sacha Stone organized the Arise USA Tour, whose slogan was <span class=quote>&quot;CONSTITUTIONAL COUNTIES, FAITH, FAMILY, &amp; FREEDOM&quot;</span>, where the initial letters correspond to 33 and 666. Robert David Steele published an article about information channeled from extraterrestrials by Polish people, which that <span class=quote>&quot;According to the Taygeteans, there is no virus and never was one. The current pandemic is a HOAX.&quot;</span> The emblem of RDS's Earth Intelligence Network features a red Templar cross in the middle, which is similar to the red Templar cross that is featured in the emblems of Nordic rites of Freemasonry. In early 2020, RDS frequently promoted an article by Douglas Gabriel from American Intelligence Media, who said that COVID was caused by nanoparticles that were activated by 5G. Douglas Gabriel is one of the leading anthroposophists in the United States, and he has said that he worked for the NSA and that he has been a Freemason and a Jesuit priest, and that he was tasked by the Society of Jesus to infiltrate anthroposophy. Sacha Stone is friends with Ciro Orsini, who is a member of one of the thirteen papal bloodline families.

Before Judy Mikovits and David Martin became the stars of the Plandemic films, they were featured as the stars of ITNJ's Corona Emergency Hearing sessions. Mikki Willis used to be the videographer of the communist Jew Bernie Sanders, and Mikki's twin sons both have Hebrew first names. Robert David Steele said that the main focus of his Open Source Everything Engineering initiative was to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. An old bio of David Martin said that he has served as an advisor to allied intelligence agencies. When people were saying that the logo of David Martin's company M-CAM looks like a Masonic compass placed in front of a Masonic apron, Martin denied that his logo had Masonic influences, but he said that his grandfather and great-grandfather were both Masons, and that <span class=quote>&quot;My great grandfather had numerous connections to the Masonic influence in Washington DC including having a rather interesting involvement with the construction of the Washington monument.&quot;</span> David Martin's great-grandfather was also the chairman of the committee which selected the flag of Washington DC. David Martin has an eye of Horus tattoo on his shoulder, the default thumbnail for articles on his website contains an eye of Horus, and in one of his headshot photos he is wearing a bowtie which contains an eye of Horus pattern.

I believe the first 4 people in alt media who interviewed Andrew Kaufman were all flat earthers. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-03-30+andrew+kaufman&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-03-30+andrew+kaufman&amp;f=live</a>]</span> The first video on Kaufman's YouTube channel is an interview he did in November 2019 with the flat earther James True. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x526Y0_NV6I>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x526Y0_NV6I</a>]</span> In the description of the video, Kaufman says that it was his debut interview, but he did not yet discuss virology in the interview. On March 13th 2020 UTC, the flat earther Crrow777 tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;We have recorded a Dr Kaufman follow up and hope to get it by tonight.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/crrow777/status/1238498607394889730>https://x.com/crrow777/status/1238498607394889730</a>]</span> References to Kaufman on Twitter became more frequent after his interview with the flat earther Richie from Boston on March 21st 2020. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until:2020-03-21+%22andrew+kaufman%22&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until:2020-03-21+%22andrew+kaufman%22&amp;f=live</a>]</span> On March 22nd and 25th, the flat earther Secrets of Saturn <span class=paren>(Jason Lindgren)</span> interviewed Kaufman. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22secrets+of+saturn%22+%22andrew+kaufman%22>https://www.google.com/search?q=%22secrets+of+saturn%22+%22andrew+kaufman%22</a>]</span>

On March 24th UTC, James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;I'll be live streaming in about an hour with Dr. Andrew Kaufman, Duke certified doctor. We'll be discussing germ theory as propaganda, and weaponized hypoxia.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1242544979538579459>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1242544979538579459</a>]</span> At the end of the video, Kaufman told True that <span class=quote>&quot;you and I were together, you know, my first time speaking in public about this kind of material, so you know, thanks for helping me out with that&quot;</span>, and next Kaufman plugged two livestreams he was going to do the next day with Richie from Boston and Secrets of Saturn. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCZkJLc6ho?t=1h53m59s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCZkJLc6ho?t=1h53m59s</a>]</span>

Out of the videos on Kaufman's YouTube channel that are currently visible, the first 5 videos are about general health-related topics like nutrition or blood pressure <span class=paren>(even though Kaufman is supposed to be a psychiatrist)</span>. The first video where Kaufman presented his theory about virology is the 6th video, which was posted on April 1st 2020 UTC and titled <span class=quote>&quot;SPECIAL REPORT: Humanity is NOT a virus!&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGd7-vvd9Y&amp;t=0m58s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGd7-vvd9Y&amp;t=0m58s</a>]</span> The video consists of the segment for Kaufman's presentation from James True's livestream on March 30th UTC. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200401101334/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78>http://web.archive.org/web/20200401101334/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/aNslmdO3UecE>https://www.bitchute.com/video/aNslmdO3UecE</a>]</span>

At the beginning of the video, Kaufman said: <span class=quote>&quot;I just want to thank some people out there who have been really instrumental and inspiring to me. So, first of all, Dr. Cowan who has been outspoken as well on this issue, and he really inspired me and gave me some great ideas that helped me put this whole big picture together. I want to especially thank James True who has been a great friend, confidant, and collaborator throughout this whole thing, and we're definitely going to do a lot more work together down the road. I really want to thank Richie from Boston, Jason Lindgren, and Crow777 for giving me the opportunity to get my message out there and for being so supportive and open. It's really just been incredible that I've been able to pursue this mission. I want to thank my kids who have been ignored a lot lately, since I've been working so hard trying to figure things out, and I'm so proud of them, they're the only children in my area who I know who are not afraid of getting sick, and they're out playing and having a good time. And then lastly Dr. Lanka and Dr. Turner Banks who have done just amazing research and scholarship, and have written books and papers that have really helped me figure things out. So thank you to everyone.&quot;</span> So Kaufman gave thanks to three people for getting his message out, who were all flat earthers who interviewed him in March 2020.

Kaufman said that James True had been <span class=quote>&quot;a great friend, confidant, and collaborator throughout this whole thing&quot;</span>. On April 1st 2020 UTC True said about Kaufman: <span class=quote>&quot;I met him last Summer in Rhinebeck. He's one of the best people I know. Proud to call him a friend.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244786635658723328>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244786635658723328</a>]</span> On April 4th UTC True said about Kaufman: <span class=quote>&quot;His friendship means a lot to me. We met in Rhinebeck.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1246290082610524160>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1246290082610524160</a>]</span> I tried searching Google and Twitter for <span class=code>`"andrew kaufman" "rhinebeck"`</span> and <span class=code>`"andrew kaufman" "omega institute"`</span>, but I didn't find more information about Kaufman's connection to the Omega Institute at Rhinebeck.

In July 2020, James True posted several videos from a retreat of the Omega Institute at Rhinebeck. One video was titled <span class=quote>&quot;Rheinbeck - A Roundtable on Demons&quot;</span> and its description said: <span class=quote>&quot;I asked my friends in Rheinbeck about their views on demons and the technology of belief. Counterclockwise from me are Lane LeShock, Amandha Vollmer, Beth Martens, Aaron Earl, L Auren Bright, Jonathan Rogers, Jenn Mazgelis, Aaron Beattie, and Benjamin Balderson.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFRE3-X404A>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFRE3-X404A</a>]</span> Another video was titled <span class=quote>&quot;Rheinbeck - Man is salt. Woman is oil.&quot;</span>, and its description said: <span class=quote>&quot;A conversation on alchemy with Benjamin Balderson and Amandha Vollmer. Man is the salt. Woman is the oil. Put them together and you have alchemy.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2KiFKpumKA>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2KiFKpumKA</a>]</span> Vollmer and Balderson are both flat earthers who say that viruses are not real. In August 2020, James True posted a podcast whose description said that it was his <span class=quote>&quot;weekly livestream with fellow Rheinbeck alum Amandha Vollmer from YumNaturals Emporium&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/james-true-live/117-amandha-vollmer-and-oUg4kl-LAPc/>https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/james-true-live/117-amandha-vollmer-and-oUg4kl-LAPc/</a>]</span> In September 2019 James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;Back from New York at Rhinebeck in the Catskills. Many fires. Many blessings. My heart is still there.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1174701488507162624>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1174701488507162624</a>]</span> There was a deleted reply to his tweet to which he replied: <span class=quote>&quot;First time.&quot;</span> So I don't know if it meant that he attended Rhinebeck for the first time in the summer 2019, which is when he also met Kaufman. I don't know if True, Vollmer, and Balderson already knew each other before summer 2020 which is why they went to Rhinebeck at the same time. At least True knew Balderson, because Balderson was one of the six members of Kaufman's panel in March 2020, and True and Balderson also appeared together on the Inside the Matrix podcast in March 2020. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244347002982408194>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244347002982408194</a>]</span>

On March 28th 2020 UTC, James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;Dr Andrew Kaufman is a Duke-trained medical doctor. I am his lead writer. You need to STFU with your dogma. No one is giving you virtue anymore for spouting CDC song lyrics.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1243876724066136065>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1243876724066136065</a>]</span> So did True mean that he writes Kaufman's articles or that he writes the scripts of Kaufman's presentations? If True was Kaufman's <span class=quote>&quot;lead writer&quot;</span>, then did Kaufman also have other writers? In the description of True's livestream for Kaufman's presentation, there's links to websites which were used as sources in the presentation and a link to a Powerpoint file of the presentation hosted on True's website jtrue.com. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78</a>]</span> However in the shorter clip of the livestream which was posted on Kaufman's channel, the links to the sources or the Powerpoint presentation are not included. When I searched DuckDuckGo for <span class=code>`site:jtrue.com pptx`</span>, I found that True also hosted PowerPoint presentations of his own YouTube videos on his website.

On April 4th 2020 UTC, James True tweeted a link to a page on his website for sending him donations, and he wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;My Dr. Kaufman vid has been seen over 200k times in 5 days. I am employing myself, one editor, and one producer and we could use a video editor for maximum effect. If you like what I am doing and want to feed the war chest I could use the fuel.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1246504730282598402>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1246504730282598402</a>]</span> On April 10th UTC, James True tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;I have emptied my patreon account on editors, publishing, and pushing Dr Kaufman's video.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1248607417744666630>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1248607417744666630</a>]</span>

So when Kaufman said that True was his <span class=quote>&quot;confidant and collaborator&quot;</span>, did he mean that True was responsible for writing, editing, producing, publishing, and advertising Kaufman's content <span class=paren>(and even hiring other people to help him do it)</span>?

On March 30th UTC before James True livestreamed Kaufman's presentation on YouTube, he tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;In 7 minutes, I am dropping a video exposing Covid-19 as a fear virus. I am encouraging and begging anyone to download it and re-upload to their channel. I have made the raw files available on my website. This is the most important work I have ever done. <a href=https://jtrue.com/av/&quot>https://jtrue.com/av/&quot</a>;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244751246231248897>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244751246231248897</a>]</span> A day later when someone sent this reply to a tweet by James True about Kaufman's presentation: <span class=quote>&quot;I rarely rt stuff I haven't read or watched. This had better be worthwhile.&quot;</span> Then James True replied: <span class=quote>&quot;Hold me accountable if it's not. This video is the most important work I have ever done! <a href=https://youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot>https://youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot</a>;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244771210027769864>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1244771210027769864</a>]</span> So because James True called the video his work, and he even said that he was accountable for the content of the presentation, it seems to further indicate that James True wrote the Powerpoint slides of Kaufman's presentation.

On April 6th 2020 UTC, David Icke did an interview with London Real which got around 10 million views on YouTube before it was deleted. David Icke had earlier said that 5G causes COVID, but around the time he did the interview with London Real, he also started to say that SARS-CoV-2 is not real and viruses are exosomes. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-04-06+david+icke+covid&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-04-06+david+icke+covid&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://www.integralworld.net/visser166.html>https://www.integralworld.net/visser166.html</a>]</span> At the beginning of the interview, Icke said: <span class=quote>&quot;Since we last spoke, Bryan, I've spent every waking moment - which has been most of every 24 hours - devouring information from virologists, specialists, doctors - all around the world, in America, Germany, in Austria, Italy - who would never be allowed to get near the BBC or CNN.

<h2><a href=#Kaufman_s_panelists_and_Flatoberfest name=Kaufman_s_panelists_and_Flatoberfest>##</a> Kaufman's panelists and Flatoberfest</h2>
In James True's livestream on March 30th 2020, Kaufman's presentation was followed by a discussion of the presentation by six panelists, who were Benjamin Balderson <span class=paren>(which I think is not his real name because he is a Norse pagan and Balder is a Norse god)</span>, Richard Comito Jr. <span class=paren>(Richie from Boston)</span>, Jason Lindgren <span class=paren>(Secrets of Saturn)</span>, Steve Mercer <span class=paren>(Freeman Fly)</span>, Lindsey Scharmyn <span class=paren>(Rogue Ways)</span>, and James True. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRbIIaPV78</a>]</span> I think all six are flat earthers, except for possibly Freeman Fly who might be agnostic about flat earth.

The first interview on Lindsey Scharmyn's Rogue Ways channel was with Crrow777, the second with Max Igan, the 3rd with Freeman Fly, the 4th with Sofia Smallstorm, the 8th with James True, and the 24th with Tom Cowan. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/@RogueWays/videos>https://www.youtube.com/@RogueWays/videos</a>]</span> In an interview with David Weiss, Scharmyn agreed with him that the earth was flat, and she said: <span class=quote>&quot;You thought that you would never be someone who would even consider flat earth, but when you look into it, you're like, I can't deny this now.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmOE37x66NU&amp;t=58m44s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmOE37x66NU&amp;t=58m44s</a>]</span>

In an interview with that Freeman Fly did with the flat earthers Karen B, Jason Lindgren, and James True, he said: <span class=quote>&quot;<span class=paren>(21:26)</span> I was thinking about - you know what, we need to describe this flat plane, like what it would be like. So I don't know that everyone has that knowledge of, you know, ice walls, oceans, and how this all actually looks, what is it if it's not a globe. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(43:00)</span> So let's talk a little - as we're working towards the end of this hour - a little bit about what changes in humanity as they start to realize a life-changing scenarios, such as the earth is flat, not round, that you have been lied to your entire existence. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(1:01:28)</span> When you start to discover things like flat earth, and take that to another level of dismantling your reality, and realize what you really do know - what you really can prove - and life becomes way more amazing.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROGYrBhFiE8>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROGYrBhFiE8</a>]</span> However in a livestream in 2022 when Benjamin Balderson was asked if Freeman Fly was a flat earther, Balderson answered: <span class=quote>&quot;He is - he is, kind of - he is, kind of not like fully into it, fully onboard, but he's kind of, and he's obviously not objecting to it.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoFiwuSAB4&amp;t=28m40s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoFiwuSAB4&amp;t=28m40s</a>]</span> When I checked the list of Freeman Fly's newest interviews, the 3rd newest interview was with Jason Lindgren, the 4th with Crrow777, the 17th with James True, the 46th with Sofia Smallstorm, the 125th with Max Igan, the 284th with Andrew Kaufman, and the 416th with David Weiss. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://freemantv.com/>https://freemantv.com/</a>]</span>

Freeman Fly lives in Greenville, which is also where Karen B has held the flat earth conference Flatoberfest annually since 2019. Freeman Fly said that Flatoberfest 2020 was <span class=quote>&quot;set up at the Shriner's Center - yes, at the heart of Freemasonry. I didn't even know we had a Shriner's Center in Greenville.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROGYrBhFiE8&amp;t=58m12s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROGYrBhFiE8&amp;t=58m12s</a>]</span> Flatoberfest 2022 was also held at the <span class=quote>&quot;Greenville Shrine Club &amp; Event Center&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://flatearthfestivals.com/2022strengthenedplan/>https://flatearthfestivals.com/2022strengthenedplan/</a>]</span>

Benjamin Balderson presented his alchemical theory of flat earth at Flatoberfest 2022. He said: <span class=quote>&quot;I'm calling it the biochemical electromagnetic flat earth - not exactly a catchy name. But - I - so here's a fairly basic representation of what we're looking at with it. Now when you're looking at it here, we live basically where this line is in the center. Underneath it there's going to be a fairly similar bubble to up top. That's where - when I'm talking, I don't necessarily call it a flat earth, but we live on a fairly flat plane, the plane of manifestation. <span class=paren>[...]</span> So we live on this plane of manifestation - so where many of us recognize the dome above, there's also the same basic shape underneath, as you see with the toroid, and when you're living on the plane of inversion instead of a plane of manifestation - which is what I would call it from an alchemist point of view - that it's going to be the same basic shape.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRE9_AV5RHg&amp;t=2m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRE9_AV5RHg&amp;t=2m54s</a>]</span> In July 2020 James True did a livestream about Hermetic principles with Balderson and Kaufman. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.jtrue.com/podcast/112-hermetics-with-balderson-and-kaufman>https://www.jtrue.com/podcast/112-hermetics-with-balderson-and-kaufman</a>]</span> In 2020 James True posted two videos from a retreat of the Omega Institute where he discussed demonology and alchemy together with Balderson and Amandha Vollmer. Vollmer's job title at LinkedIn is listed as <span class=quote>&quot;Alchemist&quot;</span>, and her bio at Twitter says that she is <span class=quote>&quot;an Alchemist of Life&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/greatcentralsun>https://x.com/greatcentralsun</a>]</span> Balderson's podcast is called <span class=quote>&quot;Odin's Alchemy&quot;</span>, and his guests have included Amandha Vollmer, Jason Lingren, Freeman Fly, David Weiss, Marty Leeds, Karen B, and Owen Benjamin. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://rokfin.com/stream/11069/Ep-10--Odins-Alchemy-with-Amandha-Vollmer>https://rokfin.com/stream/11069/Ep-10--Odins-Alchemy-with-Amandha-Vollmer</a>]</span> Balderson's podcast also has an episode about how germ theory is false. Another one of his guests was Auto Didactic, whose YouTube channel has videos about topics like Tartaria, mud floods, and star forts, but who also has a few videos about flat earth. <span class=paren>(Channels that follow the formula where they post videos about Tartaria and mud floods often have a few videos about flat earth, and similarly channels that are primarily focused on flat earth often have a few videos about Tartaria or mud floods.)</span>

In a YouTube stream that Karen B did together with the flat earther Brian Staveley on March 28th 2020 in an unknown timezone, she said: <span class=quote>&quot;Viruses don't make people sick.

<h2><a href=#Crrow777 name=Crrow777>##</a> Crrow777</h2>
After James True, I think Crrow777 was the second person in alt media who interviewed Kaufman. His name might come from how 777 is a significant number in Thelema. Aleister Crowley wrote a text titled <span class=quote>_777_</span>, which has been published as part of the book <span class=quote>_777 And Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley: Including Gematria &amp; Sepher Sephiroth_</span>. The book was edited by the Jew Israel Regardie. The description of the book at Amazon says: <span class=quote>&quot;<span class=quote>_777_</span> itself contains, in concise tabulated form, an overview of the symbolism of the major world religions, as well as the system of correspondence of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In short, it is a complete magical and philosophical dictionary - a key to all religion and practical occultism - an amazing work whose value has been recognized through many editions since its first appearance in 1909 and subsequent enlargement in 1955.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Other-Qabalistic-Writings-Aleister-Crowley/dp/0877286701>https://www.amazon.com/Other-Qabalistic-Writings-Aleister-Crowley/dp/0877286701</a>]</span>

In one episode of his podcast, Crrow777 said that he has <span class=quote>&quot;talked to so many people that I was in the Marine Corps with that were Masons&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.crrow777radio.com/wayne-mcroy-playlist-free/>https://www.crrow777radio.com/wayne-mcroy-playlist-free/</a>, episode 425, time 28:35]</span> <span class=paren>(Bill Cooper also claimed that he he was not a Mason but he learned about Masonry by talking to people at the Navy who were Masons, and Cooper said that other officers who served at his level in naval intelligence were all either Masons or Mormons, and he said that he was accidentally given a top secret QSI clearance at naval intelligence because in a form where he had to select which secret societies he belonged to, he circled the Freemasons because he had been a member of the Masonic youth society DeMolay as a teenager, but DeMolay was not featured as an option on the form. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUgs4vwW4AY&amp;t=15m34s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUgs4vwW4AY&amp;t=15m34s</a>]</span>)</span>

True also advocates for lying:

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;We have an aversion to the negative polarity that's so strong we miss how lies can be used to raise healthy and awakened children.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/jarue369/status/1251573550168891398>https://x.com/jarue369/status/1251573550168891398</a>]</span></span>

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;There is no commandment in the Bible telling you not to lie. If you think lying is immoral, you are making your own morality. Welcome to the luciferian.

True wrote about the Great Work in these tweets:

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;People aren't ugly. They're afraid to be beautiful. You get to show them how selfish it is to hide their beauty from the world. This is the Great Work.

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;The Great Awakening happens inside the illuminati too. Inside the darkest hearts. Awareness is the understanding that we are all illuminating ourselves.

True also mentioned the Golden Dawn in several tweets:

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;Aquarius is not a war. No. Its so much better. Its a hunt and we are its painted warriors. We hunt the metallic panther that takes our children at night.

<span class=list>- <span class=quote>&quot;King James invented the idea Lucifer was evil. He did this while he turned his eyes on every witch he could find and tortured them under his supervision.

<h2><a href=#James_True_and_Marty_Leeds_on_Freemasonry name=James_True_and_Marty_Leeds_on_Freemasonry>##</a> James True and Marty Leeds on Freemasonry</h2>
Marty Leeds was one of the speakers at Flatoberfest 2022, which was held at the Shrine Club &amp; Event Center in Greenville, South Carolina. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://flatearthfestivals.com/2022strengthenedplan/>https://flatearthfestivals.com/2022strengthenedplan/</a>]</span> The website of the event center says that <span class=quote>&quot;Shriners are members of the Masonic Fraternity and adhere to the principles of Freemasonry&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://greenvilleshrineeventcenter.com/>https://greenvilleshrineeventcenter.com/</a>]</span>

In 2020, James True interviewed Marty Leeds about Freemasonry. Both of them had detailed knowledge about Masonry, and they defended Freemasonry throughout the interview and they didn't seem to have anything negative to say about Freemasonry. But still both of them claimed that they were not Masons, and Leeds said that he had learned about Masonry by reading books and by talking with Masons. At one point in the interview, Leeds said: <span class=quote>&quot;When we first went into Masonry, we were like, what is going on here? Is it - are these - is this like devil worship or something like that? What's going on? It's serious inquisitive - you know questions about. Like, I'm gonna go in, and I'ma look. And if I find the devil I'm gonna be pointing at the devil all day long.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7rWNpp7k&amp;t=59m19s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7rWNpp7k&amp;t=59m19s</a>]</span> But I guess by <span class=quote>&quot;going into Masonry&quot;</span>, he meant reading books about Masons.

On the SecretoMasonico forum, Leeds wrote that <span class=quote>&quot;I was not and am not a Freemason, a member of any sort of underground or secret society&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.gabitos.com/SecretoMasonico/template.php?nm=1488035294>https://www.gabitos.com/SecretoMasonico/template.php?nm=1488035294</a>]</span> But can we trust his word in the case that he actually is a Mason? James True said that Masons believe that lying is good.

The username of Marty Leeds on Twitter is martyleeds33, and his website martyleeds33.com gets redirected to his website gnosticacademy.com.

Marty Leeds has done interviews with a lot of no-virus people like Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.altcensored.com/channel/UCjcYXazpAS5g9uUEeQMAC4Q>https://www.altcensored.com/channel/UCjcYXazpAS5g9uUEeQMAC4Q</a>]</span> Most videos on Leeds's YouTube channel have been deleted or hidden, but his channel used to include videos about flat earth.

Marty Leeds was featured as a guest on the 33rd episode of the comedian Sam Tripoli's Tin Foil Hat podcast. Tripoli has also done interviews with Andrew Kaufman, Benjamin Balderson, Crrow777, David Weiss, Jason Lindgren, Lindsey Scharmyn, Max Igan, and Sofia Smallstorm. David Weiss's DITRH podcast is recorded at the studio of a stand up comedy club.

During the interview with Marty Leeds, James True said that Masons have to employ deceit in order to get people to experience their own Prometheus moment: <span class=quote>&quot;And someone like Albert Pike would say, <span class=quote>'No, I can't be your liberator. You have to liberate yourself. And the only way that I can liberate you is by actually using deceit and mystery to spur you to find your own truth.'</span> In fact, that's why he speaks that the certain blue people in the lodge - the blue labels basically are lied to - again, it's - hear me out - it's no different than a karate instructor doing a foot swipe and knocking you on your ass. It's - he's going to keep doing that because that's what's necessary for you to progress to the next level. If he was not to do that, you would just turn around and either praise him or accuse him of being either the savior or the enslaver of you. So Freemasonry has to use - the people inside who use these rituals have to use what we call deceit as a way of spurring our own Prometheus moment. It's no different than the mom pushing the baby out of the nest.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7rWNpp7k&amp;t=52m48s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7rWNpp7k&amp;t=52m48s</a>]</span>

In 2022, James True posted a video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Are you a Traveling Man&quot;</span>, where he basically admitted that he was a mason without saying it directly, or if he's not a Mason, then he pretended to be a thinly veiled Mason. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrqF2NJviu0&amp;t=2m26s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrqF2NJviu0&amp;t=2m26s</a>]</span>

<h2><a href=#Spacebusters_and_Hippocratic_Hypocrisy name=Spacebusters_and_Hippocratic_Hypocrisy>##</a> Spacebusters and Hippocratic Hypocrisy</h2>
On March 4th 2020, the flat earth channel Spacebusters posted a video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Important Information on Coronavirus 5G Kung Flu&quot;</span>, which I believe was the earliest viral video about the theory that SARS-CoV-2 is not real. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/mWcUoESRO0c5/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/mWcUoESRO0c5/</a>]</span> The video included a long segment of a radio show from 2009 where Aajonus Vonderplanitz talked about how viruses are <span class=quote>&quot;solvents&quot;</span> or <span class=quote>&quot;soaps&quot;</span> or <span class=quote>&quot;enzymes to fractionate tissue for waste elimination&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://whale.to/a/aajonus-interview-apr-2009.pdf>http://whale.to/a/aajonus-interview-apr-2009.pdf</a>]</span> Vonderplanitz also said that polio is caused by a detoxification of the spinal cord which occurs approximately once every 28 years, or approximately once every 248 years in a severe form, and that <span class=quote>&quot;it usually takes many many generations before the spinal chord will get that toxic to where a whole race will have to go through a heavy detoxification at the same time&quot;</span>.

In June 2020, Spacebusters released a film called <span class=quote>&quot;Hippocratic Hypocrisy&quot;</span> which presented Kaufman's views on virology. The start of the film says that the film was made <span class=quote>&quot;by Dr. Andrew Kaufman &amp; Spacebusters&quot;</span>, and the credits of the film say that the film was written by Kaufman and Steven S. Busters, that it was produced by Spacebusters, and that its technical advisor was Rosco S. Busters. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/hippo/>https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/hippo/</a>]</span> Steven S. Busters is the pseudonym of Steve Falconer who narrated the film.

The only footage of Kaufman included in the film were clips of an interview he did with Max Igan. In a YouTube video in March 2020, Max Igan said that Steve from Spacebusters was his friend: <span class=quote>&quot;It was actually a good report put out by a friend of mine, who's I believe in Denmark at the moment, called Steve Falconer. He's got a YouTube channel or a BitChute channel called Spacebusters.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j670kqChxDQ&amp;t=9m56s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j670kqChxDQ&amp;t=9m56s</a>]</span> Max Igan started promoting the no-virus theory in March 2020 when he mirrored a video by Tom Barnett on YouTube and BitChute, but Barnett also says that the earth is flat.

The theme of the Hippocratic Hypocrisy film was how medicine has been infiltrated by the <span class=quote>&quot;second snake&quot;</span>, and the logo of the film featured a rod with two snakes called the Caduceus. The film features an extended discussion about the occult meaning of the Staff of Asclepius and the Caduceus of Hermes: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://truthcomestolight.com/hippocratic-hypocrisy/>https://truthcomestolight.com/hippocratic-hypocrisy/</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; The Rod of Asclepius has been the exoteric symbol for medical healing since as far back as 1400 to 1200 BC.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; He was the son of Apollo, the god of healing, immortalized forever in the stars as Ophiuchus, the serpent holder standing on the male genital phallus and corpuscle destroyer, Scorpio, which we'll cover in the plot twist at the end of this film.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; It is the staff with the single snake, completely misunderstood exotericly, to be a symbol of the snakes possession of anti-venom against its own poisons and its ability to shed its skin and renew - an exoteric symbol of longevity and immortality.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; But in 1902 a captain in the US Army Medical Corps mistook the caduceus for the Rod of Asclepius and he proposed the adoption of the caduceus as the Medical Corps official symbol.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; The two-snake caduceus is the symbol of the Roman god Mercury, whereas the one-snake rod is the symbol of Asclepius.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Before 1902, the caduceus was used as a symbol for commerce and companies in printing, as Mercury or Hermes was the messenger of the gods.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; It was used in mining, chemistry and metallurgy, as alchemy was a hermetic science.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Exotericly Mercury is the god of commerce, trade, merchants, outlaws, thieves and tricksters and is represented by two serpents to show the opposing meanings of polarization.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; One snake is the healing - remediating and curative - the upward flow of living corpuscles from the spleen to the cerebral crown chakra, supporting positive energy, inner development and enlightenment.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; The other serpent is the poisonous, debilitating, drainage of the living corpuscles away from the higher-self, body and mind.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; It is this second serpent that has infiltrated medicine.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; It has convinced us that paying for poison is the cure for cellular poisoning.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>[...]</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; In esoteric biblical biochemistry, the healing Rod of Asclepius is the staff of Moses.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; The electrical seed germination that creates the healing corpuscles of the cells <span class=paren>(created in our spleen)</span> that make up our blood, lymph and nerve endings, brought down to the spleen from the cerebrum <span class=paren>(or Aries the lamb or Ram of God)</span>, also known as Brahma or Abraham, by Mercury, the messenger of the Godhead.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; That is why Moses, or the electric seed of the corpuscles, is the descendant of Abraham, our cerebrum.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; The winged caduceus of Mercury is the Tree of Life.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; While the serpents represent the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or cellular ease and dis-ease, one is the sensory system, the other the motor system, doing work pertaining to motion. But perverted it becomes e-motion, meaning energy wasted, substance lost, death and dis-ease.</span>

I don't know if James True wrote the script for the film, because in 2021 he did a livestream titled <span class=quote>&quot;#256 - The Second Snake&quot;</span> which focused on the relationship between the Rod of Asclepius and the Caduceus of Hermes. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PatnEAqFQk>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PatnEAqFQk</a>]</span> Or maybe the film had multiple writers, because True said that he was Kaufman's <span class=quote>&quot;lead writer&quot;</span>, which may have meant that Kaufman had a team of multiple writers.

One of the videos on Kaufman's YouTube channel is a trailer for Hippocratic Hypocrisy. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJp3qLPkmVI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJp3qLPkmVI</a>]</span> The description of the video is only a few lines long, but it still includes links to websites about the <span class=quote>&quot;esoteric meaning of Mercury, Hermes and the Caduceus <span class=paren>(Gemini)</span>&quot;</span> and the <span class=quote>&quot;esoteric meaning of the Rod of Moses, staff of Asclepius <span class=paren>(Scorpio)</span>&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://truthserumnews.com/2018/01/31/gemini-the-esoteric-analysis-and-synthesis-of-potassium-chloride-kali-mur/>https://truthserumnews.com/2018/01/31/gemini-the-esoteric-analysis-and-synthesis-of-potassium-chloride-kali-mur/</a>, <a href=https://truthserumnews.com/2018/02/01/scorpio-the-influence-of-sun-on-vibration-of-blood-at-birth-and-the-analysis-of-synthesis-of-calcium-sulph/>https://truthserumnews.com/2018/02/01/scorpio-the-influence-of-sun-on-vibration-of-blood-at-birth-and-the-analysis-of-synthesis-of-calcium-sulph/</a>]</span>

In 2022 Marcelina Cravat and Andrew Kaufman released a film called <span class=quote>&quot;Terrain: The Film&quot;</span>, which was narrated by Cravat and Jason Lindgren <span class=paren>(Secrets of Saturn)</span>. How come all the no-virus films are narrated by flat earthers?

In 2019 Falconer posted a video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Oslo Tech pt 2: Reset evidence Goddess Fall Tartarian Free Energy&quot;</span>, whose description says: <span class=quote>&quot;A photo tour of Oslo Norway looking into mud liquefaction event reset evidence, the fall of the lunar and stellar goddess cult and rise of the solar cult and the possibility of free Tesla atmospheric energy devices used there in the Victorian age.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa94KIEdBug>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa94KIEdBug</a>]</span> At time 9:55, Falconer first showed photos of lamps in a park at Oslo, and then he showed a photo of a spire on the roof of a church next to the park, and he said: <span class=quote>&quot;At the base of the park sits a church with this strange copper device on top, and all of the buildings around are always the same. Giant space-age antenna made of metal or copper sitting on an octagon geometric base, with some kind of ball on top. You see them in every city around the world. The churches and street lamps always have the same as the buildings - space-age antenna with a ball on top, often with an octagon geometry. Was this some kind of atmospheric plasmic wireless energy system in these cities, not so long ago? You have to wonder if Tesla invented this stuff or just rediscovered it.&quot;</span> The same claim that the spires on top of churches are antennas for transmitting free energy has been repeated by dozens of flat earth YouTubers. JonLevi says that the spires on top of church roofs are <span class=quote>&quot;AntiquiTech&quot;</span> devices. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivixH0eEZZQ&amp;t=57s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivixH0eEZZQ&amp;t=57s</a>]</span>

<h2><a href=#Max_Igan_mud_floods_and_Tartaria name=Max_Igan_mud_floods_and_Tartaria>##</a> Max Igan, mud floods, and Tartaria</h2>
In 2016, Max Igan posted a video where he said that in order to disprove the flat earth theory, he took a compass with him on a flight from Chile to Australia, but then according to the flat earther Jeranism who discussed Igan's video, <span class=quote>&quot;Every time he checked his compass he was getting a southwest reading, which a flat earth would show. And on the on-screen video display on the back of the seat in front of him was showing northwest as a globe would show. He had been asleep for 5 hours, he said, but when he woke up, the plane was showing the portion of the trip as northwest, but his compass was showing a different reading of southwest.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://odysee.com/@jeranism/max-igan%27s-santiago-to-sydney-flight?t=320>https://odysee.com/@jeranism/max-igan%27s-santiago-to-sydney-flight?t=320</a>]</span> So did Max Igan make a fake video to prop up the flat earth theory even though he himself pretended to not be a flat earther? Later in 2017 Jeranism also did a 6-hour livestream where he tracked Max Igan's flight the other way from Sydney to Santiago. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.flatearthscience.org/live-flight-tracking-max-igan-qantas-sydney-to-santiago/>https://www.flatearthscience.org/live-flight-tracking-max-igan-qantas-sydney-to-santiago/</a>]</span> Igan's compass experiment was also used as evidence that the earth is flat by Globebusters.

In January 2020, Max Igan posted a YouTube video where he said that the earth is flat, and in the same video he also said that his real name is not Max Igan and he had a swastika drawn on his palm <span class=paren>(or maybe it was a tattoo which he hasn't shown in other videos)</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/afugFIfsRQR8/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/afugFIfsRQR8/</a>]</span> The next day he posted another video where he said that the earth is both flat and not flat, but it just depends on your vibe, folks: <span class=quote>&quot;The earth is a globe, yes, the earth is flat, yes, and they can both coexist at the same time. <span class=paren>[...]</span> The truth is the earth is flat. And the truth is the earth is globe. It's just depending on your belief, folks, because both are absolutely true.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/64tpPF2xaTo/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/64tpPF2xaTo/</a>, 5:52]</span> However a few days later, he said that he was being targeted with mind control technology and that he doesn't actually believe in flat earth: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Um4uSmTaIY&amp;t=7s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Um4uSmTaIY&amp;t=7s</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; I had some weird stuff happened in the last couple of weeks. I got targeted, folks. I had some sort of a weird thing happen, and I got targeted. I guess I was making too much of a difference with my fire videos, and so they hit me with something. I was lying in bed, and they hit me with something, and they filled my head full of all this rubbish. And I haven't really known what's been going on for the last couple of weeks. It's been crazy, it's been really crazy. And I have no reference point with how to deal with this. You know, I tried to post some stuff online to show you what was happening to me, and what I was going through. I thought it was important for people to see. I've actually received a lot of messages from people who have gone through similar things as well, a lot of people who know I'm not crazy. But the point being folks, they hit me with something. I just underwent a coordinated attack. They hit me with some sort of a light. Had I been asleep when that hit me, I would have literally woke up in the morning thinking I'd had an epiphany, that I was the second coming, and the earth was flat. And that's kind of what I was feeling anyway, and I had this overwhelming impulse that I had to post this online. It was crazy. But all the way through it, I'm thinking, but this is technology, this was technology, you know. My fortunate part about it - like you know, what I find to be fortunate is - I was awake when I saw this coming and hit me. But we all hear about these things, we hear about these directed beams, and we hear about mind control, all sorts of stuff. But we never really think it's going to happen to us. Well that's just what happened to me folks. And it's literally taken me two weeks to work through this. But I'm fine, I'm gonna be back, I'm gonna be doing more fire videos. I don't think the earth is flat.</span>

In August 2018 Max Igan posted a video where talked about mud floods, he promoted the mud flood and flat earth YouTuber Philipp Druzhinin, and he said that <span class=quote>&quot;the model that we are presented with for the earth being the globe that we're told it is is completely wrong&quot;</span>: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/rSo22py0aRSN/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/rSo22py0aRSN/</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>(15:25)</span> The concept of them hiding history, and the concept that the history we've got now being patently false, and really only sort of started two-three hundred years ago really becomes a distinct possibility when you start looking at the evidence. The reason I've been talking quite a bit about the mud flood that I became aware of when I was in Europe - when I was in Harlem, in Holland - when I saw a couple of those buildings that had these extra structures below the foundations. And then when I searched and I found that there were a lot of people exposing this on YouTube as well - and particularly one Russian guy - if you want to find out about the mud floods, you'll find a channel by a man called Philipp Druzhinin - I think is the name of the channel - I'll put a below in the description of the YouTube version of this. I actually may contact him, and we may have a chat with him, possibly even have him on the show - just simply haven't had enough time. But quite an interesting character. And he's put a lot of research into finding where this mud flood exists across Europe, and you'll get a great deal of information from his channel. I think he may be a flat earther, so don't hold that against him. You'll still find a lot of good information regarding this mud flood on his channel.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>[...]</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>(17:35)</span> You know, this is what the flat earthers believed. They have so much ammunition, because the model that we are presented with for the earth being the globe that we're told it is is completely wrong. I'm not saying the earth is flat, because I've done experiments myself which show curvature to be there. But even with that, none of the models we are given are correct. The globe model that we're given is in no way correct. I myself have had compass anomalies when I've flown on flights - only 10 degrees out or something - but still 10 degrees out is 10 degrees out. Of course it does depend on where you sit on the plane, the metal of the plane affects the compass, blah blah blah. Even metal in ships affects compasses, so it's a kind of an unreliable experiment. But still things are not what we're told. But an interesting thing you know, if you look at a map of the earth, it simply doesn't add up to be what we're told it is. When you really look at it, there is every indication that they are hiding land, and there's somewhere else that exists on this earth that we simply don't know about, because we have not been told that it's there.</span>

Later in 2018, Max Igan began to post several videos about mud floods and Tartaria. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%28max+igan+tartaria+until%3A2019-1-1%29+OR+%28max+igan+mud+flood+until%3A2019-1-1%29&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%28max+igan+tartaria+until%3A2019-1-1%29+OR+%28max+igan+mud+flood+until%3A2019-1-1%29&amp;f=live</a>]</span> Around the same time, the subjects of mud floods and Tartaria began to be promoted by a huge number of flat earthers, and many flat earth YouTubers even switched the main focus of their channel to Tartaria or mud floods, including Flat Earth British, Barnabas Nagy, captain kirk, Richard Lopez, and UAP. The YouTuber <span class=quote>&quot;Static in the attic&quot;</span> who has made several videos about mud floods said that <span class=quote>&quot;the mud flood subject really got coined by Philipp Druzhinin&quot;</span>, but Druzhinin is a flat earther. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0RtVIks700&amp;t=11m44s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0RtVIks700&amp;t=11m44s</a>]</span> Druzhinin started posting videos about mud floods in 2016, but I didn't find any other YouTube channel with videos about mud floods before December 2017.

Someone who investigated the origins of the mud flood phenomenon wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;I did find a YouTube user, Philipp Druzhinin, who had been posting videos about a mud flood since August of 2016. At first there wasn't much interest in his videos; they had very low viewership. That is, until December 2018/January 2019 - the same time that Google Trends reported the Internet became aware of the subject. Druzhinin had an enormous spike in his downloads right at that time.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4765>https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4765</a>]</span>

I don't know why YouTubers ended up connecting mud floods to Anatoly Fomenko's theory of the Tartarian Empire, because I didn't find a single reference to mud floods in Fomenko's books or on his website. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=site:chronologia.org+mud>https://www.google.com/search?q=site:chronologia.org+mud</a>]</span> The YouTubers who make videos about Tartaria often also cover topics like star forts, free energy, giants, <span class=quote>&quot;AntiquiTech devices&quot;</span>, or a global reset in the 1800s, none of which are discussed in Anatoly Fomenko's books as far as I can tell. Or the YouTubers look at photos of architecture from the 1800s or even 1900s and claim that it's Tartarian, even though Fomenko says that the Tartarian Empire collapsed after Pugachev's Rebellion in 1773-1775. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html>https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html</a>]</span> <span class=paren>(It could be that aspects of Fomenko's theory are real, so maybe disinformation agents on YouTube were tasked with creating a more ridiculous version of his theory in order to discredit Fomenko, even though I believe that Fomenko's purpose might also have been to discredit the true aspects of his theory by causing them to be associated with the false aspects of his theory. For example I think Fomenko presented convincing evidence that books by Tacitus that were supposedly discovered during the Renaissance were actually forgeries written during the Renaissance. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://chronologia.org/en/seven/1N07-EN-373-409.pdf>https://chronologia.org/en/seven/1N07-EN-373-409.pdf</a>]</span> But then that gets discredited because it gets lumped together with Fomenko's easily disprovable claims, like that the dendrochronological record doesn't go back further than the 10th century.)</span>

But anyway, below are the oldest videos about mud floods I found on various YouTube channels. Almost all of the channels also have videos about Tartaria, and around half of the channels also have videos about flat earth:

But anyway, I think there is a network of disinformation agents which was employed to popularize the flat earth psyop in 2015, and it was later employed to popularize the conspiracy theories about Tartaria and mud floods in 2018, and next in 2020 members of the same network were given the script to promote the theory that viruses are not real. The flat earth, Tartaria, and no-virus theories had all existed in some form before they were picked up by the network, but the network helped to popularize them among the masses on YouTube. And I think the same network also includes people like Max Igan and Sofia Smallstorm, who are not generally known as flat earthers but who are still linked to the flat earth network, or who have only occasionally said that they believe in flat earth or who pretend to be agnostic about flat earth.

<h2><a href=#Sofia_Smallstorm_and_Jim_Fetzer name=Sofia_Smallstorm_and_Jim_Fetzer>##</a> Sofia Smallstorm and Jim Fetzer</h2>
Sofia Smallstorm is another early no-virusnik who is linked to flat earth. In 2015 when the flat earth psyop was first popularized, Smallstorm did an episode about flat earth on her podcast, and she has since then done interviews with several flat earthers, including DITRH <span class=paren>(David Weiss)</span>, Flat Earth Podcast, Jeranism <span class=paren>(Jeran Campanella)</span>, Sague of Quay <span class=paren>(Mike Williams)</span>, and The Daily Plane. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=sofia+smallstorm+flat+earth&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=sofia+smallstorm+flat+earth&amp;f=live</a>]</span>

In an interview with the flat earth channel jeranismRAW in 2018, Smallstorm said that she is agnostic about flat earth but that some aspects of the flat earth model are plausible: <span class=quote>&quot;I think it's very plausible that the toroidal thing of the different - the different worlds - lands, as David and I call them - beyond the Antarctic ice wall, and their own suns and moons, which supposedly are what we call our planets. But this star thing has to be wrapped above and around all of that. It's not just a flat layer. So whether the earth is flat or not, I can't tell you, but it is definitely some kind of interior - central interior to many layers which I would call dimensions.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjCWADmMJJc&amp;t=38m37s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjCWADmMJJc&amp;t=38m37s</a>]</span> By David, she probably meant David Weiss, who said he was first turned into a flat earther in 2015 by Smallstorm.

On March 23rd 2020 local time, Sofia Smallstorm appeared as a guest on an episode of the jeranismRAW podcast, where the other two guests were David Weiss and Jason Lindgren. Smallstorm talked about how viruses are excreted by the body to clean out cellular debris, and she talked about Arthur Firstenberg's book <span class=quote>_The Invisible Rainbow_</span> and about how flu is not a viral disease. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstuEFrcjTI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstuEFrcjTI</a>]</span> In May 2020, Kaufman posted an interview with Smallstorm on his YouTube channel. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200626144429/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUtPjSfPo-g>http://web.archive.org/web/20200626144429/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUtPjSfPo-g</a>]</span>

Around May 2020, Smallstorm did interviews about germ theory with the controlled opposition outlets SGT Report and Israeli News Live. <span class=paren>(Israeli News Live consists of Steve Ben-Nun and his wife Jana. Steve has said that he is a former CIA agent. In early 2020, he started saying that the debris field surrounding Planet X would begin to impact the Earth in late 2020 or early 2021, and that most humans on Earth would die soon afterwards. In 2020, he also spoke in several conferences about Planet X together with his friend John Moore, who says that he is a former intelligence analyst for the US government. In the 2017 Flat Earth International Conference in San Diego, Steve and Jana hosted a debate about flat earth between their friend Stephen Pidgeon and the flat earther Zen Garcia, during which Zen Garcia said that <span class=quote>&quot;the gospel was written and delivered to the apostles and the prophets by the Designer - the Grand Architect&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pWU2PsmQbU&amp;t=51m30s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pWU2PsmQbU&amp;t=51m30s</a>]</span>)</span>

In 2006, Sofia Smallstorm released a 9/11 documentary called <span class=quote>_911 Mysteries Part 1: Demolitions_</span> under her real name Sofia Shafquat, but she was sued by Rick Siegel because she used his 9/11 footage without permission, and she falsified the footage by adding the sound of explosives to support her theory of a controlled demolition, and she edited together footage of the North Tower and South Tower and misrepresented it as footage of the South Tower. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20070225192729/www.911researchers.com/node/114>http://web.archive.org/web/20070225192729/www.911researchers.com/node/114</a>]</span> Then after the court ruled in Siegel's favor, Smallstorm disappeared from the conspiracy scene for a while, but she later re-emerged under the name Monica Smallstorm which she next changed to Sofia Smallstorm.

Smallstorm's profile on the website of <span class=quote>&quot;Women Writers Initiative Pakistan&quot;</span> said that she was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and the description of her novel from 1993 says that she is a cousin of Salman Rushdie. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://i.ibb.co/xhp9JFy/sofia4.jpg>https://i.ibb.co/xhp9JFy/sofia4.jpg</a>, <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Man-Novel-Sofia-Shafquat-ebook/dp/B01BM0H0EA>https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Man-Novel-Sofia-Shafquat-ebook/dp/B01BM0H0EA</a>]</span> However she doesn't look Pakistani, so she might be an ethnic Jew who was born in Pakistan or something, because Salman Rushdie has been suspected of being a crypto-Jew. Smallstorm is not even a native speaker of English, because she has said that she spoke English with a heavy accent when she moved to America around the age of 18 or 20 <span class=paren>(I don't remember the exact age)</span>. In an interview in 2007, Smallstorm mentioned that she moved around a lot as a child, and when she was asked if it was because she came from a military family, she answered that <span class=quote>&quot;we're going to move on now&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Hufschmid-14Sept2008.html>http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Hufschmid-14Sept2008.html</a>]</span>

In her documentary <span class=quote>&quot;Unraveling Sandy Hook&quot;</span>, Sofia Smallstorm promoted the same kind of easily debunkable disinformation as Jim Fetzer. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.spingola.com/Unraveling1.html>https://www.spingola.com/Unraveling1.html</a>, <a href=http://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2015/11/ten-reasons-jim-fetzers-sandy-hook-book.html>http://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2015/11/ten-reasons-jim-fetzers-sandy-hook-book.html</a>]</span> For example her documentary featured a video clip where she claimed that people were walking multiple times in circles around the Sandy Hook school which meant that the people were crisis actors, but the video just consisted of a clip of people walking around the school once which was looped multiple times. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://odysee.com/@bitjesus/Sofia-Smallstorm-Unraveling-Sandy-Hook?t=3252>https://odysee.com/@bitjesus/Sofia-Smallstorm-Unraveling-Sandy-Hook?t=3252</a>]</span>

In July 2020, Fetzer did an interview with Smallstorm where she said that viruses are exosomes. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/5ECQnAs64rnP/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/5ECQnAs64rnP/</a>]</span> Next in August 2020, Fetzer mirrored videos about the no-virus theory by Max Igan and Sofia Smallstorm on his BitChute channel. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/1OcKZxuTvY5u/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/1OcKZxuTvY5u/</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/fLYP1dus3DJV/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/fLYP1dus3DJV/</a>]</span> Afterwards Fetzer has also mirrored videos by people like Tom Cowan, Andrew Kaufman, and Amandha Vollmer. So Fetzer and Smallstorm have promoted the same type of disinformation first about 9/11, then Sandy Hook, and then COVID.

In 2021 Jim Fetzer published a long article about a video where Stew Peters interviewed Carrie Madej about hydras, and Fetzer described a supposed laboratory analysis of the hydras by Franc Zalewski. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://jameshfetzer.org/2021/10/parasitic-organism-dubbed-the-thing-found-in-covid-vaccines-dr-franc-zalewski-thats-why-theres-graphene-added-inside-the-vaccines-which-nourishes-the/>https://jameshfetzer.org/2021/10/parasitic-organism-dubbed-the-thing-found-in-covid-vaccines-dr-franc-zalewski-thats-why-theres-graphene-added-inside-the-vaccines-which-nourishes-the/</a>]</span>

Fetzer and Smallstorm both claimed that the Sandy Hook school had been closed for several years before the shooting. One of their arguments was that there were no new snapshots of the school's website at the Wayback Machine between 2008 and 2013, but that's because the lines <span class=code>`User-agent: *`</span> and <span class=code>`Disallow: /`</span> were added to the <span class=code>`robots.txt`</span> file in 2008. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-full-proof-sandy-hook-was-closed-5-yrs-ago.3236/>https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-full-proof-sandy-hook-was-closed-5-yrs-ago.3236/</a>, <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604014943/http://www.newtown.k12.ct.us/robots.txt>https://web.archive.org/web/20080604014943/http://www.newtown.k12.ct.us/robots.txt</a>]</span> C. W. Wade has posted links to PTA meeting minutes of the Sandy Hook school, a school handbook for the 2010-2011 school year, an enrollment report from 2012, a 2012-2013 school calendar, a budget approved by the board of education approved for 2012-2013, and so on. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2014/07/sandy-hook-hoax-claims-debunked.html>http://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2014/07/sandy-hook-hoax-claims-debunked.html</a>]</span> There's also old tweets which refer to various activities at the school in the year 2012 and earlier. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=sandy+hook+elementary+until%3A2012-12-13&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=sandy+hook+elementary+until%3A2012-12-13&amp;f=live</a>]</span>

Fetzer claims that the planes that hit the twin towers were holograms. As evidence he keeps showing a screenshot of an old military website which has a page about an <span class=quote>&quot;Airborne Holographic Projector&quot;</span> which <span class=quote>&quot;can be used for psychological operations and strategic perception management&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://odysee.com/@BrianRuhe/911-Who-was-Responsible-and-Why---Jim-Fetzer,-Ph.D?t=4662>https://odysee.com/@BrianRuhe/911-Who-was-Responsible-and-Why---Jim-Fetzer,-Ph.D?t=4662</a>, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20010621172648/maxwell.af.mil/au/2025/volume4/chap03/b5_6.htm>http://web.archive.org/web/20010621172648/maxwell.af.mil/au/2025/volume4/chap03/b5_6.htm</a>]</span> However the website was part of a program called <span class=quote>&quot;Air Force 2025&quot;</span>, where students and faculty members of the Air University at the Maxwell Air Force Base were asked to imagine what technologies would be used by the Air Force in the year 2025. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20010602050617/http://www.maxwell.af.mil/au/2025/>http://web.archive.org/web/20010602050617/http://www.maxwell.af.mil/au/2025/</a>]</span> Fetzer says that the screenshot is from an <span class=quote>&quot;Australian military manual&quot;</span> because the URL of the website features the directory name <span class=code>`/au/`</span>, but actually the AU stands for Air University.

Joel from Aryan Empires has shown that the Sandy Hook hoaxers like Fetzer and Smallstorm were collaborating with the anti-hoaxers, where one side manufactured false conspiracy theories that were easily debunked by the other side, and where both sides ignored the genuine anomalies which have been found by researchers like Joel and JFK371, and both sides were full of people who were linked to law enforcement or the military, or who were felons or on probation, or who were linked to the controlled opposition outlet American Free Press. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://aryanempires.blogspot.com/search/label/Jim+Fetzer>http://aryanempires.blogspot.com/search/label/Jim+Fetzer</a>, <a href=http://aryanempires.blogspot.com/2020/07/sandy-hook-covenant-live-chat-guest-jfk.html>http://aryanempires.blogspot.com/2020/07/sandy-hook-covenant-live-chat-guest-jfk.html</a>]</span>

In addition to Smallstorm and Weiss, Caliberhitter is another Sandy Hook hoaxer who became an early flat earther, because he was already saying that the earth was flat by April 2015. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://serendipitous.boards.net/thread/75/caliberhitter-flat-earther>https://serendipitous.boards.net/thread/75/caliberhitter-flat-earther</a>]</span> In 2012 Caliberhitter also originated the ridiculous theory that the conspiracy host Mark Dice was the dead actor River Phoenix, but flat earthers later started promoting several similar theories that some person was actually some other dead person. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://caliberhitting.com/mark-dice-river-phoenix-2022-update-anyone-says-otherwise-looking-evidence-idiot/>https://caliberhitting.com/mark-dice-river-phoenix-2022-update-anyone-says-otherwise-looking-evidence-idiot/</a>, <a href=https://fitzinfo.net/2014/11/26/is-alex-jones-behind-the-conspiracy-theory-that-he-is-bill-hicks/>https://fitzinfo.net/2014/11/26/is-alex-jones-behind-the-conspiracy-theory-that-he-is-bill-hicks/</a>]</span>

<h2><a href=#David_Weiss_and_Timothy_Rothschild name=David_Weiss_and_Timothy_Rothschild>##</a> David Weiss and Timothy Rothschild</h2>
David Weiss is also known as DITRH, Flat Earth Dave, and Rabbit Hole Dave. In 2015 he debated Jim Fetzer on whether the earth is flat or not <span class=paren>(which was likely a case of a staged fight where both sides were recruited from the same pool of dishonest actors, just like later debates against flat earthers by Max Igan and Jason Goodman)</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIuLU8asI-8>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIuLU8asI-8</a>]</span> In 2014 before Weiss had become a flat earther, Jim Fetzer interviewed Weiss and Nathan Folks about the Boston marathon bombing. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://radiofetzer.blogspot.com/2014/10/nathan-folks-david-weiss.html>http://radiofetzer.blogspot.com/2014/10/nathan-folks-david-weiss.html</a>]</span> At the time Nathan Folks worked as a producer and talent manager at Hollywood. He first questioned the official story about the Boston bombing in a radio interview he did with Voice of Russia, and Dr. Eowyn wrote an article based on the interview. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20140504050624/fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/05/01/hollywood-producer-nathan-folks-says-boston-bombings-a-false-flag/>http://web.archive.org/web/20140504050624/fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/05/01/hollywood-producer-nathan-folks-says-boston-bombings-a-false-flag/</a>]</span>

In 2014, the National Geographic published a documentary called <span class=quote>_Inside the Hunt for the Boston Bombers_</span>, where the cast of actors included someone named David Weiss who played the role of Jeffrey S. Salley. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.avclub.com/film/reviews/inside-the-hunt-for-the-boston-bombers-2014>https://www.avclub.com/film/reviews/inside-the-hunt-for-the-boston-bombers-2014</a>]</span> At IMDB, the actor in the movie doesn't have the same profile page as the flat earther David Weiss, but if they're actually the same person then I guess David Weiss is yet another flat earther who has also worked as an actor. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3660486/fullcredits>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3660486/fullcredits</a>]</span>

In 2015, David Weiss and Peekay Truth were interviewed about the Boston bombing by John B.

An article from 2017 said: <span class=quote>&quot;Actor Peter Kusznir has been reported of <span class=quote>'repeatedly impersonated and vilified the friends'</span> of 10-yr-old Thalia Hakin who was killed in Melbourne's Bourke St tragedy in which a driver ploughed allegedly intentionally into pedestrians.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.jwire.com.au/jccv-appalled-about-actors-vilification-of-the-family-and-friends-of-thalia-hakin/>https://www.jwire.com.au/jccv-appalled-about-actors-vilification-of-the-family-and-friends-of-thalia-hakin/</a>]</span> Peekay is also a Sandy Hook hoaxer, and C. W. Wade wrote that Peekay <span class=quote>&quot;stalked and harassed victims of the Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook, and the Nice truck attack&quot;</span> <span class=paren>(so he may have been tasked with harrassing the Sandy Hook families in order to make conspiracy theorists look bad)</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2017/02/restraining-order-issued-to-hoaxer.html>https://www.sandyhookfacts.com/2017/02/restraining-order-issued-to-hoaxer.html</a>]</span> In 2016, David Weiss said that Peekay <span class=quote>&quot;has stayed on the sidelines from the flat earth - Peter. Well, neutral - I think he's leaning over the flat side, but he doesn't want to jump over the fence yet because he's afraid.&quot;</span> To which Peekay answered: <span class=quote>&quot;I'm just gonna get out of the closet here. Look, yeah, look, you want me to say my opinion on the flat earth. Look, I'll just put it this way, simply.

In 2014, Fetzer also did a second podcast where he interviewed David Weiss, but this time Weiss was accompanied by Timothy Rothschild, who used to be the co-host of Weiss's DITRH podcast. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://radiofetzer.blogspot.com/2014/02/>http://radiofetzer.blogspot.com/2014/02/</a>]</span> I found an article which said that it was Rothschild's idea to start the podcast, and that Weiss was first turned into a flat earther by Sofia Smallstorm: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://theunexpectedcosmology.com/globe-proof-deep-inside-the-rabbit-hole-with-david-weiss-and-the-flat-earth-awakening/amp/>https://theunexpectedcosmology.com/globe-proof-deep-inside-the-rabbit-hole-with-david-weiss-and-the-flat-earth-awakening/amp/</a>, <a href=https://theunexpectedcosmology.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/the-unexpected-cosmology-pdf.pdf>https://theunexpectedcosmology.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/the-unexpected-cosmology-pdf.pdf</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; Weiss and Timothy Rothschild met while working together at a company, the name of which, Weiss insists, is not necessary to the narrative. It was during lunch hour that their career in conspiracy theory, or what Weiss refers to as <span class=quote>&quot;truth seeking,&quot;</span> unofficially began. Here Weiss recalls, <span class=quote>&quot;We'd be talking about the Federal Reserve and how it's not real money, and it's a private bank, and nobody believed us.&quot;</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>[...]</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Initially, DeepInside the RabbitHole was Rothschild's idea. <span class=quote>&quot;Tim had a good friend who offered the opportunity for us to do a show with him. Stand Up NY Labs was a podcast studio in New York City, and they were looking for something conspiracy minded.&quot;</span></span>

<span class=quote>&gt; In the third year Weiss began receiving messages from flat earthists. <span class=quote>&quot;I started banning people from our social media for repeatedly saying such stupid things. And I wouldn't even look into it, and then one day I was speaking with Sofia Smallstorm, who made one of the first 9/11 movies, called <span class=quote>_911 Mysteries_</span>, and we became friends, and we were talking about how there were a whole bunch of hoaxes and events that were happening.&quot;</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Weiss said: <span class=quote>&quot;It's amazing how much deception there is in the world,&quot;</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; And then Smallstorm said: <span class=quote>&quot;Oh David, it's worse than that.&quot;</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=quote>_I think the earth could be flat._</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=quote>&quot;I was bowled over,&quot;</span> Weiss recalled. This - coming from a fellow researcher whom he had so much respect for. <span class=quote>&quot;I had just spent twenty minutes banning a bunch of people from social media.&quot;</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=quote>_What do you mean the earth is flat?_</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Smallstorm sent him an assortment of video links, and one of them was Mark Sargent. After stumbling upon Eric Dubay's <span class=quote>_200 Proofs that the Earth Is Flat_</span>, Weiss had had enough.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=quote>_That's it. I'm going to debunk this._</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=quote>&quot;And for the next two weeks I researched every hour of every day that I had available to disprove - just come up with one proof that the earth is a ball. That's all you need, just one.&quot;</span> Weiss paused over the phone. <span class=quote>&quot;And I couldn't do it.&quot;</span></span>

It's interesting that the podcast was recorded at the studio of a stand up comedy club. Eddie Bravo started talking about flat earth on Joe Rogan's podcast around August 2015, which probably introduced a lot of new people to flat earth. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=eddie+bravo+flat+earth+until%3A2016-01-01&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=eddie+bravo+flat+earth+until%3A2016-01-01&amp;f=live</a>]</span>

David Weiss used to have a Facebook page called <span class=quote>&quot;Exposing The Big Three&quot;</span> which was about 9/11, Sandy Hook, and the Boston Bombing. In 2014, <span class=quote>_Veterans Today_</span> published an article by Dr. Eowyn which said that Wolfgang Halbig lectured to a room of nearly 200 Oath Keepers about Sandy Hook, and he managed to convert many of them into hoaxers. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20150919001439/http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/05/01/cia-spy-confirms-sandy-hook-and-boston-bombing-false-flags/>http://web.archive.org/web/20150919001439/http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/05/01/cia-spy-confirms-sandy-hook-and-boston-bombing-false-flags/</a>]</span> The article included a photo where Halbig posed together with David Weiss and Tim Rothschild who both accompanied him to the event. Dr. Eowyn's article was based on notes about the event that were written by Weiss, and the article mentioned that <span class=quote>&quot;I <span class=paren>(David Weiss)</span> met Wolfgang after his first interview <span class=paren>(with Dave Gahary)</span> to go viral on YouTube.

Dr. Eowyn is a Sandy Hook hoaxer who contributed three chapters to Fetzer's book about Sandy Hook. In 2016 it was revealed that her real name is Maria Hsia Chang. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/>https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/</a>]</span> She taught at the University of Nevada, and her old bio on the website of the university said that she <span class=quote>&quot;is a lecturer for the U.

Marine Corps War College&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm</a>]</span> She wrote a book where she praised Falun Gong, and she has also written several academic papers about East Asian political issues, where she promoted views similar to Epoch Times and Steve Bannon. The description of her book about Falun Gong says: <span class=quote>&quot;Maria Hsia Chang discusses the Falun Gong's beliefs, including their ideas on cosmology, humanity's origin, karma, reincarnation, UFOs, and the coming apocalypse. She balances an account of the Chinese government's case against the sect with an evaluation of the credibility of those accusations. Describing China's long history of secret societies that initiated powerful uprisings and sometimes overthrew dynasties, she explains the Chinese government's brutal treatment of the sect.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Falun-Gong-Maria-Hsia-Chang/dp/0300196032>https://www.amazon.com/Falun-Gong-Maria-Hsia-Chang/dp/0300196032</a>]</span> In Dr. Eowyn's book about Falun Gong, she gave thanks to <span class=quote>&quot;my husband, Professor A. James Gregor&quot;</span>. He was named to the Oppenheimer Chair of Warfighting Strategy 1996-1997 at the Marine Corps University, he was was the co-founder of the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, and he was an advisor to the Filipino leader Ferdinand Marcos. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._James_Gregor>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._James_Gregor</a>]</span> His first book was about Marxism but he later specialized in Fascism, which he said was <span class=quote>&quot;a variant of classical Marxism&quot;</span> and that the Italian <span class=quote>&quot;Fascists were almost all Marxists - serious theorists who had long been identified with Italy's intelligentsia of the Left&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[ibid.]</span>

It's interesting that Dr. Eowyn and her husband were affiliated with the Marine Corps, because Fetzer was also a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps, and Dave Gahary described himself as <span class=quote>&quot;a former submariner in the U.S. Navy&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/>https://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/</a>, <a href=https://americanfreepress.net/afp-podcast-sofia-smallstorm-talks-sandy-hook/>https://americanfreepress.net/afp-podcast-sofia-smallstorm-talks-sandy-hook/</a>]</span> Gahary was listed as the principal officer of Fetzer's publishing company Moon Rock Books. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sandy-hook-lawsuit-lenny-pozner-father-of-boy-killed-wins-defamation-suit/>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sandy-hook-lawsuit-lenny-pozner-father-of-boy-killed-wins-defamation-suit/</a>]</span> In 2014, Keith Johnson wrote that Wolfgang Halbig <span class=quote>&quot;was launched onto the public stage last February through a compelling interview with AMERICAN FREE PRESS reporter Dave Gahary&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://americanfreepress.net/web-exclusive-is-wolfgang-halbig-on-a-wild-goose-chase/>https://americanfreepress.net/web-exclusive-is-wolfgang-halbig-on-a-wild-goose-chase/</a>]</span> The trio of Fetzer, Halbig, and Gahary visited Sandy Hook in 2014, and there's a photo of them standing outside the Newtown Police Department. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.wolfganghalbig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wolfgang_Halbig_Hoax_Of_a_lifetime.pdf>https://www.wolfganghalbig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wolfgang_Halbig_Hoax_Of_a_lifetime.pdf</a>, page 146]</span>

David Weiss has a blog where he posts links to videos he has mirrored on BitChute, and he also posts links to BitChute videos on other channels. In 2018 he posted a video by China Uncensored that was basically an advertisement for how great Falun Gong is. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://stoplookthink.com/2018/06/28/what-is-falun-gong-china-uncensored/>https://stoplookthink.com/2018/06/28/what-is-falun-gong-china-uncensored/</a>]</span> Wikipedia says this about China Uncensored: <span class=quote>&quot;Until 2020, the YouTube show was compiled into longer 30-minute episodes aired by New York–based New Tang Dynasty Television, which is affiliated with Falun Gong, a new religious movement banned in China. NTD added Chinese subtitles to these longer episodes and broadcast them into mainland China. Vox has described the show as an affiliate of <span class=quote>'The Epoch Times's media empire'</span>.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Uncensored>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Uncensored</a>]</span>

In 2023 when Harry Vox did a debate with Giuseppe Vafanculo about whether Handsome Truth was a fed plant or not, Dave Gahary joined the debate to defend Handsome Truth, even though Handsome Truth's organization GDL is the most obvious fed operation. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/kA1Sl3cNaI4j/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/kA1Sl3cNaI4j/</a>]</span> Gahary was the webmaster for American Free Press, which was the successor of the Spotlight magazine which was published by the Liberty Lobby, but Eustace Mullins, L.T. Patterson, and Christopher Bollyn have all said that Liberty Lobby was covertly controlled by the communist Jew Mark Lane. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bollyn.com/the-liberty-lobbys-mark-lane-and-the-jonestown-massacre/>https://www.bollyn.com/the-liberty-lobbys-mark-lane-and-the-jonestown-massacre/</a>, <a href=https://altcensored.com/watch?v=HGPmuIaNbAQ>https://altcensored.com/watch?v=HGPmuIaNbAQ</a>]</span> <span class=paren>(However Bollyn is not necessarily a reliable source, because he lived on a kibbutz in Israel, he married the Jew Bosmat Merimsky who Bollyn said worked for Israeli military intelligence, his sister Karin Marta Bollyn married the Jew Michael Epstein, and in 2001 she was listed as a new trustee of a synagogue called Temple Solel in Arizona. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://takeourworldback.com/bollynhufschmidmurdoch.htm>http://takeourworldback.com/bollynhufschmidmurdoch.htm</a>, <a href=https://www.bollyn.com/the-law-of-the-jungle-the-jews/>https://www.bollyn.com/the-law-of-the-jungle-the-jews/</a>, <a href=http://www.takeourworldback.com/short/bollynisraeliwife.htm>http://www.takeourworldback.com/short/bollynisraeliwife.htm</a>]</span> But on the other hand it also says a lot about AFP that their star investigative reporter was Christopher Bollyn.)</span>

In 2022, Tim Rothschild appeared as a guest on a podcast called <span class=quote>&quot;Ascension of the Chessmen&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://ivy.fm/tag/tim-rothschild>https://ivy.fm/tag/tim-rothschild</a>]</span> The logo of the podcast features a man with wings hovering over a floor with Masonic checkerboard tiling. The guest on episode 11 of the podcast was described as <span class=quote>&quot;B, a wealth of knowledge into the occult, freemasonry &amp; spirituality&quot;</span>, the guest on episode 16 was described as a <span class=quote>&quot;former master mason&quot;</span>, and the guest on episode 21 was described as a <span class=quote>&quot;passed Master Freemason&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://podcastaddict.com/?podId=2645454>https://podcastaddict.com/?podId=2645454</a>]</span> Later guests included Jason Lindgren <span class=paren>(Secrets of Saturn)</span>, Lindsey Scharmyn <span class=paren>(Rogue Ways)</span>, David Weiss, the rapper ODD TV who is a flat earther, the Tartaria and mudflood YouTuber Andreas Xirtus, Benjamin Balderson, Crrow777, and Marty Leeds. So I was surprised to not see Kaufman or Cowan on the list.

Tim Rothschild's website says that he is a Kabbalistic healer: <span class=quote>&quot;As a Nondual Kabbalistic Healer, philosopher, numerologist, broadcaster and writer, Tim has ventured through the paranormal, conspiratorial, and mystical realms only to begin to understand what it means to awaken to our true nature, and live it within the Great Mystery. The core of his healing work revolves around integration of a Nondual approach to the Kabbalistic Tree Of Life as well as the Kabbalistic Universes of Consciousness, allowing the individual to come into relationship with reality as it is. The integration of this particular healing and awakening work opens the door for more possibility and potential to unfold holographically, that is, everywhere and in everything. He is a graduate of A Society of Souls, and continues this work through Advanced Studies Groups, Teacher Training programs, as well as a nondual approach to intimacy. He is also a practitioner of the MAGI process, Impersonal Movement 1 and 2 and the Work of Return. Tim is an apprentice in the 4 year ASOS class in the United Arab Emirates.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=http://www.thethirdthing.net/>http://www.thethirdthing.net/</a>]</span> The <span class=quote>&quot;MAGI Process&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;Impersonal Movement&quot;</span>, and <span class=quote>&quot;Work of Return&quot;</span> are all trademarks of Jason Schulman, who founded A Society of Souls and who calls himself a Kabbalist healer. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBmC04nf0oYC&amp;pg=PA163>https://books.google.com/books?id=BBmC04nf0oYC&amp;pg=PA163</a>]</span> So when Rothschild's LinkedIn profile says that he studied healing and energy at a mystery school from 2013 to 2017, I guess he meant the 4-year program by A Society of Souls.

When David Weiss was asked in a YouTube comment who Tim Rothschild was, he replied: <span class=quote>&quot;Tim was my friend that I worked with in the corporate world at Mercury Solar Systems. Tim was adopted and his parents have the name Rothchild <span class=paren>[sic]</span> but were middle class people with ZERO connections to anything. They lived in a small house in Nyac NY. There are millions of people named Rothchild that have no connection to anything.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://ifers.forumotion.com/t369-david-weiss-exposed#18570>https://ifers.forumotion.com/t369-david-weiss-exposed#18570</a>]</span> An article from 2011 said that Tim Rothschild was a sales representative for Mercury Solar Systems which installed solar panels. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.liherald.com/stories/taking-the-step-toward-solar-power,31409?page=1>https://www.liherald.com/stories/taking-the-step-toward-solar-power,31409?page=1</a>]</span> <span class=paren>(So I guess it's possible that he's just an average guy even though he's a kabbalist named Rothschild who was educated at a mystery school.)</span>

On March 18th 2020 UTC, David Weiss posted a clip of a video he did with Owen Benjamin, where Benjamin said: <span class=quote>&quot;I think it's the corona, if you just <span class=quote>'-ry'</span>, it's coronary. I think it's a virus of the heart, like I think it's a spiritual release. Thoughts?&quot;</span> Then Weiss answered: <span class=quote>&quot;Viruses are the cleanup mechanism in your body. If there's a dead animal on the road, the vultures come and the rodents come, and that's nature's cleanup mechanism. When you have diseased cells in your body, the viruses and bacteria come to clean it up. You don't - you know, viruses and bacteria do not cause illness. They protect you from illness.&quot;</span> And then Owen Benjamin replied <span class=quote>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/zXnbwPC4bSiI/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/zXnbwPC4bSiI/</a>, 14:30]</span>

On March 23rd 2020 UTC, David Weiss posted a video on YouTube where Aajonus Vonderplanitz said that viruses are <span class=quote>&quot;soaps, they are solvents.

In June 2020, DITRH mirrored a video by the ex-military undercover nurse Erin Marie Olszewski. Olszewski wrote that before she started her anti-vaccine organization in 2019, she worked at an anti-terrorism unit at MacDill Air Force Base. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91>https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91</a>]</span> In 2020 the Pentagon contracted General Dynamics IT to run an anti-vaccine psyop campaign on social media, where <span class=quote>&quot;In trailers and squat buildings at a facility on Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base, U.S. military personnel and contractors would use anonymous accounts on X, Facebook and other social media to spread what became an anti-vax message.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/>https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/</a>]</span> MacDill is the location of the headquarters of Special Operations Command, and Alex Jones has said that some of his staff members have worked at MacDill, but Olszewski also made her big alt media debut by appearing on InfoWars and Tucker the same day.

David Weiss mirrored a video on BitChute about how insane asylums built in the 1800s are Tartarian architecture because they couldn't have been built using horse-and-buggy technology. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/JudNoQ9Y0PsS/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/JudNoQ9Y0PsS/</a>]</span> And he mirrored another video which first discussed the <span class=quote>&quot;fallen titan Montgo&quot;</span> and then claimed that stones are petrified organs of animals. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/lk3Z6o0LOiDq/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/lk3Z6o0LOiDq/</a>]</span> Weiss also mirrored a video about mud floods called <span class=quote>&quot;Weight Of The Flood Caused A World Wide Volcanic Ash Event&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/7DBsIRiZ0jVf/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/7DBsIRiZ0jVf/</a>]</span> And Weiss mirrored a video by the flat earther Jamie Lee <span class=paren>(A Plane Truth)</span>, who said that in old buildings like churches, the domes were magnetrons which healed through magnetism, the spires were employed for Wi-Fi communication, and the fireplaces were the energy centers of the buildings. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/5rcT2DW8DGlZ/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/5rcT2DW8DGlZ/</a>, 15:25]</span> And next in the same video, Jamie Lee also said that the Tartarian Empire was destroyed by an electromagnetic vibration frequency weapon which was <span class=quote>&quot;tuned for life&quot;</span>, and that 9/11 was done with an electromagnetic vibration frequency weapon which was <span class=quote>&quot;tuned for steel molecules&quot;</span>.

After David Weiss's old website deepinsidetherabbithole.com had become inactive, it used to get redirected to Ole Dammegård's website lightonconspiracies.com. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://mileswmathis.com/interview.pdf>http://mileswmathis.com/interview.pdf</a>]</span> In February 2020, Dammegård was interviewed by Jason Goodman about the theory that 5G causes COVID. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=ole%20dammegard%20virus>https://x.com/search?q=ole%20dammegard%20virus</a>]</span> Dammegård was a regular guest on Jason Goodman's channel in early 2020. Dammegård and Jason Goodman did a livestream with Andrew Kaufman on May 11th 2020 UTC, which Goodman said was <span class=quote>&quot;one of the best conversations I've heard about #covid_19 #pandemic&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/LightOnConspira/status/1259854845646901248>https://x.com/LightOnConspira/status/1259854845646901248</a>, <a href=https://x.com/csthetruth/status/1259898731052371970>https://x.com/csthetruth/status/1259898731052371970</a>]</span> Dammegård published a blog post about a video by Aajonus Vonderplanitz on April 1st UTC and a video of Andrew Kaufman's presentation livestreamed by James True on April 4th UTC. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-only-way-to-get-a-virus-is-to-be-injected-with-it/>https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-only-way-to-get-a-virus-is-to-be-injected-with-it/</a>, <a href=https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-anatomy-of-the-covid-virus/>https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-anatomy-of-the-covid-virus/</a>]</span> In his blog post about Kaufman's video, there's a link to an earlier version of the post with the same title dated March 31st, but the earlier post has now been deleted and it's not available at the Wayback Machine. But anyway, on March 31st I believe Kaufman hadn't appeared anywhere in alt media outside of flat earth channels and his own channel. Ole Dammegård has also done an interview about flat earth with Marty Leeds. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://lightonconspiracies.com/tag/flat-earth/>https://lightonconspiracies.com/tag/flat-earth/</a>]</span>

In 2020 jeranism and David Weiss hosted a livestream where Jason Goodman debated Rose777 about whether the earth was flat or not. At the start of the video, David Weiss said: <span class=quote>&quot;So, um, I've been, you know, seeing Jason's videos for a long time, but then at the beginning of the protests, the lockdown, I caught one of Jason's streams where he was walking through Brooklyn and really standing up for New York, standing up for truth, and it blew me away. I immediately became a Patron, and I've watched almost every show he's done ever since. He does shows with Ole Dammegård a couple times a week or once a week on monday. And uh, he's really doing important work.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMEl0u174o?start=87>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMEl0u174o?start=87</a>]</span>

As of 2023, the URL of David Weiss's old website deepinsidetherabbithole.com gets redirected to Weiss's new website called stoplookthink.com, which mostly consists of links to BitChute videos by Weiss and Spacebusters. The front page of the website features 16 embedded Bitchute videos about COVID, Sandy Hook, and 9/11, but none of the videos are about flat earth, so maybe the website is supposed to appeal to people who are suspicious of flat earth. One of the videos is a copy of Sofia Smallstorm's film about Sandy Hook that is mirrored on David Weiss's BitChute channel. David Weiss, Sofia Smallstorm, and Ole Dammegård all used to be specialized in mass shootings and 9/11.

Jason Goodman now does livestreams together with John Cullen, who initially built up his following by covering the Las Vegas shooting. Cullen has come up with a theory that the deaths attributed to COVID were really caused by the H7N9 avian influenza, which seems like disinformation similar to George Webb's story about Maatje Benassi and Couey's clone theory.

In 2023 there were two shootings at Rotterdam where an Arab student at Erasmus Medical Center is supposed to have killed one person at EMC and two people at a residential area, but George Webb was the main person in alt media who was covering the shootings.

In 2022, David Weiss did an interview about flat earth on the podcast of Rob Edwards. At the beginning of the podcast, Edwards promoted Barnett's Living Free Movement and George Wiseman's AquaCure products. During the interview, David Weiss said: <span class=quote>&quot;I feel honored. I was looking at your channel. You've had some legends on.

The link takes you to a website for George Wiseman's AquaCure products, where a huge block of text at the top of the website says: <span class=quote>&quot;Natural Medicine Practitioners Tom Cowan, Andrew Kaufman and Amandha Vollmer Are ALL Utilizing THIS MACHINE&quot;</span>. The website features two videos of people who talk about how great AquaCure's products are, but the other person is Lindsey Scharmyn, who was one of the six flat earthers who were featured in James True's livestream of Andrew Kaufman's presentation.

Tom Barnett has done several interviews with Cal Washington, who is a mulatto sovereign citizen guru who is popular among flat earthers. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tom+barnett%22+%22cal+washington%22>https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tom+barnett%22+%22cal+washington%22</a>]</span> In an interview with HighImpactVlogs around April 3rd 2020 UTC, Kaufman was asked what legal strategy could be used to resist mandatory vaccines, and Kaufman replied: <span class=quote>&quot;I learned about this gentleman named Cal Washington. And he is an individual who has through his own experience and through his own learning - has studied how the law is practiced and enforced in our country. And he even actually had to spend some time behind bars to figure this out. And his only crime was not having insurance for his car. So he's a very moral person. He would definitely not cause harm to any other individual. But through this experience, he has gained a level of knowledge that is pretty incredible. And he joined up with other people in this area, and they formed this group called InPower that I would definitely - you know, refer your audience to check out. And what they did is they came up with this legal strategy which is known as - it's called a notice of liability.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7TjqzcATI&amp;t=1h12m44s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7TjqzcATI&amp;t=1h12m44s</a>]</span> A few minutes later, Kaufman said: <span class=quote>&quot;So Cal and I are actually going to both appear together on Richie from Boston's YouTube channel tomorrow evening at 5:30 Eastern, and we're gonna lay out this strategy in more detail than I'm describing it now. And you know he's really the main legal expert.&quot;</span> I don't know if the interview was canceled because I didn't find it anywhere. But nevertheless it's interesting that Kaufman was already connected to Cal Washington in early April 2020.

Tom Barnett has done several livestreams with Owen Benjamin, who also used to do livestreams with James True before they had a falling out. Barnett has also been interviewed by the flat earthers Amandha Vollmer, Crrow777, and Rogue Ways.

Alfa Vedic's AlfaCast podcast has had 168 episodes so far, which have included many repeat guests and many episodes without a guest. But their guests have still included Tom Barnett, Owen Benjamin, Tom Cowan, David Icke, Max Igan, Andrew Kaufman, Marty Leeds, Sofia Smallstorm, James True, Amandha Vollmer, Cal Washington, David Weiss, George Wiseman, and Andreas Xirtus. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://podcast.app/alfacast-p801122/>https://podcast.app/alfacast-p801122/</a>]</span>

And then, it's a spinning ball?

In 2020, I found 12 YouTube channels which had reposted Kaufman's <span class=quote>&quot;Hippocratic Hypocrisy&quot;</span> film, out of which 9 were flat earth channels, one was Kaufman's channel, and one was Amandha Vollmer's channel YumNaturals Emporium.

In April 2020, Amandha Vollmer did a presentation about Lanka's theory at EVENT 202, which was organized by the British mulatto flat earther Allegedly Dave, and which had a flat earth in its logo. Another speaker at EVENT 202 was the ex-military flat earther Shelley Lewis.

In 2021 when Amandha Vollmer was interviewed by Patrick Timpone, Timpone first discussed flat earth, and then Vollmer said: <span class=quote>&quot;<span class=paren>(57:35)</span> I think the hardest part is getting over the lies, and the fake science and the fake gurus, and all that stuff.

The Omega Institute for Holistic Studies is located about 100 km north of Manhattan in Rhinebeck, New York.

<span class=quote>&gt; Omega Institute for Holistic Studies is a non-profit educational retreat center located in Rhinebeck, New York.

<span class=quote>&gt; As for the Rockefeller ties of Weil's old <span class=quote>&quot;nemesis&quot;</span>, Ram Dass, he and Buddhist meditation guru Master Thich Nhat Hanh were involved in setting up the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society in 1991, together with the then president and CEO of the Nathan Cummings Foundation. Soon a first conference was organized at the Rockefeller's Pocantino retreat, with Steven Rockefeller writing one of the white papers. By 1995, Ram Dass and Thich Nhat Hanh both were involved in the super-elite State of the World Forum, organized by the Rockefellers, Ted Turner, Maurice Strong and other globalist new age-oriented leaders. Today Ram Dass still sits on the <span class=quote>&quot;council of sages&quot;</span> of the California Institute of Integral Studies <span class=paren>(CIIS)</span>, its largest historical donor having been Laurance Rockefeller. Decades before all these ties, Ram Dass, of course, was involved in the Laurance Rockefeller-backed Esalen Institute.</span>

Ram Dass mentioned both Laurance Rockefeller and the Omega Institute in his autobiography: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9HoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT404>https://books.google.com/books?id=v9HoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT404</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; My dear friend Joan Halifax brought Laurance Rockefeller to visit. He and I had met in the early nineties, and I'd stopped in a couple of times at his Park Avenue apartment in New York.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>[...]</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; When Laurance heard about my stroke, he contributed to the fund for my rehabilitation, my endless stream of therapists and handicap adaptations. It was wonderful to see him. In the past, we'd smoked pot together and played verbal consciousness games.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; <span class=paren>[...]</span></span>
<span class=quote>&gt; After about six months of rehab, I started traveling to speaking engagements. I gave workshops at Omega Institute in upstate New York and Breitenbush Hot Springs in Oregon, old stomping grounds where I had held retreats for years.</span>

When I googled for <span class=code>`site:eomega.org rockefeller`</span>, I found that one of the teachers listed on the website of the Omega Institute <span class=quote>&quot;launched the Transformational Change Leadership Initiative with the Rockefeller Foundation focused on women leaders in government and civil society.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/pat-mitchell>https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/pat-mitchell</a>]</span> And another teacher was <span class=quote>&quot;an artist-in-residence at the Rockefeller Foundation Study and Conference Center in Bellagio, Italy&quot;</span>. <a href=https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/alejandro-fogel>https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/alejandro-fogel</a>] And another teacher <span class=quote>&quot;toured her original musical <span class=quote>_Shine_</span> to select cities that are a part of the Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities Initiative to engage youth voices in resilience planning&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/beth-osnes>https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/beth-osnes</a>]</span> And another teacher has <span class=quote>&quot;a residency from the Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Centre&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/courtney-e-martin>https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/courtney-e-martin</a>]</span> However when I googled for <span class=code>`site:eomega.org/workshops/teachers`</span>, there were a total of over 2,000 results, so I guess it's not that unusual that a few of the teachers are affiliated with the Rockefeller Foundation, especially since the Omega Institute is located in New York. And I think the Omega Institute might list someone as a <span class=quote>&quot;teacher&quot;</span> on their website if they have just given a single talk at the institute, because even Bill Clinton is listed as one of the teachers on the website <span class=paren>(and the URL for Clinton's page features the directories <span class=code>`/workshops/teachers/`</span> like the URLs of all other <span class=quote>&quot;teachers&quot;</span>, even though I don't think all of the teachers taught a workshop)</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/president-bill-clinton>https://www.eomega.org/workshops/teachers/president-bill-clinton</a>]</span>

Someone who visited the Omega Institute in 2018 said that in the faculty dining room, there was a wall which had portraits of famous people who had visited the Omega Institute, and it had a portrait of John of God next to Gloria Steinem and Eckhart Tolle. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/why-are-portraits-of-john-of-god-and-gloria-steinem-beside-each-other-at-omega-institute/>http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/why-are-portraits-of-john-of-god-and-gloria-steinem-beside-each-other-at-omega-institute/</a>]</span> In 2017, the Omega Institute issued a press release which said: <span class=quote>&quot;We are profoundly disheartened by the serious allegations of sexual misconduct by João Teixeira de Faria <span class=paren>(John of God)</span> at his facility in Brazil. As a lifelong learning organization committed to exploring different modalities of holistic healing, Omega offered an opportunity to participate in John of God's programs at our Rhinebeck, New York, campus a number of times beginning in 2007 and ending in 2017.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/about-omega/press-center/statement-from-omega-regarding-john-of-god-allegations>https://www.eomega.org/about-omega/press-center/statement-from-omega-regarding-john-of-god-allegations</a>]</span>

It's interesting that the Omega Institute was named after a concept developed by a Jesuit priest, because John of God says that he built his Casa compound in Brazil at the instruction of St. Ignatius of Loyola. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.johnofgod-healing.com/about-the-casa/>https://www.johnofgod-healing.com/about-the-casa/</a>]</span> John of God says that there are 33 <span class=quote>&quot;entities&quot;</span> who he is able to channel and who also reside at his Casa compound. They include St. Ignatius and famous historical doctors, but they also include Theosophical ascended masters like Kuthumi, Morya, and Serapis Bey. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20190212163432/www.johnofgodlove.com/entities/>http://web.archive.org/web/20190212163432/www.johnofgodlove.com/entities/</a>, <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GVuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185>https://books.google.com/books?id=3GVuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185</a>]</span> Supposedly when Henry Steel Olcott's own master Morya was unavailable, Olcott was given occult training by Serapis Bey. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis_Bey>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis_Bey</a>]</span> A volunteer at the Casa said: <span class=quote>&quot;We pray the Lord's Prayer because Dom Inacio, the patron of the Casa, was a Jesuit, and we pray the Hail Mary because he was devoted to Mother Mary. When I told The Entity that foreigners did not want to say the prayers, he replied: <span class=quote>'But my daughter, the master of all masters is Jesus! Women must be worshipped, especially the mother of the Master. The entities of the Casa are Jesuit!'</span>&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GVuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152>https://books.google.com/books?id=3GVuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152</a>]</span>

The website of the Omega Institute says that one of the three cofounders of the institute was the Sufi mystic Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.eomega.org/about/overview/history>https://www.eomega.org/about/overview/history</a>]</span> He was born in London, and his sister Noor worked for British intelligence according to a book titled <span class=quote>_ Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan_</span>.

<h2><a href=#Tom_Cowan name=Tom_Cowan>##</a> Tom Cowan</h2>
Like many other leading no-virusniks, Cowan also has a background in occultism, because he set up an anthroposophical medical practice in the 80s and he served as the vice president of the <span class=quote>&quot;Physicians Association for Anthroposophical Medicine&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.westonaprice.org/about-us/board-of-directors/>https://www.westonaprice.org/about-us/board-of-directors/</a>]</span> In one of his books, Cowan wrote that in 1983 when he attended an anthroposophical conference, he was so impressed with a speech he heard that he decided that he wanted to one day be able to speak from the same <span class=quote>&quot;place of knowing&quot;</span> as the speaker, and he wrote that <span class=quote>&quot;I had a sense that learning anthroposophy would provide me with the path&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgJODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41>https://books.google.com/books?id=rgJODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41</a>]</span> Then he wrote that he spent three months learning <span class=quote>&quot;anthroposophical medicine from three of the country's best practitioners, who had agreed to take me on as an apprentice.&quot;</span> Cowan wrote that he one of his teachers was Dr. Otto Wolff, who Cowan described as <span class=quote>&quot;the main person who came from Europe to start anthroposophical medicine in the United States&quot;</span>, and who taught Cowan <span class=quote>&quot;how to memorize the anthroposophical and homeopathic pharmacopeia, sing in a choir, and learn the metals, the constellations, plants, gardening, and the movement of water.&quot;</span>

In a speech that Rudolf Steiner gave in 1915, he said that in order to achieve a spiritual equilibrium, it is necessary for people to embrace the principles of Lucifer and Ahriman, and he said that <span class=quote>&quot;we can detect a Luciferic remnant in the east, which, I would say, is a wise guiding force left behind for the evolution of mankind in general&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/ChrLuc_index.html>https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/ChrLuc_index.html</a>]</span> Steiner also said that the current epoch was the Fifth Post-Atlantean Epoch and that <span class=quote>&quot;The man of the Fifth Post-Atlantean Epoch, who confronts Ahriman-Mephistopheles, must take Lucifer into himself.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/BalWorld/19141120p01.html>https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/BalWorld/19141120p01.html</a>]</span> Sounds just like James True.

In a book Cowan published in 2016, he claimed that the heart is not a pump. The description of the book says: <span class=quote>&quot;In this deeply personal, rigorous, and riveting account, Dr. Cowan offers up a daring claim: Not only was Steiner correct that the heart is not a pump, but our understanding of heart disease - with its origins in the blood vessels - is completely wrong.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Human-Heart-Cosmic-Understand-Cardiovascular/dp/1603586199>https://www.amazon.com/Human-Heart-Cosmic-Understand-Cardiovascular/dp/1603586199</a>]</span>

In December 2019 Tom Cowan published a blog post titled <span class=quote>&quot;A Big Change in EMFs Preceded Each Pandemic&quot;</span>, where he wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;I recently finished reading a very sobering book on the history of electricity and its effects on life called <span class=quote>'The Invisible Rainbow'</span> by Arthur Firstenberg. During the coming weeks and months, I will share revelations I gained from reading this masterpiece, as in many ways it supports and extends the primary thesis of my last three books.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog?page=5>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog?page=5</a>, <a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/a-big-change-in-emfs-preceded-each-pandemic>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/a-big-change-in-emfs-preceded-each-pandemic</a>]</span> So was Cowan already being coached on the no-virus narrative in 2019? Or he was told to read the book in advance if COVID was planned in advance? I don't think it's necessarily too likely, but it seems odd how Cowan had already planned that he was going to present his revelations from the book <span class=quote>&quot;during the coming weeks and months&quot;</span>. About three months later he was catapulted to fame by his video where he discussed the book.

Tom Cowan's first viral video about COVID consisted of a short 11-minute talk he gave on March 12th 2020 local time at the <span class=quote>&quot;Health And Human Rights Summit&quot;</span> in Arizona. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/</a>]</span> There's a copy of the video at BitChute where the description says <span class=quote>&quot;Camera, sound and editing by Joshua Coleman.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/</a>]</span> In 2020, Joshua Coleman organized an anti-vaccine event in California together with the Scientologist Jonathan Lockwood. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://t.me/s/co_appleseed>https://t.me/s/co_appleseed</a>, <a href=https://x.com/JNTHN_LCKWD/status/1576004158246699008>https://x.com/JNTHN_LCKWD/status/1576004158246699008</a>]</span> Lockwood is also the excecutive director of Conscience Coalition, which is an anti-vaccine organization that was cofounded in 2019 by Renee Bessone and her husband Greg Mitchell. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://consciencecoalition.com/press/>https://consciencecoalition.com/press/</a>]</span> Mitchell was the primary lobbyist for the Church of Scientology in Washington DC. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/church-of-scientology-washington-lobbyist-2015-4>https://www.businessinsider.com/church-of-scientology-washington-lobbyist-2015-4</a>]</span> His wife Renee Bessone has reached OT level VIII, which is the highest auditing level in Scientology. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.truthaboutscientology.com/stats/by-name/r/renee-bessone.html>https://www.truthaboutscientology.com/stats/by-name/r/renee-bessone.html</a>]</span> Mitchell's lobbying firm has also represented Soros's Open Society Policy Center, and the Mitchell Firm is listed as having received 80,000 USD from Open Society Policy Center in 2006, 80,000 USD in 2007, 55,000 USD in 2008, and 70,000 USD in 2013. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/>https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/</a>, <a href=https://www.opensecrets.org/Lobby/firmsum.php?id=F223880&amp;year=2013>https://www.opensecrets.org/Lobby/firmsum.php?id=F223880&amp;year=2013</a>]</span> The domain name of Conscience Coalition was registered by Timothy Akey, who is a former pharmaceutical representative. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/>https://www.facebook.com/notes/4567792496626364/</a>]</span>

In 2020 Cowan published a blog post where he wrote said that the authors of a scientific paper wrote that they <span class=quote>&quot;designed 37 pairs of nested PCRs spanning the genome on the basis of the coronavirus reference sequence&quot;</span>, which Cowan explained meant that <span class=quote>&quot;rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20201015211840/https://drtomcowan.com/only-poisoned-monkey-kidney-cells-grew-the-virus/>http://web.archive.org/web/20201015211840/https://drtomcowan.com/only-poisoned-monkey-kidney-cells-grew-the-virus/</a>]</span> Cowan later quietly edited his article to remove the text about the 37 base pairs, but he didn't include any note in the article which would've pointed out that the old version was incorrect. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/only-poisoned-monkey-kidney-cells-grew-the-virus>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/only-poisoned-monkey-kidney-cells-grew-the-virus</a>]</span> Actually the paper he referred to was talking about a set of 37 PCR amplicons which covered the entire genome, or nearly the entire genome apart from small parts at the 5' and 3' UTRs. So the average length of the amplicons would've probably been around 900 or 1000 bases. In the first version of the ARCTIC protocol, there were similarly 98 nested PCR amplicons which covered about 99.8% of the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome, and the average length of the amplicons was about 400 bases. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/blob/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1/nCoV-2019.bed>https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/blob/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1/nCoV-2019.bed</a>]</span> In an article where Jon Rappoport commented on Cowan's article, he quoted the same text about the 37 base pairs I quoted above but he didn't point out any error within the text, which is a good indication of how much he knows about genetics. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/>https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/</a>]</span> Rappoport is a rabbinic surname of the Kohanic line. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappaport_family>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappaport_family</a>]</span>

During an interview with the flat earther Steve Falconer, Tom Cowan did said that he grew up in a Jewish ghetto and he was a member of a Jewish country club: <span class=quote>&quot;I grew up in a what I would call a Jewish ghetto, but you know Jewish ghettos are a little bit more high - you know, like it was not a, uh, I mean, I've lived in a brick shack, basically when I grew up.

<h2><a href=#Similarities_between_early_no_virus_presentations name=Similarities_between_early_no_virus_presentations>##</a> Similarities between early no-virus presentations</h2>
In videos in March 2020, Andrew Kaufman, Tom Cowan, Sofia Smallstorm, and Steve Falconer all presented a suspiciously similar version of the no-virus narrative. For example they all said that COVID may have been caused by 5G, and they all said that viruses are produced by the human body in response to stress <span class=paren>(which later seems to have become a heresy among the no-virus crowd)</span>.

On March 23rd 2020 local time, Sofia Smallstorm appeared as a guest in an episode of the jeranismRAW flat earth podcast, where the other two guests were the flat earthers David Weiss and Jason Lindgren. Smallstorm said: <span class=quote>&quot;<span class=paren>(9:51)</span> Viruses actually are healing agents, because they are a little like nanobatteries. They're smaller than cells, they're protein-containing and crystalline material - they're DNA-ordered, they're coded for. And it means that when there is a lot of cellular injury, whether it's from disease or whatever, viruses are deployed, they are created and deployed. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(36:46)</span> Flu is not a virally caused disease. Arthur Firstenberg's book <span class=quote>_The Invisible Rainbow_</span> will tell you that flu is primarily generated by electricity in the homes, which is actually quite believable. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(51:45)</span> So one thing that we haven't talked about here is the 5G angle in Wuhan.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstuEFrcjTI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstuEFrcjTI</a>]</span>

Tom Cowan's first viral video about COVID consisted of a short 11-minute talk he gave on March 12th 2020 local time at the <span class=quote>&quot;Health And Human Rights Summit&quot;</span> in Arizona. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/</a>]</span> During the talk, Cowan said: <span class=quote>&quot;<span class=paren>(2:26)</span> When the cells get poisoned, they try to purify themselves by excreting debris, which we call viruses. If you go to the current theory of viruses called exosomes and the latest head of the NIH giving you a talk on the complexity of viruses, you will see this is perfectly in line with the current thinking on what a virus really is. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(5:37)</span> They even did it with horses who apparently got the Spanish flu, and they put bags over their head, and the horses sneezed in the bag, and they put the bag over the next horse, and not one horse got sick. You can read about this in a book called <span class=quote>_The Invisible Rainbow_</span> by Arthur Firstenberg, who chronicles all the steps in the electrification of the earth and how within six months there was a new flu pandemic all over the world. <span class=paren>[...]</span> <span class=paren>(7:50)</span> Anybody want to make one guess as to where the first completely blanketed 5G city in the world was?&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/XV4nqpXf4s71/</a>]</span>

In an interview that Andrew Kaufman did with James True on March 24th 2020 UTC, he said: <span class=quote>&quot;I want to just point out a couple of studies that may also be somewhat reassuring, and I found these in the book <span class=quote>_The Invisible Rainbow_</span> which I encourage you to check out. And it talks about the relationship between electricity and pandemics and disease.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCZkJLc6ho&amp;t=1h36m34s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCZkJLc6ho&amp;t=1h36m34s</a>]</span> During the same interview, James True said that there was a rollout of 5G in Wuhan and Italy, which Kaufman discussed himself in his other presentations. In a presentation on March 30th UTC, Kaufman said: <span class=quote>&quot;So what is it that causes us to make more of these exosomes and throw them out into our circulation? So it turns out that almost every type of insult to the body would actually cause this prod this process to occur, so toxic substances, and I found several papers looking at this - some of them looked at environmental toxins such as heavy metals like arsenic and organic chemical toxins - also found evidence about bacterial toxins, and I have a slide that I'll show you in a minute so there's clearly has a role in communication or possibly removal of toxic substances that damage our cells.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGd7-vvd9Y?t=25m1s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGd7-vvd9Y?t=25m1s</a>]</span>

On March 4th 2020 which as far as I know was before Kaufman or Cowan had started talking about germ theory, a video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Important Information on Coronavirus 5G Kung Flu&quot;</span> was published by Steve Falconer. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/mWcUoESRO0c5/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/mWcUoESRO0c5/</a>]</span> In the video Falconer said that 5G causes COVID, and the video also included a long segment of a radio show from 2009 where Aajonus Vonderplanitz talked about how viruses are <span class=quote>&quot;solvents&quot;</span> or <span class=quote>&quot;soaps&quot;</span> or <span class=quote>&quot;enzymes to fractionate tissue for waste elimination&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://whale.to/a/aajonus-interview-apr-2009.pdf>http://whale.to/a/aajonus-interview-apr-2009.pdf</a>]</span> I don't remember if Falconer talked about the <span class=quote>_Invisible Rainbow_</span> book though.

During the talk on March 30th, Kaufman actually credited Stefan Lanka and Tom Cowan as inspirations for his theory. But I didn't see anywhere in March 2020 that Smallstorm credited Kaufman, Cowan, or Falconer, or that Cowan credited Smallstorm, Kaufman, or Falconer, even though later in an interview in April 2020, Cowan said that a webinar by Kaufman was the source of some of his information. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/what-s-in-your-water-part-1>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/what-s-in-your-water-part-1</a>]</span>

In an interview with Robert David Steele that was published on April 1st 2020 UTC, Sacha Stone said that <span class=quote>&quot;a virus is an excretion from living cells that happens as a detoxification phenomenon&quot;</span>, and he talked about the <span class=quote>_Invisible Rainbow_</span> book and he said that COVID was caused by 5G. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/m4Qx_7FDunE/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/m4Qx_7FDunE/</a>]</span> And then Robert David Steele also said that he had a 17-page summary of the book on his website.

<h2><a href=#EVENT_202 name=EVENT_202>##</a> EVENT 202</h2>
EVENT 202 was a virtual conference that was held on April 30th 2020. Even though the main theme of EVENT 202 was COVID, several of the speakers at EVENT 202 were anti-5G activists or alternative health advocates who barely mentioned COVID in their presentation.

The logo of EVENT 202 featured a disc earth surrounded by the Antarctic ice wall. The main organizer of EVENT 202 is supposed to have been the British mulatto flat earther Dave Murphy, who is also known as Allegedly Dave, even though it could be that he only served as the figurehead of EVENT 202. One of the speakers at EVENT 202 was the ex-military flat earther Shelley Lewis, who made a flat earth film together with the ex-military flat earther Joshua Michael Gennari.

On March 20th 2020 UTC David Weiss mirrored a video where Allegedly Dave said: <span class=quote>&quot;Everyone has a coronavirus and every other virus and bacteria you can possibly <span class=quote>'catch'</span>. Because the body manufactures viruses and bacteria to get rid of toxicity and dead and dying tissue. Viruses do not cause disease. They are a consequence of the body dealing with disease, or the toxicity.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/1sq1fElcea0n/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/1sq1fElcea0n/</a>, 2:15]</span>

Another speaker at EVENT 202 was Amandha Vollmer, whose presentation focused on Stefan Lanka's theory. Andrew Kaufman was earlier announced as one of the speakers for EVENT 202, but his appearance seems to have been canceled, and his page on the website of EVENT 202 was later removed. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/EliTheWatchman/status/1254952618260140032>https://x.com/EliTheWatchman/status/1254952618260140032</a>, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200501055658/https://event202.org/speakers/andy-kaufman/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200501055658/https://event202.org/speakers/andy-kaufman/</a>]</span>

Other speakers at EVENT 202 included these people:

<span class=list>- Ron Angell: he spoke about 5G, AI, and 9/11. He is also a member of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, which was founded by Richard Gage. Gage has done an interview with Andrew Kaufman and his website is sponsored by Kaufman's nutritional supplement products. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://richardgage911.substack.com/p/dr-andrew-kaufman-no-proof-of-covid19>https://richardgage911.substack.com/p/dr-andrew-kaufman-no-proof-of-covid19</a>, <a href=https://richardgage911.org/fulvic-mineral-supplement-with-andrew-kaufman-md/>https://richardgage911.org/fulvic-mineral-supplement-with-andrew-kaufman-md/</a>]</span> Do all of these veterans of the controlled opposition really get fooled by Kaufman, or are they following a script that they're getting from some central location?</span>
<span class=list>- David A Barstis: his bio on the old website of EVENT 202 says: <span class=quote>&quot;He actively investigated the Sandy Hook capstone incident, and documented footage can be found at wearechangect/Wolfgang Halbig at YouTube. David is an associate in law enforcement and an advocate of freedom with a breadth of first hand experience in common law and the legal system and their courts.&quot;</span> <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200501101644/https://event202.org/speakers/david-alan-barstis/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200501101644/https://event202.org/speakers/david-alan-barstis/</a>] So he's yet another Sandy Hook hoaxer who is associated with law enforcement, just like Halbig. Halbig's famous 16 questions about Sandy Hook were debunked by C. W.

<span class=list>- Derek Broze: in his presentation at EVENT 202, he introduced himself by saying that he has made an anti-5G documentary and a documentary about pedophile networks, but his presentation focused on issues like how people can free themselves from the system and how people can take control of their health.</span>
<span class=list>- Jennifer Bruce: her profile on the website of EVENT 202 says that she is a quality consultant for the pharmaceutical industry and that she has been investigating the dangers of fast-tracked vaccine products, but her profile also says that she is trained in <span class=quote>&quot;rebirthing and divine breath&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;shamanic journey-work&quot;</span>, and <span class=quote>&quot;advanced Gestalt therapy leadership&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200501094401/https://event202.org/speakers/jennifer-bruce/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200501094401/https://event202.org/speakers/jennifer-bruce/</a>]</span></span>

<span class=list>- Cyrus Parsa: he is supposedly an AI expert who says that the CCP is going to enslave humanity through AI, and he has also focused on the topics of COVID and 5G. The oldest tweet I found which mentioned Parsa was made on October 29th 2019 UTC by an account called <span class=quote>&quot;Informal Warfare&quot;</span> whose profile picture is a drawing of Alex Jones, and the second oldest tweet I found was a link to an interview that Parsa did with Owen Shroyer on October 29th 2019 UTC. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&amp;f=live</a>]</span> In December 2019, Parsa filed a lawsuit against <span class=quote>&quot;Google L.L.C, Facebook inc, DeepMind Inc, Alphabet Inc, Neuralink Inc, Tesla Inc, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, CISON PR NewsWire &amp; John Doe's 1-29&quot;</span> for reasons such as <span class=quote>&quot;MISUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, CYBERNETICS, ROBOTICS, BIOMETRICS, BIOENGINEERING, 5G AND QUANTUM COMPUTING TECNNOLOGY&quot;</span>, and for transfering AI technology to China, and for violation of several genocide conventions because of China's treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Christians, and Falun Gong. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&amp;context=historical>https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&amp;context=historical</a>]</span> One of the oldest tweets I found which mentioned Parsa was posted by an account named <span class=quote>&quot;Uyghurtrailblazer&quot;</span> which tweeted: <span class=quote>&quot;A historic day for the Uyghurs and other victims of China.

<span class=list>- Kate Shemirani: she is a former nurse who is now one of the most famous anti-vaxxers in Britain, and who is also known as an anti-5G activist.</span>
<span class=list>- Celeste Solum: she claims that she's a former employee of FEMA and that she is a Jew who converted to Christianity. As proof that she used to work for FEMA, she showed her certificate for FEMA's <span class=quote>&quot;Professional Development Emergency Management Series&quot;</span> in a YouTube video which has now been deleted, but her bio on her website also says: <span class=quote>&quot;Celeste has worked as a contractor for Homeland Security and FEMA. Her training and activations include the infamous day of 911, flood and earthquake operations, mass casualty exercises, and numerous other operations. Celeste is FEMA certified and has completed the Professional Development Emergency Management Series.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://shepherdsheart.life/blogs/on-the-farm/bio>https://shepherdsheart.life/blogs/on-the-farm/bio</a>]</span> However the Professional Development Emergency Management Series by FEMA is series of fairly basic-level independent study courses which seems like it might be completed by someone who doesn't work full-time for FEMA or by someone who works for some other government agency. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://training.fema.gov/is/searchis.aspx?search=PDS>https://training.fema.gov/is/searchis.aspx?search=PDS</a>]</span> Patricia Negron <span class=paren>(Trish the Dish)</span> used to be featured on George Webb's live streams, but she said that Webb used to take courses to get some kind of a certification from the DHS: <span class=quote>&quot;Someone asked if George Webb is an operative. And he definitely is some kind of an operative. Because one of the things I learned during this lawsuit was George kept trying to file to intervene, which drives up the costs for anyone who's involved. And so, he's filing all this sh*t again and again and again. And one of the things that he filed was a certification for the Department of Homeland Security, level 3, that he apparently got - I looked at the dates - during the time that I was doing live streams with him and Jason. And he never mentioned any of this. He would always say, he's going over to his son's house, or somewhere to meet with someone or something. He was doing this training program with Department of Homeland Security.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN6GL9_KfFs&amp;t=49m13s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN6GL9_KfFs&amp;t=49m13s</a>]</span> However I think Celeste might be genuinely Christian and genuinely interested in conspiracy theories, because the obituary of her husband mentioned that he and Celeste were devout Christians and that he was a fan of Steve Quayle: <span class=quote>&quot;In later life, David married Celeste Bishop. Together they walked in devout faith enjoying the Holy Scriptures, prayer, and worship. <span class=paren>[...]</span> Each day David arose and after reflection upon our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and His Word, David would check the news going always to Steve Quayle's site first, a man he has admired for many years.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/202850518/david-phillip-solum>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/202850518/david-phillip-solum</a>]</span> Celeste said that <span class=quote>&quot;when I was at FEMA, I was a source of Steve Quayle's.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/8VZTSaQXiPbn/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/8VZTSaQXiPbn/</a>, 2:58]</span> She was also a speaker at Quayle's True Legends 2020 conference. The first video on BitChute that features Celeste is an interview she did together with Steve Quayle on the Hagmann Report. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=celeste%20solum&amp;kind=video&amp;sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=celeste%20solum&amp;kind=video&amp;sort=old</a>]</span></span>
<span class=list>- Mark Steele: he is an anti-5G activist and a supposed DEW expert with a heavy British accent. He was one of the first people who started to say that COVID was caused by 5G, along with Greg Reese, Sacha Stone, and Robert David Steele.</span>

I don't know if EVENT 202 was originally supposed to be about 5G and not COVID, because many of its speakers were anti-5G activists, and the old website of EVENT 202 had three alternating banner images, where two of the images were about 5G and the third image was of a drone. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200501170954/https://event202.org/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200501170954/https://event202.org/</a>]</span>

The website of EVENT 202 was last updated in 2021, but at that time the content about the original EVENT 202 had been removed, and the website had been repurposed to promote a bunch of totally-grassroots <span class=quote>&quot;health freedom rallies&quot;</span> in the UK. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://event202.org/>https://event202.org/</a>]</span> They had names like <span class=quote>&quot;A March For Freedom&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;Central London Freedom Rally&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;Unite for Freedom&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;Worldwide Demonstration for Freedom, Peace &amp; Human Rights&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;We Do Not Consent!&quot;</span>, <span class=quote>&quot;United Worldwide!&quot;</span>, and <span class=quote>&quot;Medical Freedom March&quot;</span>. David Icke was the main speaker in many of the rallies, and several of the British <span class=quote>&quot;freedom rallies&quot;</span> also featured a remote video presentation by Andrew Kaufman. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22andrew+kaufman%22+british+freedom+rally>https://www.google.com/search?q=%22andrew+kaufman%22+british+freedom+rally</a>]</span>

I haven't investigated the British rallies, but in 2019 in the United States, there was a rally called <span class=quote>&quot;Millions March Against Mandatory Vaccination&quot;</span> whose primary coordinators included Kevin Tuttle's organization Wisconsin United for Freedom and Erin Marie Olszewski's organization Florida Freedom Alliance. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://nationandstate.com/2019/10/12/flvaxgate-controlled-opposition-vaccine-groups-in-florida-carry-out-sophisticated-cointelpro-type-operation>https://nationandstate.com/2019/10/12/flvaxgate-controlled-opposition-vaccine-groups-in-florida-carry-out-sophisticated-cointelpro-type-operation</a>]</span> Both organizations were founded in 2019, and the domain names of both of their websites were registered in April 2019. Tuttle's LinkedIn profile has now been deleted, but it used to say that he worked as a <span class=quote>&quot;Public Affairs Officer&quot;</span> in the United States Air Force from 2001 to 2007. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://i.ibb.co/rFdhHPM/kevin-tuttle-linkedin-public-affairs-officer.png>https://i.ibb.co/rFdhHPM/kevin-tuttle-linkedin-public-affairs-officer.png</a>]</span> Tuttle's father moved to Israel and changed his name to Yeriel Even-Pinah. Olszewski wrote that she worked <span class=quote>&quot;in the antiterrorism units at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Most of what happened there is stuff that I can't talk about. Even the fact that there is an antiterrorism unit there isn't known by many people.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91>https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91</a>]</span> In 2020 the Pentagon contracted General Dynamics IT to run an anti-vaccine psyop campaign on social media, where <span class=quote>&quot;In trailers and squat buildings at a facility on Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base, U.S. military personnel and contractors would use anonymous accounts on X, Facebook and other social media to spread what became an anti-vax message.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/>https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/</a>]</span> Olszewski was previously virtually unknown, but when in 2020 she emerged as the <span class=quote>&quot;undercover epicenter nurse&quot;</span>, she was interviewed the same day by InfoWars, Tucker Carlson, and Del Bigtree. The previous day her video about being an undercover nurse was posted on David Icke's website. When she first came out as the undercover nurse, some of the first people who mentioned her on Twitter were David Icke, his son Gareth, an Alex Jones fan account, a flat earth account called ACSWorldNews, and a bunch of Qtards. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-06-11%20%28%22undercover%20nurse%22%20OR%20erin%20olszewski%29&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-06-11%20%28%22undercover%20nurse%22%20OR%20erin%20olszewski%29&amp;f=live</a>]</span> A third ex-military anti-vaxxer is Dawn Jolly, whose LinkedIn profile says that she served as an <span class=quote>&quot;Operations Specialist&quot;</span> at the U.S. Navy from 2001 to 2003 and that she worked for Pfizer from 2014 to 2016. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/healthypatriot/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/healthypatriot/</a>]</span> In 2019, Dawn Jolly founded an anti-vax non-profit called CT Freedom Alliance, and like Olszewski, she has appeared as a guest on Fox News. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://wethepatriotsusa.org/617-2/>https://wethepatriotsusa.org/617-2/</a>]</span> So I have found three different anti-vax organizations that have the word <span class=quote>&quot;Freedom&quot;</span> in their name and that were founded in 2019 by someone who calls themselves ex-military <span class=paren>(which is a bit off-topic, but I was reminded of it by all of the British rallies that had the word <span class=quote>&quot;Freedom&quot;</span> in their name)</span>.

<h2><a href=#Dawn_Lester_and_David_Parker name=Dawn_Lester_and_David_Parker>##</a> Dawn Lester and David Parker</h2>
When I searched for the earliest tweets about Dawn Lester, the first tweet I found was from February 25th 2020 UTC about her appearance on The Higherside Chats podcast. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22dawn%20lester%22%20until%3A2020-5-1&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22dawn%20lester%22%20until%3A2020-5-1&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/HighersideChats/status/1232404772428206081>https://x.com/HighersideChats/status/1232404772428206081</a>]</span> After that there were several other links about her interview with The Higherside Chats until a tweet from March 24th UTC which mentioned that she had also been interviewed by Crrow777. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/bobduff80/status/1242428576244404225>https://x.com/bobduff80/status/1242428576244404225</a>]</span> After her interviews from THC and Crrow777, her third appearance in alt media I saw mentioned on Twitter was an interview she did with Andrew Kaufman. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/CyberSpaceGod/status/1246202009897840646>https://x.com/CyberSpaceGod/status/1246202009897840646</a>]</span>

I think Greg Carlwood who runs the Higherside Chats podcast is also a flat earther, because the description of his interview with the flat earther Eric DuBay said: <span class=quote>&quot;A multi-generational conspiracy has succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick out up the constant Earth, shape it right into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! The finest cowl-up of all time, Nasa and Freemasonry's biggest mystery, is that we are residing on a plane, not a planet, that Earth is the flat, desk bound middle of the universe.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgXYdvN8wb4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgXYdvN8wb4</a>]</span> The Higherside Chats has also interviewed other flat earthers like Crrow777, Jeran Campanella, Sofia Smallstorm, Marty Leeds, Freeman Fly, and Mark Devlin. In August 2017 when THC interviewed Jeran Campanella, they talked about Fomenko and New Chronology, even though it was before the Tartaria nonsense was popularized among flat earthers in 2018. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0h8Nc4yiMg>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0h8Nc4yiMg</a>]</span> THC also did an interview with Eric Dubay in March 2015 which was really early on into the flat earth psyop. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZS0etOOeP4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZS0etOOeP4</a>]</span> In 2017, THC and Eddie Bravo's podcast co-hosted a live event which featured a debate about flat earth between the flat earther Eddie Bravo and some audience members. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85Xw4UhA3Dg>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85Xw4UhA3Dg</a>]</span>

The book <span class=quote>&quot;What Really Makes You Ill?: Why Everything You Thought You Knew About Disease Is Wrong&quot;</span> by Dawn Lester and David Parker was published at Amazon in December 2019. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082ZPVLZ5>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082ZPVLZ5</a>]</span> A tweet from March 25th UTC showed that the book had only one customer review on Amazon, even though by April 2023 it had 1,240 reviews. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/TaoistGroup/status/1242719542658371585>https://x.com/TaoistGroup/status/1242719542658371585</a>]</span> Someone who posted a blog comment in June 2020 wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;I checked on Amazon who is actually buying that book and giving it 5 star reviews <span class=paren>(87% out of the 61 reviews)</span>.

On April 7th 2020, two new episodes of the Alchemy podcast by John Gibbons were released, where one episode featured Dawn Lester and David Parker as guests, and the other episode featured Wayne McRoy as a guest. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/531306530/alchemy/alchemy-099-dawn-lester-david-parker-what-really-makes-you-ill>https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/531306530/alchemy/alchemy-099-dawn-lester-david-parker-what-really-makes-you-ill</a>]</span> Before that the podcast had been on a hiatus for 8 months, and after that it only continued for 9 more episodes, where the guests were Crrow777, David Icke, Max Igan, Jacob Liberman, Pierre Sabak, David Weiss, Tom Cowan, Amandha Vollmer, and Andy Breen <span class=paren>(so at least 6 of last 9 guests are people who had started to say that SARS-CoV-2 does not exist by April 2020 and at least 4 of them have also said that the earth is flat)</span>.

When Wayne McRoy did his alt media debut on Crrow777's podcast in 2017, Jason Lindgren said that McRoy was <span class=quote>&quot;somebody who's never done an interview at all&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLhU43MibM&amp;t=6s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLhU43MibM&amp;t=6s</a>]</span> McRoy was later been a recurrent guest on Crrow777's podcast and a co-host on Jason Lindgren's podcast. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.crrow777radio.com/wayne-mcroy-playlist-free/>https://www.crrow777radio.com/wayne-mcroy-playlist-free/</a>]</span> Almost all of the interviews on McRoy's Rokfin channel were done with flat earthers like Crrow777, Rose777, and Freeman Fly. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://rokfin.com/waynemcroy>https://rokfin.com/waynemcroy</a>]</span> McRoy and Rose777 are also co-hosts of a podcast called <span class=quote>&quot;The New Poppycock Report&quot;</span>.

In a snapshot of Dawn Lester and David Parker's website from April 2020, there's links to a total of four interviews they had done at that point, which were the interviews with The Higherside Chats, Crrow777, Andrew Kaufman, and the Alchemy podcast of John Gibbons. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200427155343/https://www.whatreallymakesyouill.com/podcasts.html>http://web.archive.org/web/20200427155343/https://www.whatreallymakesyouill.com/podcasts.html</a>]</span>

In 2018, The Higherside Chats podcast did an interview with Neil Kramer who was a faculty member at the Omega Institute of Holistic Studies, and their next guest a few days later was Sofia Smallstorm. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2019199>https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2019199</a>]</span> They have also interviewed Andrew Kaufman, Max Igan, Crrow777, and Sally Fallon Morell.

There's a Twitter account called SoundwavePromo1 whose bio says: <span class=quote>&quot;I make clips for Sam Tripoli &amp; The Higherside Chats! | Helping Creators Grow Their Audience! | Podcast Promoter&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1>https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1</a>]</span> His most recent tweets also included several tweets where he promoted Amazing Polly. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1766902356506218983>https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1766902356506218983</a>]</span> And he has also promoted David Weiss's Flat Earth Podcast. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1346559133407879168>https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1346559133407879168</a>, <a href=https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1400110599292428294>https://x.com/SoundwavePromo1/status/1400110599292428294</a>]</span> David Weiss has a blog where he posts links to videos he has mirrored on BitChute, but in early 2020 he posted several videos by Amazing Polly <span class=paren>(right next to videos which said that stones are petrified organs of titans and that viruses are not real)</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://stoplookthink.com/all-content/page/7/>https://stoplookthink.com/all-content/page/7/</a>]</span> Amazing Polly was an early player in establishing the narrative that the pandemic was fake, and she was one of the main people in alt media who was <span class=quote>&quot;exposing&quot;</span> Colleen Smith as an expert in medical simulation, along with her fellow Qtard Christine Polon, the flat earthers Karen B and Brian Staveley, and Jason Goodman.

<h2><a href=#The_End_of_COVID_event_Kelly_Brogan_and_alchemy name=The_End_of_COVID_event_Kelly_Brogan_and_alchemy>##</a> The End of COVID event, Kelly Brogan, and alchemy</h2>
In July 2023, there was an online event called <span class=quote>&quot;End of COVID&quot;</span> which consisted of a series of about 100 presentations that were mainly focused on the no-virus theory. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://theendofcovid.com/>https://theendofcovid.com/</a>]</span>

In the poster for the event, the <span class=quote>&quot;directors&quot;</span> of the event are listed as Kelly Brogan, the ex-military guy Alec Zeck, the flat earther Amandha Vollmer, Mike Winner, and Dawn Lester.

I didn't know who Kelly Brogan was, but apparently she's also a flat earther, and there's a clip of an interview she did with David Weiss where she said that the earth was flat. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG_SLrAEZf4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG_SLrAEZf4</a>]</span>

The <span class=quote>&quot;producers&quot;</span> of the event are listed as The Way Forward <span class=paren>(Alec Zeck)</span>, Alfa Vedic <span class=paren>(Barre Lando and Mike Winner)</span>, and The Sovereign's Way <span class=paren>(Greg Paul)</span>. The Alfa Vedic podcast has featured several flat earthers as guests, like David Weiss, James True, Marty Leeds, FPV Angel, One Conscience, Owen Benjamin, Sofia Smallstorm, Kelly Brogan, and Amandha Vollmer. And they have also interviewed Tartariatards who are closely linked to flat earthers, like Andreas Xirtus and Max Igan.

Alfa Vedic is named after the <span class=quote>&quot;Alfa Vedic Gardens&quot;</span> which were established by Barre Lando and which <span class=quote>&quot;conformed to both Steiner Biodynamics and Permaculture principles&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.alfavedic.com/about-alfa-vedic/>https://www.alfavedic.com/about-alfa-vedic/</a>]</span> So Lando is a Steinerian just like Tom Cowan and Ralph White. One section on Alfa Vedic's about us page is about <span class=quote>&quot;Spagyric Alchemy&quot;</span>, and in an interview that Barre Lando did with David Weiss, he said: <span class=quote>&quot;I have a my alchemical lab out there. And so what I like to do is step back and really look at again those larger patterns, and you know Hermetic principles have always been my guiding light.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jduiNnyyPIA&amp;t=8m9s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jduiNnyyPIA&amp;t=8m9s</a>]</span> Amandha Vollmer's LinkedIn also says that her job position is <span class=quote>&quot;Alchemist&quot;</span>.

The fourth-oldest interview listed on Lester and Parker's website was an interview they did on the <span class=quote>&quot;Alchemy&quot;</span> podcast of John Gibbons. Their guests have included flat earthers like David Weiss, Crrow777, and Mark Devlin. For some reason there seems to be a lot of overlap between flat earthers and people who call themselves alchemists. James True and Crrow777 frequently discuss alchemy on their podcasts, and the flat earthers Amandha Vollmer and Benjamin Balderson call themselves alchemists.

A bio of Kelly Brogan says that she <span class=quote>&quot;is a soul alchemist and threshold guardian devoted to the transformation of collective consciousness.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.kellybroganmd.com/audacious-embodiment>https://www.kellybroganmd.com/audacious-embodiment</a>]</span> On her website, Kelly Brogan offers a private coaching package called <span class=quote>&quot;40-Day Alchemical Container&quot;</span>, which only costs 22,000 USD. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.kellybroganmd.com/private-coaching-kelly>https://www.kellybroganmd.com/private-coaching-kelly</a>]</span>

One of the products sold by Tom Cowan is Polyrhachis Ant Spagyric Tincture, which is <span class=quote>&quot;made from a specific type of ant, the Changbai Mountain Ant, then made into a spagyric or alchemically based tincture&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/these-ancient-medicines-are-universal-tonics>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/these-ancient-medicines-are-universal-tonics</a>]</span> And another product sold by Cowan is a <span class=quote>&quot;Spagyric Strophanthus tincture made by master alchemist Phoenix Aurelius, the same person who makes our Liposomal Vitamin C&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/new-strophanthus-spagyric-tincture-now-available>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/new-strophanthus-spagyric-tincture-now-available</a>]</span>

Andrew Kaufman offers an <span class=quote>&quot;Alchemical Detox Course&quot;</span>, where <span class=quote>&quot;you will be invited to participate in a special webinar called Alchemical Transformation, where you will be able to go over your questions and work on your detox plan with Dr. Kaufman&quot;</span>, and where Kaufman <span class=quote>&quot;will teach you how the alchemical principles and steps will apply to your healing process and introduce you to Spagyric Medicine&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/the-alchemical-detox/>https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/the-alchemical-detox/</a>]</span>

The guests on Alec Zeck's podcast have included Devon Graham who is <span class=quote>&quot;the pioneer of Alchemy Breathwork&quot;</span>, Aubert Bastiat who <span class=quote>&quot;is devoted to anchoring the remembrance of who we are as children of God in the emergent paradigm through the necessary work of Masculine Alchemy and the dance and play of Sacred Union&quot;</span>, and Xavier Dagba who <span class=quote>&quot;loves to think of himself as an emotional alchemist&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-way-forward-podcast/id1532600628>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-way-forward-podcast/id1532600628</a>, <a href=https://www.deezer.com/en/show/2070422>https://www.deezer.com/en/show/2070422</a>]</span>

In one podcast Sofia Smallstorm discussed <span class=quote>&quot;golems, dybbuks, the concealed project of alchemy, the Nanotech Pyramid, novel microorganisms, Clifford Carnicom, morgellons, the Holy Grail, and the importance of self work&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://themeltpodcast.net/podcast/sofia-smallstorm-dybbuks-alchemy-and-the-holy-grail/>https://themeltpodcast.net/podcast/sofia-smallstorm-dybbuks-alchemy-and-the-holy-grail/</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; Unbeknownst to most Masons, many of the symbols found in symbolic, or <span class=quote>&quot;Blue Lodge&quot;</span> Masonry came to us from Alchemy. In his book, <span class=quote>&quot;Symbolism of the Blue Degrees of Freemasonry&quot;</span><span class=paren>[4]</span>, Albert Pike describes these relationships and states that <span class=quote>&quot;By this and many other proofs we know that the symbols of Freemasonry were introduced into it by the Hermetic philosophers of England...&quot;</span><span class=paren>[5]</span>. Manly P.

<h2><a href=#David_Martin_and_Sacha_Stone name=David_Martin_and_Sacha_Stone>##</a> David Martin and Sacha Stone</h2>
In an interview with Alec Zeck in July 2023, David Martin said that viruses are not real, nucleotides are not real, DNA is not real, and atoms are not real. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936>https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936</a>, <a href=https://expose-news.com/2023/08/10/there-was-no-sars-cov2-disease-just-a-set-of-symptoms-and-a-branding-campaign-dr-david-martin/>https://expose-news.com/2023/08/10/there-was-no-sars-cov2-disease-just-a-set-of-symptoms-and-a-branding-campaign-dr-david-martin/</a>]</span> Alec Zeck said: <span class=quote>&quot;So just to be clear here, so when we're talking about a virus - I'm not talking about the previous definition of poison, I'm talking about a tiny replication-competent obligate intracellular parasite consisting of a genome surrounded by a protein coat that is an infectious particle.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[39:50]</span> And Martin told him: <span class=quote>&quot;All bullshit, 100% bullshit.&quot;</span> Next David Martin said: <span class=quote>&quot;DNA does not exist.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[42:41]</span> Then Alec Zeck replied: <span class=quote>&quot;I don't disagree with that.&quot;</span> And Martin said: <span class=quote>&quot;It doesn't.&quot;</span> David Martin also said: <span class=quote>&quot;There are no atoms, there never have been, and there never will be.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[44:52]</span> And next he said: <span class=quote>&quot;The model of an atom then gives rise to the model of a thing we call a nucleic acid. Now, nucleic acids do not exist.&quot;</span>

One way to gauge whether some person in alt media is genuine or not is to look at which alternative media outlets they did their earliest interviews with. If it's the Stew Peters Show like in the case of Sasha Latypova then they're probably phony. David Martin had appeared on several mainstream news outlets for years before COVID, but he did many of his first appearances on alt media with Sacha Stone. When I searched BitChute for the oldest videos about David Martin, the two oldest results were videos mirrored from his own YouTube channel, but the third-oldest video was about his presentation for Sacha Stone's <span class=quote>&quot;International Tribunal for Natural Justice&quot;</span> and the fourth-oldest video was an interview he did with Sacha Stone. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=%22david%20martin%22&amp;kind=video&amp;sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=%22david%20martin%22&amp;kind=video&amp;sort=old</a>]</span> David Martin's <span class=quote>&quot;Fauci/COVID-19 Dossier&quot;</span> says: <span class=quote>&quot;This work was supported, in part, by a fund-raising effort in which approximately 330 persons contributed funds in support of the New Earth technology team and Urban Global Health Alliance.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.co.yamhill.or.us/sites/default/files/BOC%20Public%20Comments%20052021.pdf>https://www.co.yamhill.or.us/sites/default/files/BOC%20Public%20Comments%20052021.pdf</a>]</span> The description of an episode of Sacha Stone's NewEarth Horizon podcast said: <span class=quote>&quot;Support Dr. David Martin and NewEarth Media's Might Cause:  www.lineinthesand.us/discovery  to stay in contact: www.focusonfauci.com&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://podcast.app/dr-david-martin-freedom-rally-dc-listing-felony-crimes-e126022364/>https://podcast.app/dr-david-martin-freedom-rally-dc-listing-felony-crimes-e126022364/</a>]</span> In January 2021 Sacha Stone's organization NewEarth Media organized an event called <span class=quote>&quot;Focus on Fauci&quot;</span> where the speakers consisted of Judy Mikovits, David Martin, Robert F.

Robert David Steele's bio said that he was <span class=quote>&quot;Co-Founder of the Information Warfare Conference, founder of the Open Source Solutions Conference, invited lecturer worldwide on topics of Cyber, Open Source Intelligence <span class=paren>(OSINT)</span>, <span class=paren>(All-Source)</span> Intelligence Reform, and Applied Collective Intelligence inclusive of holistic analytics, true cost economics, and Open Source Everything Engineering <span class=paren>(OSEE)</span> focused on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals <span class=paren>(SDG)</span>.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://robertdavidsteele.com/about/>https://robertdavidsteele.com/about/</a>]</span> So the primary aims of his Open Source Everything Engineering initiative was to achieve the sustainable development goals.

IREO is listed on the UN's website as a former participant in the UN's Global Compact initiative, which includes over 20,000 companies and organizations that have committed to follow sustainable principles. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/11530-Intergovernmental-Renewable-Energy-Organization>https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/11530-Intergovernmental-Renewable-Energy-Organization</a>]</span> But IREO may have been accepted as a member of the initiative simply based on a short letter where IREO's founder stated that IREO followed the principles of the Global Compact. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/commitment_letters/11530/original/UN_Global_COmpact_IREO.pdf>https://ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/commitment_letters/11530/original/UN_Global_COmpact_IREO.pdf</a>]</span> When I googled for <span class=code>`site:un.org "Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Organization"`</span>, I didn't find any document that indicated that IREO was affiliated with the UN, but I only found documents which said that two NGOs had participated in a conference that was held by IREO, and I found a document where an ambassador of Hondruas requested the UN General Assembly to grant observer status to IREO. But the observer status was not granted, because the UN General Assembly currently includes only about 100 intergovernmental organizations with observer status. Honduras was one of 5 countries that had signed IREO's treaty, along with Afganistan, Grenada, Kenya, and Zambia. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601012434/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=treaty>https://web.archive.org/web/20100601012434/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=treaty</a>]</span> A snapshot of IREO's website from 2010 listed 27 people affiliated with the organization, who included <span class=quote>&quot;Director-General of Europe&quot;</span> Sacha Stone and <span class=quote>&quot;Chairperson of the Economic Innovations Committee&quot;</span> David Martin. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20100601012359/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=team&amp;ref=sec>http://web.archive.org/web/20100601012359/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=team&amp;ref=sec</a>]</span> In 2010 when Sacha Stone's Humanitad Foundation and IREO jointly launched an <span class=quote>&quot;Exemplar Zero Initiative&quot;</span>, David Martin hosted an event in New York which celebrated the initiative. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://hauteliving.com/2010/10/zampolli%E2%80%99s-world-exemplar-zero-initiative-ceremony/94831/>https://hauteliving.com/2010/10/zampolli%E2%80%99s-world-exemplar-zero-initiative-ceremony/94831/</a>, <a href=https://www.m-cam.com/2010/10/10/exemplar-zero-initiative-launched-in-new-york/>https://www.m-cam.com/2010/10/10/exemplar-zero-initiative-launched-in-new-york/</a>]</span> IREO seems to have become inactive after their founder Robson Mello died in 2012.

In the years 2008-2010, Sacha Stone served as the <span class=quote>&quot;executive producer&quot;</span> of an annual event called the United Nations Millennium Development Goal Awards. It's unclear to what extent the event was affiliated with the UN, but I did find press releases about the event on the UN's website, and the event was held in the large hall where normally the UN parliament meets. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aun.org+%22Millennium+Development+Goals+Awards%22>https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aun.org+%22Millennium+Development+Goals+Awards%22</a>, <a href=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/2009-mdg-awards-presentation/2779323#11>https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/2009-mdg-awards-presentation/2779323#11</a>]</span>

Between April and June 2020, ITNJ published a series of seven <span class=quote>&quot;Corona Emergency Hearing&quot;</span> videos, where the star of the 4th hearing was Judy Mikovits and the star of the 5th hearing was David Martin. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://commission.itnj.org/category/emergency-hearings/>https://commission.itnj.org/category/emergency-hearings/</a>]</span> A bit later Mikovits became the star of the first Plandemic film and David Martin became the star of the second Plandemic film.

David Martin was the main star of the Plandemic 2 film by Mikki Willis.

When Mikki made the first Plandemic film that starred Judy Mikovits, he hired his friend Zach Vorhies to book interviews for Mikovits and to write tweets under her name. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423204807/https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-amplify-pharma-whistleblower-judy-mikovits>http://web.archive.org/web/20200423204807/https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-amplify-pharma-whistleblower-judy-mikovits</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6awM9bZm2e4>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6awM9bZm2e4</a>]</span> In a tweet in 2019 where Zach Vorhies tagged his friends, he tagged a bunch of Qtards along with Mikki Willis. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/Perpetualmaniac/status/1184845479365885952>https://x.com/Perpetualmaniac/status/1184845479365885952</a>]</span> The page for Vorhies at mylife.com has now been changed, but it used to say that <span class=quote>&quot;Zachary's ethnicity is Caucasian Jew, whose political affiliation is currently a registered Classical Liberal Larper; and religious views are listed as Christian Larper.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423031655/https://www.mylife.com/zachary-vorhies/e910516938912>http://web.archive.org/web/20200423031655/https://www.mylife.com/zachary-vorhies/e910516938912</a>]</span> In 2019 Zach Vorhies became a whistleblower at Project Veritas who leaked documents about how Google discriminated against conservatives.

In 2022 Jane Ruby organized an event called <span class=quote>&quot;Pharmaceutical Insider Expose&quot;</span> at Palm Beach where the speakers consisted of David Martin, Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, and Mike Yeadon. <span class=paren>[<a href=pfizerstew.html>pfizerstew.html</a>]</span> In late 2022, Latypova, Kingston, and Yeadon all started to promote a similar no-virus-lite theory as J.J. Couey, where they claimed that COVID was not caused by a virus, that viruses are not capable of causing pandemics, and that gain-of-function research is not actually that dangerous. Yeadon was the vice president and chief scientific officer of Pfizer's division for respiratory and allergy research, and afterwards he founded a company called Ziarco together with other former Pfizer employees, and his company was financed by Pfizer which received the commercial rights to their portfolio of assets. Karen Kingston has said that she used to be a <span class=quote>&quot;top-performing cardiovascular specialty representative with Pfizer&quot;</span> and that afterwards Pfizer was one of the clients of her consulting firm. Latypova was a co-founder of iCardiac Technologies which did a multimillion-dollar deal with Pfizer in 2007, and before it she worked for VirtualScopics whose lead client used to be Pfizer. David Martin was the president of Mosaic Tech which worked in clinical trial design, and Latypova's company iCardiac also conducted clinical trials. As far as I know, Latypova did her alt media debut in January 2022 on the Stew Peters Show, and she has been promoting Stew ops about hydrogel and about self-assembling structures found in COVID jabs. Karen Kingston did her alt media debut in July 2021 on the Doug Billings Show, which is aired on a cable TV channel which also airs the Stew Peters Show, and two weeks later she appeared on the Stew Peters Show. Kingston has said that COVID vaccines contain hydras, snake venom, graphene oxide, hydrogel, and self-assembling nanotechnology.

When people were saying that the logo of Martin's company M-CAM looks like a Masonic compass placed in front of a Masonic apron, Martin published a Facebook post where he denied that his logo had Masonic influences, but he wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;While my grandfather and great grandfather were both Masons, our logo has no similarity to those symbols.

David Martin said that he had a role in the investigation of the 1995 Tokio subway sarin attacks: <span class=quote>&quot;There's no question that the Tokyo subway bombing - which was something that I had the privilege of being part of the investigation team on - there's no question in my mind that somebody got into the air ducts in the Tokyo subway system and murdered people with an aerosolized agent, and there's no question that the aerosolized agent was derived from a natural substance.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936>https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936</a>, 1:08:58]</span> Since the subway attacks were likely a false flag, the people who were selected to investigate the crime may have been working for the perpetrators, like was the case with the 9/11 Commission.

David Martin's blog is called <span class=quote>&quot;Inverted Alchemy&quot;</span>, which is interesting considering how many of the no-virus guys call themselves alchemists, or they sell alchemical tinctures in their online store, or they offer expensive online courses where they teach people about alchemy.

<h2><a href=#David_Steele name=David_Steele>##</a>  David Steele</h2>
I'm not sure if Robert David Steele claimed that viruses in general don't exist, but he was one of the first people who started to say that the pandemic was fake and that COVID was caused by 5G, and he was the first person I found who connected COVID to Arthur Firstenberg's book <span class=quote>_Invisible Rainbow_</span>.

When I investigated the origins of the theory that COVID was caused by 5G, the earliest video or article about the theory I found was a video by Mark Steele from January 28th in an unknown timezone. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=5g+coronavirus+until:2020-01-29+lang:en&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=5g+coronavirus+until:2020-01-29+lang:en&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://wickedtruths.org/en/video-list-5g-microwave-weapons-microwave-radiation-poisoining/>https://wickedtruths.org/en/video-list-5g-microwave-weapons-microwave-radiation-poisoining/</a>]</span> Next the theory was mentioned on January 29th in an unknown timezone by Richie from Boston and in a report that Greg Reese did for InfoWars. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://altcensored.com/watch?v=R7oMkWPvz10>https://altcensored.com/watch?v=R7oMkWPvz10</a>, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200131123524/https://www.infowars.com/5g-launches-in-wuhan-weeks-before-coronavirus-outbreak/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200131123524/https://www.infowars.com/5g-launches-in-wuhan-weeks-before-coronavirus-outbreak/</a>]</span> RDS had mentioned the theory by January 30th UTC. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/flyer4life/status/1222761722630561793>https://x.com/flyer4life/status/1222761722630561793</a>]</span> Next on February 3rd UTC, RDS did a video about the theory with Sacha Stone and Mark Steele, and on February 3rd UTC Max Igan also posted a video about the theory. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/nBdVf-8W9yc/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/nBdVf-8W9yc/</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/nBdVf-8W9yc/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/nBdVf-8W9yc/</a>]</span>

Some time in late January 2020, Robert David Steele published a long blog post about the theory that 5G causes COVID. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/>https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/</a>]</span> The blog post is now dated February 8th, but a tweet from January 30th 2020 UTC linked to the same post and said: <span class=quote>&quot;Robert Steele: China Coronavirus -- UPDATE: BioWar, Bats, 5G <a href=https://phibetaiota.net/2020/01/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/>https://phibetaiota.net/2020/01/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/</a> via @phibiblog&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/flyer4life/status/1222761722630561793>https://x.com/flyer4life/status/1222761722630561793</a>]</span> However I didn't find the version from January 30th archived anywhere.

On February 12th the Tehran Times published an interview with RDS where he said that COVID was caused by 5G, and he promoted Sacha Stone's fake 5GBioShield product. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-in-tehran-times-interview-a-counterintelligence-perspective-on-the-wuhan-virus-a-zionist-bio-war-false-flag-attack/>https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-in-tehran-times-interview-a-counterintelligence-perspective-on-the-wuhan-virus-a-zionist-bio-war-false-flag-attack/</a>]</span>

On March 10th in an unknown timezone, RDS published a memorandum to Trump where he wrote the following: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://phibetaiota.net/2020/03/robert-steele-memorandum-for-the-president-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5g-new-biowar-attacks-need-for-counterintelligence-study/>https://phibetaiota.net/2020/03/robert-steele-memorandum-for-the-president-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5g-new-biowar-attacks-need-for-counterintelligence-study/</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; This appears to have started as a combination of a Zionist-German-French-Gladio biological <span class=quote>&quot;drop&quot;</span> across Wuhan beginning around 9 September 2019 when Angela Merkel first visited Wuhan; a <span class=quote>&quot;cover story&quot;</span> built up around the hapless Jewish American professor at Harvard - the Lee Harvey Oswald in what is in effect China's JFK/9-11/Chernobyl/Fukushima combined; the 5G aspect that you are being lied to about to this date; and a contrived media information war intended to wreck the Chinese, US, and global economies - and your re-election - for both insider profit taking and Deep State advantage over you. The Wuhan lab is the pre-planned <span class=quote>&quot;culprit&quot;</span>.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; Subsequently anomalous numbers in Iran confirm the contrived nature of this attack; the mis-diagnosed cases around the world generally coincide with 5G networks that have at a minimum lowered immunity and at worst been used to create biological diseases. The lack of fatalities is today's good news.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; 2. New Threat. Evidence is emerging that new biological drops are taking place, possibly using nano-technology such as micro-UAVs; and that 5G is being leveraged to continue to create many cases of radiation sickness being mis-diagnosed as coronavirus.</span>

On March 19th UTC, RDS published a BitChute video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Sacha Stone Heard from God -- Here's What She Said About the Virus&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Bmg1cwxar_M/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Bmg1cwxar_M/</a>]</span> At the time Sacha Stone did not yet say that SARS-CoV-2 does not exist, but he said that the virus was innocuous and that COVID may have been caused by 5G, or that people may have been placing canisters of bacteria to strategic locations around cities which produced a temporary outbreak of disease. And he said: <span class=quote>&quot;So deep state detox, under the smokescreen of an engineered somewhat innocuous virus - which by best accounts is not much worse than a household flu - that to me is a very clever way of these so-called white hats engineering a scenario which forces the world into a slow down at every level, so they can begin the process of getting paramilitary forces and SWAT teams onto the streets of towns, cities, villages all around the world and cherrypicking probably over a half a million operatives - bad actors - who need to be removed from their positions.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[3:02]</span> In March 2020 RDS also published an interview with Benjamin Fulford, who also said that the virus was no worse than the flu, but the lockdowns were engineered as a cover so the white hats could arrest the bad guys. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/t49kxpSA1_w/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/t49kxpSA1_w/</a>]</span>

On March 3rd 2020 UTC, Benjamin Fulford published a blog post which said that <span class=quote>&quot;The fake coronavirus pandemic now being promoted around the world is aimed at creating a world republic, P3 Freemason sources say.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://benjaminfulford.net/pandemic-show-aims-to-launch-world-government-project-blue-beam-next/>https://benjaminfulford.net/pandemic-show-aims-to-launch-world-government-project-blue-beam-next/</a>]</span> In the same post he quoted a post by Robert David Steele which said that <span class=quote>&quot;President Donald Trump has publicly declared the coronavirus a hoax but has been forced to backtrack by the political circus.&quot;</span>

On March 25th UTC, RDS published a BitChute video titled <span class=quote>&quot;Former Spy Tells President Trump Truth in Nine Minutes - Fake Pandemic, 5G Triggers, Purge Needed&quot;</span>. He said: <span class=quote>&quot;Now I was the first to say that this was a false pandemic. I was the first to tie in 5G which lowers immunity. And I'll come to 5G as a trigger system in a minute. But let's just look at this: that tiny little blue sliver is deaths that can actually be attributed to coronavirus. Everything else is preexisting conditions. And over here we have all of these guys that were previous fake pandemics. <span class=paren>[...]</span> Now here's the last slide - I gotta give a tip of the hat to American Intelligence Media - you can find these two slides at TinyURL, and of course the original American Intelligence Media article. Here's what it boils down to. The coronavirus - a bioengineered virus - contains nanoparticles that can be activated on a time-phased arrangement by 5G, ok. Which means that this whole thing could be phased out, and every time we think we have a grip on it: boom, another spurt comes up and induces fear.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/giiDPiEioe0/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/giiDPiEioe0/</a>, 5:33]</span> The article by American Intelligence Media is historically important as part of the origin of the theory that COVID was caused by nanotechnology. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://aim4truth.org/2020/03/22/cat-report-340/>https://aim4truth.org/2020/03/22/cat-report-340/</a>]</span> Douglas Gabriel and John Barnwell from American Intelligence Media are anthroposophists who have started a movement called <span class=quote>&quot;neoanthroposophy&quot;</span>, which is interesting because Tom Cowan is also an anthroposophist.

Douglas Gabriel published an article where he wrote about how Blavatsky said that Jesuits were trying to infiltrate anthroposophy, and then he wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;I was also a Freemason and by firsthand experience know its link to the Society of Jesus <span class=paren>(Jesuits)</span>.

In an interview with Benjamin Fulford published on March 27th UTC, Robert David Steele said: <span class=quote>&quot;There's also a lot of fakery then.

He may have in fact started the trend where people were filming empty hospitals in order to show that the pandemic was fake, because he started posting videos from empty hospitals on March 16th but I didn't find earlier videos from empty hospitals by anyone else, and he also tweeted that <span class=quote>&quot;I think I may have visited more hospitals than anyone else, at least that I'm aware of&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://sars2.net/yt.html#Jason_Goodman_may_have_started_the_trend_of_filming_empty_hospitals>https://sars2.net/yt.html#Jason_Goodman_may_have_started_the_trend_of_filming_empty_hospitals</a>, <a href=https://x.com/csthetruth/status/1244399390086889474>https://x.com/csthetruth/status/1244399390086889474</a>]</span> The <span class=quote>&quot;#filmyourhospital&quot;</span> hashtag was started on March 29th UTC by DeAnna Lorraine, who now has a show on the Stew Peters Network. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%23filmyourhospital%20until%3A2020-3-30>https://x.com/search?q=%23filmyourhospital%20until%3A2020-3-30</a>]</span> When RDS sued Jason Goodman for 24 million USD for defamation, he was represented by Steven Biss, who also represented Malone when Malone sued the Breggins and Jane Ruby for 25 million USD for defamation.

Jason Goodman even interviewed Colleen Smith over the phone. So when RDS said that COVID was a medical simulation, he probably referred to Colleen Smith's video. My theory is that the Colleen Smith video may have been a psyop whose purpose was to trick conspiratards into thinking that the pandemic was fake, so that it may have been part of the plan that people would end up discovering that she was an expert in medical simulation. But anyway, next during the interview with RDS, Sacha Stone said that <span class=quote>&quot;a virus is an excretion from living cells that happens as a detoxification phenomenon&quot;</span>, and he talked about the <span class=quote>_Invisible Rainbow_</span> book and he said that COVID was caused by 5G, and then RDS said that he had a 17-page summary of the book on his website. Tom Cowan also published a review of the <span class=quote>_Invisible Rainbow_</span> book on his blog in December 2019, where he wrote that <span class=quote>&quot;during the coming weeks and months, I will share revelations I gained from reading this masterpiece&quot;</span>, so I don't know if he was already coached on what he should start talking about in 2020. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/a-big-change-in-emfs-preceded-each-pandemic>https://drtomcowan.com/blogs/blog/a-big-change-in-emfs-preceded-each-pandemic</a>]</span> During the same interview with RDS, Sacha Stone also said that social distancing causes AIDS: <span class=quote>&quot;So if you are trying to turn people to cloister indoors and stay out of sunshine, and stop hugging their grandchildren, and stay three meters away from each other, you just f***ed up in an unholy way.

Robert David Steele's blog had a long article about COVID which was originally dated Feburary 7th 2020 but which was later edited many times, and its title was later changed to <span class=quote>&quot;Robert Steele: FAKE PANDEMIC It's OVER! <span class=paren>[President is Correct - This is the New Hoax aka False Flag.]</span>&quot;</span>. The oldest version of the article may not have yet said that the pandemic was fake, but the oldest snapshot of the article at web.archive.org is from February 27th UTC and it already said that <span class=quote>&quot;there is no virus threat&quot;</span> and that <span class=quote>&quot;they know this is all fake, no vaccine for radiation sickness&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200227153055/https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200227153055/https://phibetaiota.net/2020/02/robert-steele-china-coronavirus-my-appraisal/</a>]</span>

In a book titled <span class=quote>&quot;The Handbook of Fifth-Generation Warfare&quot;</span>, there is a timeline which describes the origins of the term <span class=quote>&quot;fifth-generation warfare&quot;</span>, but the very first entry on the timeline is the following: <span class=quote>&quot;August 29, 2003: An apparent press release from OSS.net, through PRNewswire, in Windows .doc format, detailing need for fifth-generation tactics to create <span class=quote>'the necessary new national security paradigm,'</span> as described by Robert David Steele <span class=paren>(Steele 2003)</span>.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://dokumen.pub/the-handbook-of-fifth-generation-warfare-9781934840177-1934840173.html>https://dokumen.pub/the-handbook-of-fifth-generation-warfare-9781934840177-1934840173.html</a>]</span> So RDS might possibly deserve the credit for coining the term fifth-generation warfare.

Robert David Steele is supposed to have died of COVID in August 2021 <span class=paren>(even though he is one of the last people I would trust to not have faked their own death)</span>. But anyway, 12 days earlier he posted a blog post where he wrote: <span class=paren>[<a href=https://phibetaiota.net/2021/08/roberts-condition-08-17-2021/>https://phibetaiota.net/2021/08/roberts-condition-08-17-2021/</a>]</span>

<span class=quote>&gt; With love to all of you, I survived! I went in at 77 oxygenation. I'm up to 94. I will not take the vaccination, though I did test positive for whatever they're calling <span class=quote>&quot;COVID&quot;</span> today, but the bottom line is that my lungs are not functioning.</span>
<span class=quote>&gt; The good news is that I will survive with a few days off. I should be back up and at least functional soon. This is been a near death experience, very much like a new death experience the whole country is going through right now. We will never be the same because now we know that we've all been lied to about everything. But, now we also know that we can trust each other. I'm alive today because I had a network that put me into a good hospital in Florida.</span>

Robert David Steele said that he was a <span class=quote>&quot;ghost-writer for the Commandant of the Marine Corps, then General Al Gray&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125221420/http://www.northatlanticbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AUTHOR_BIO_OpenSourceEverythingManifesto.pdf>https://web.archive.org/web/20161125221420/http://www.northatlanticbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AUTHOR_BIO_OpenSourceEverythingManifesto.pdf</a>]</span> RDS said he was the ghostwriter of a paper from 1989 credited to Al Gray. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202023437/https://phibetaiota.net/1989/07/general-al-gray-on-global-intelligence-challenges-1989/>https://web.archive.org/web/20210202023437/https://phibetaiota.net/1989/07/general-al-gray-on-global-intelligence-challenges-1989/</a>]</span> Kay Griggs said that her husband was the chief of staff for Al Gray: <span class=quote>&quot;George was the Chief of Staff for the Marine Corps, for <span class=quote>'Gray's Boys,'</span> the assassins, who were working with General Steiner, General Jim Joy, and General Grup Krulak and they were working for the Nelson Rockefeller group in the Republican Party.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://avalonlibrary.net/Kay_Griggs_interviews/Kay_Griggs_interview_notes.pdf>https://avalonlibrary.net/Kay_Griggs_interviews/Kay_Griggs_interview_notes.pdf</a>]</span> She also said this about Al Gray: <span class=quote>&quot;I know they called him <span class=quote>'the Commissar.'</span> He was the one who did all of the training. They had a halo school in the Philippines where they trained the Delta Force, the assassins in the Philippines. The Australians also had one on an island in East Timor. It's in the mountains. And the Portuguese are involved in this.&quot;</span> She also said this about Gray: <span class=quote>&quot;He was running everything in Vietnam. They were training boys to kill using mind control. This is why the Army has so many special operations specialists.&quot;</span> And she said this about her husband: <span class=quote>&quot;He's working under Al Gray, called <span class=quote>'Gray's boys.'</span> This is what they call them. Gray's boys are all homosexuals. Cherry marines. There are books on cherry marines that I've got.

<h2><a href=#Twitter_user_ferryman name=Twitter_user_ferryman>##</a> Twitter user ferryman</h2>
The Twitter user conspirator0 is probably the leading expert in researching bots and inauthentic accounts on Twitter. He posted a thread about the earliest accounts that started tweeting about flat earth, where he wrote: <span class=quote>&quot;How did the surge in #FlatEarth traffic begin? @ferryman and @Jayson4mind appear to be the first accounts to have pushed on-topic #FlatEarth tweets, in the form of spammy links to YouTube videos.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1110349151802408960>https://x.com/conspirator0/status/1110349151802408960</a>]</span> He pointed out that ferryman's first tweet about flat earth was posted in April 2015, and it linked to a YouTube video by Mark Sargent from February 2015. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/ferryman/status/583666715336306688>https://x.com/ferryman/status/583666715336306688</a>]</span>

When I searched Twitter for <span class=code>`from:ferryman virus`</span>, I found that ferryman had posted a tweet in 2018 which said this in Dutch: <span class=quote>&quot;I know this for sure because I have already discovered many lies of science. Atom has never been proven, virus never proven, evolution impossible, big bang impossible, moon landing 1 and all fake. Mars ditto. HIV nonsense. AIDS also lie. Etc etc&quot;</span>. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aferryman%20virus&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aferryman%20virus&amp;f=live</a>]</span> He also posted a tweet in 2018 that said in Dutch: <span class=quote>&quot;Virus -free island? Haha. It has never been proven <span class=paren>(except on the computer)</span> that viruses exist. #Newshour&quot;</span>.

Since it's a popular theme among flat earthers to question various fields of science, it's not that surprising that flat earthers would've already questioned virology before 2020. For example in November 2019, the flat earth channel <span class=quote>&quot;Flat Water FE&quot;</span> posted a video where Stefan Lanka said that viruses are not real, and the video was also mirrored by the flat earth channel <span class=quote>&quot;Francis Judge II&quot;</span>, even though both videos have now been deleted. <span class=paren>[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200327141237/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0uemkf9c88>http://web.archive.org/web/20200327141237/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0uemkf9c88</a>]</span>

These days there are many people who genuinely believe in flat earth and who genuinely believe that viruses do not exist, but in the first half of 2015 the movement had not yet gained a very large following of useful idiots, so a high percentage of people who posted about flat earth online were probably deliberately promoting false information. So it's suspicious that ferryman was one of the first Twitter users who started posting about flat earth, and that before COVID he was already saying that viruses do not exist.

I tried to find the earliest sources where various flat earthers said that SARS-CoV-2 is not real, or that SARS-CoV-2 is akin to soap that is produced by the human body, or where flat earthers started to promote the no-virus theory in relation to COVID <span class=paren>(even though some flat earthers like Sofia Smallstorm already promoted the theory before COVID)</span>.

Most dates on the list below are in UTC but some dates are in an unspecified timezone. I didn't find the original publication date for some of the videos linked below, so their date is the date when the video mentioned on some other website or mirrored to another site. Some people on the list like Max Igan might not currently be flat earthers, but at least they have at some point said that the earth is flat.

<h2><a href=#Andrew_Kaufman_is_now_a_flat_earther name=Andrew_Kaufman_is_now_a_flat_earther>##</a> Andrew Kaufman is now a flat earther</h2>
In December 2023 Andrew Kaufman was a speaker at a virtual flat earth conference called Mount Meru Summit, where he gave a presentation about the parallels between the no-virus theory and the flat earth theory. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://odysee.com/@DrAndrewKaufman:f/Fallacies_Fraud_Pseudoscience>https://odysee.com/@DrAndrewKaufman:f/Fallacies_Fraud_Pseudoscience</a>]</span>

For example he said that in the same way that proof of viruses relies on circular reasoning, proof of globe earth also relies on circular reasoning, and he said: <span class=quote>&quot;And one of the things that comes up a lot with this that is definitely uncommon between these two fields is that you can observe a set of phenomenona in nature and you can come up with a model or a hypothesis to explain it. So the simple aspect of day and night, right? Now we know that the conventional globe Earth model has to do with the rotation of the globe in relationship to the sun. And that certainly would explain the day and night phenomenon. However, there are many others, in fact, possibly an infinite set of other models that can be put in place that also would explain that phenomenon. And we're very familiar with the model of a sun that rotates around a flat plane and that basically disappears out of view because of the distance away from where you are. And that also adequately explains the day and night phenomenon. But when you stick to this circular reasoning, you feel that your explanation is the only possible solution.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[3:39]</span> He also said: <span class=quote>&quot;We also have the use of computer models. And now this is something we see across these two areas, for example composite images. So most people who have seen images of viruses don't realize that those are not actually photographs or microscope images, those are actually graphic artist creations or renderings of one type or another. And you see this also with many of the images of earth from space. And you know it's readily admitted by NASA that these are not real photographs but they're doctored by graphical artists.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[9:25]</span> He also said that in the same way that viruses cannot be observed in nature, <span class=quote>&quot;this is also true with the alleged curvature and motion of the earth, that we simply have no way to directly observe it. It's not present when we do experiments or use simple tools like magnified lenses to observe these things.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[11:30]</span> During the Q&amp;A session at the end, someone asked Kaufman when he realized that the earth wasn't a sphere, but he answered: <span class=quote>&quot;It was the line of sight experiments that really pushed me over the edge. I mean, once I saw that and knew it was true and understood it, I really, you know, didn't need anything further.&quot;</span> <span class=paren>[57:54]</span>

Out of the other speakers at the event, at least David Weiss, Amandha Vollmer, and Kelly Brogan have said both that the earth is flat and that viruses are not real. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://trueearther.com/>https://trueearther.com/</a>]</span> Another speaker was Mike Winner, who was one of the main organizers of a virtual no-virus conference called End of COVID, but I don't know if he's a flat earther.

The dorky-looking piano guy Foundring performed music at the event, but he is also a no-virus guy. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Afoundring1+virus&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Afoundring1+virus&amp;f=live</a>]</span> Foundring made a video called Crater Earth, where he claimed that the earth is a hollow crater located on a vast landmass which also includes other planets, and where Mars is located in another crater about one million kilometers from Earth, and there are also craters that are arranged in the shape of Disneyland parks like EPCOT. The video is so ridiculous I thought it was a parody, but Foundring seems to take the video seriously himself. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Afoundring1+crater+earth&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Afoundring1+crater+earth&amp;f=live</a>]</span> He says that he is not a flat earther, but his crater earth theory is probably even dumber than flat earth.

Another speaker at Mount Meru Summit was the health guru David <span class=quote>&quot;Avocado&quot;</span> Wolfe, who has been a flat earther since 2015, but I'm not sure if he says that viruses are not real. However his Twitter account seems to be artificially amplified by bots, and I have found good evidence that his Twitter account might be either a bot or a human-bot hybrid. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://sars2.net/bot2.html#David_Avocado_Wolfe>https://sars2.net/bot2.html#David_Avocado_Wolfe</a>]</span> About once per day, his account tweets some random question like <span class=quote>&quot;If you could telepathically say something that all 7.8 Billion people on earth could hear at once what would it be?&quot;</span> But usually identical questions have been tweeted earlier by several bot accounts. <span class=paren>[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22If+you+could+telepathically+say+something+that+all%22+until%3A2024-3-28&amp;f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22If+you+could+telepathically+say+something+that+all%22+until%3A2024-3-28&amp;f=live</a>]</span>
