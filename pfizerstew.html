theories of Sasha Latypova, Mike Yeadon, and Karen Kingston</a>
</h2>
<p>Around November 2022, J.J. Couey started to say that RNA viruses
cannot cause pandemics, that COVID was caused by localized releases of
cDNA clones, and that the laboratory origin of the virus is a
distraction and that gain-of-function research is not very dangerous.
And Couey also started streaming videos by no-virus people like Andrew
Kaufman, and he started saying that the no-virus people are right in a
lot of ways but that he wanted to create a more nuanced version of their
theory. Around the same time in late 2022, Mike Yeadon, Sasha Latypova,
and Karen Kingston all started to promote a similar story that COVID was
not caused by a virus, that viruses are not capable of causing
pandemics, and that gain-of-function research is not actually dangerous.
Latypova said that COVID may have been caused by a release of
aerosolized nanoparticles, or by some kind of a release of toxins.
Kingston said that COVID was caused by an aerosol release of bat
vaccines that only contained the spike protein but not the full
virus.</p>

<p>Lab Leak is baloney. I hope you can see it now as it is being
unveiled in the most unsubtle way right on cue before WHO pandemic

<p>They are trotting this earthshattering breaking story now, finally
telling you the <span class="quote">"truth"</span> (yeah, we lied a
little bit about pangolins and bats, but it was for your own good, silly
peasants!) because WHO treaty is happening now, and they need everyone
to fall in line supporting the global totalitarian biosecurity state,
where the unelected overlords will <span class="quote">"protect
you"</span> from <span class="quote">"lab leaks from enemies and rogue
scientists"</span>, by putting you in 15-minute prisons, I mean smart
cities, and murdering you with protective military prototype <span
class="quote">"vaccines"</span>.</p>
<p>If you still think lab leaks are a thing - please explain how they
can happen, when nobody can produce animal to animal infection by <span
class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> in the lab? But it can leak
and infect the whole world outside the lab! Far from the lab and
skipping areas in between! Just not inside it.</p>
<p>Please don't fall for this narrative. There are no lab leaks. There
is deliberate deployment of bio-chemical warfare agents, toxins of
various kinds, including nano-scale particles by which materials that
are not terribly harmful can become much more so. This deployment can be
done via aerosols, formulations in food, transdermal, etc. These are
deployed by the military enforcement arm of the global banking cartel,
and they do not hold allegiance to any people or nations.</p>

<p>In this brilliant
<a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1660073740>presentation</a>, JJ
Couey explains why, and what Sars Cov 2 biowarfare agent actually is - a
purified viral clone that is marginally dangerous for a short period of
time and does not spread by itself.</p>
<p>If you hear <span class="quote">"every PhD student can make a deadly
pathogen in a home lab"</span> - please do not fall for this 3-letter
agencies-inspired nonsense. While the techniques maybe available, these
<span class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> are duds that cannot and
do not spread as they get rapidly attenuated by interaction with all
living nature. To make something remotely dangerous one needs to make
and purify A LOT of biological material, which is very expensive and
requires substantial manufacturing facilities. PhD students do not have
these kind of resources. You know who does? The
Government-Military-Academia-Pharmaceutical complex that appropriates
and spends billions to <span class="quote">"keep you safe"</span> from
<span class="quote">"rogue PhD students"</span>. However, the
government-academia-pharma cartel cannot make anything that lives and
spreads by itself. They have to apply their biowarfare materials in some
other ways, such as aerosols, gels and other formulations and even then
it is only dangerous to small numbers of people and for a short period
of time. Here's Peter Daszak's
<a href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966-defuse-proposal>DEFUSE</a>
proposal to DARPA explaining how he was going to make these <span
class="quote">"novel automated aerosolization systems"</span>, <span
class="quote">"transdermal nanoparticles applications"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"edible adhesive gels"</span> and test them on bat
colonies in caves (which are probably a good model for a crowded city
during the commuter hour).</p>
<p>Pandemics do not exist in nature. Epidemics, if they do occur are
local and self-extinguishing, because that's how nature works. The evil
psychopaths cannot really make pandemics happen. They can only scare you
into believing these are possible in order to gain control over you and
establish their cherished dream - a global totalitarian biosecurity
state. Be Not Afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an audio interview in February 2023, Latypova said that COVID was
not caused by a virus: <span class="quote">"I agree with the fact that
this wasn't a virus - wasn't a respiratory virus - wasn't a pandemic.
Pandemics don't exist. Nothing can spread around the world, nothing like
by itself. It needs a lot of help. So what they have done is they have
applied in certain areas, but in combination with propaganda, they
applied some sort of toxins, they probably weren't just chemicals. You
know, that would be my first guess."</span>

<p>In a video interview in August 2022, Mike Yeadon said:
[<a href=https://genkimanquest.substack.com/p/dr-mike-yeadon-on-respiratory-viruses>https://<wbr>genkimanquest.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>dr-<wbr>mike-<wbr>yeadon-<wbr>on-<wbr>respiratory-<wbr>viruses</a>,

<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be - I'll call them the perpetrators, the people
running this global crime, it's a global crime to take over all of
humanity - what they've done is they've pretended that there was a
serious new respiratory viral health threat, this virus in Wuhan.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there never was an exaggerated - there never was any
new health threat whatsoever. Partly the beauty of this is, it can't go
wrong, there are no moving parts. There's literally, the only moving
part is the PCR test. The initial thing, an exaggerated health
threat.</p>
<p>Now, some people believe there's a new virus. But if so, it is not
any more serious than influenza, not really, because flu vanished at the
same time by sheer coincidence.</p>
<p>Personally, I have come to the conclusion, and I will credit Andrew
Cowan [sic; he combined the names of Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan] and
his colleagues, I had a really good chat with those guys early in 2020,
and it bothered me, bothered me, bothered me. I realized over time I
could no longer maintain my understanding of respiratory viruses as I
thought I knew them.</p>
<p>And then I learned a new bit of information recently and it was just,
it collapsed the possibility that respiratory viruses as described exist
at all. They don't.</p>
<p>People do get ill, people are ill, and people have exactly the same
illnesses - Peter, and your listeners - exactly the same illnesses as
before that horrible Yeadon said viruses don't exist. They still have
quote <span class="quote">"colds"</span>, they still have quote <span
class="quote">"flu"</span>. I think we don't know what causes them and
they're not respiratory viruses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2022, Karen Kingston wrote that Stew Peters asked her to
explain what happened in Wuhan, and as a result she issued a statement
on the Stew Peters Show where she said the following:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221216072116/https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/what-happened-in-wuhan-75-billion>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20221216072116/<wbr>https://<wbr>karenkingston.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>what-<wbr>happened-<wbr>in-<wbr>wuhan-<wbr>75-<wbr>billion</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Residents of Wuhan and other cities of China, Italy and the United
States, were victims of a coordinated nanoparticle bioweapon attack, a
bioweapon attack using the same nanoparticles that are in all COVID-19
mRNA vaccines. Most victims became infected with the nanoparticles via a
direct aerosol attack, surface transmission, or food and beverage
contamination.</p>
<p>US citizens should be horrified to learn that EcoHealth Alliance, the
NIH, the DOD, and other departments within our US government refer to
lipid nanoparticles (nanocarriers) as vaccine technology that can a
deliver toxin, chemical weapon, and/or weapon of biowarfare.</p>
<p>The EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA clearly identifies
nanoparticle bioweapons as spike proteins, spike protein nanoparticles
that are <span class="quote">"bat vaccines."</span> EcoHealth lays out
the plan to"'vaccinate" residents of select Chinese cities as well as US
residents with spike-protein nanoparticle bat-vaccines via aerosol
attack, surface transmission, and food and beverage contamination. The
purposes of the nanoparticle bat-vaccines are to suppress the human
immune system while turning human beings into carriers of lethal
diseases.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>COVID-19 is caused by an advanced nanoparticle bioweapon that uses
mRNA technology to strategically deteriorate and destroy cardiovascular,
neurological, immune and reproductive systems. COVID-19 is NOT caused by
a virus, gain-of-function or wild-type.</p>
<p>Lastly, the victims who were originally inoculated with the bioweapon
in 2020 were not highly-contagious, if infectious at all. The first
round of nanoparticle bioweapons did not contain mRNA codes. They were
<span class="quote">"empty rounds."</span> There were also over 200 mRNA
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020. The virus was never isolated
because multiple mRNA sequences were released.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It's important to understand that <span class="quote">"gain-of
function viruses"</span> are simply mRNA codes. mRNA is not a
biosynthetic substance itself, mRNA is a software code. SARS-CoV-2 is
not a virus, it's a software code programmed into nanoparticles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how in the article above, Kingston even wrote that SARS-CoV-2 is
not a virus. Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"The bioweapons
developed by EcoHealth, US and CCP are far worse than <span
class="quote">'GOF viruses'</span>. Military nanoparticle bioweapons
<span class="quote">'spike proteins'</span> were intentionally released
on global citizens (not a virus).Every human being has the right to know
this info."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1606065203367407616>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Kingston_<wbr>Truth/<wbr>status/<wbr>1606065203367407616</a>]
Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Why did the CIA put out the
Chinese lab leak as a cover story for COVID-19? Because COVID-19 is not
caused by a mRNA gain-of-function SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 is caused
by the lipid nanoparticle technology, an Ai bioweapon."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1613576186596294656>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Kingston_<wbr>Truth/<wbr>status/<wbr>1613576186596294656</a>]</p>
<p>Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, Jane Ruby, and Stew Peters all use
the word <span class="quote">"bioweapon"</span> to refer to COVID
vaccines. When I searched for old tweets by Stew Peters which contained
the word virus, it seemed like in the first half of 2021 he was speaking
of the virus as if it actually exists, but in the second half of 2021 he
started putting scare quotes around the word virus, and in August 2021
he linked to an article about Christine Massey's FOIA requests where he
wrote: <span class="quote">"The whole COVID <span
class="quote">'Virus'</span> thing just crumbled. Completely."</span>
And then in December 2021 after he interviewed Karen Kingston, Stew
Peters posted a large number of tweets like this where he promoted Karen
Kingston's theory:
[<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1604153555656622081>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>realstewpeters/<wbr>status/<wbr>1604153555656622081</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-stew-virus.jpg width=550>

<p>Fans of our Pfizer crew seem to be convinced that the lab leak
narrative is a distraction and that COVID was caused by a nanoparticle
attack:</p>

<img src=i/pfizerstew-karmabit.jpg width=550>

<hr />
<p>Added later: Before Latypova appeared on Stew Peters in January 2022,
she was already saying on Telegram that the virus has not been isolated:
[<a href=https://t.me/COVID1984chat/252193>https://<wbr>t.<wbr>me/<wbr>COVID1984chat/<wbr>252193</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-telegram.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>During a Twitter space in 2024, Latypova said that she and her
husband got sick at the same time and she lost her sense of smell and
taste, but she didn't need to take a COVID test because she knew it was
fake: <span class="quote">"Myself and my husband got simultaneously
sick. I never took any COVID test - cause, I just, you know, I knew it
was fake - but the symptomology was very very characteristic, the loss
of taste and smell."</span>

<hr />
<p>Added in 2025: Yeadon has now gone full no-virus, and he says that
HIV does not exist:

<p>Latypova was a co-founder of iCardiac Technologies which did a

multiple smaller pharmaceutical and medical device clients.</p>

<p>On a subreddit of the United States Army, there was a question about
what work in psyops really involves, where someone answered that they
were specialized in psychological operations and that it was <span
class="quote">"very similar to public relations and marketing with
different audiences"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rwyrfb/what_is_psyops_really/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>reddit.<wbr>com/<wbr>r/<wbr>army/<wbr>comments/<wbr>rwyrfb/<wbr>what_<wbr>is_<wbr>psyops_<wbr>really/<wbr></a>]
And another user also answered: <span class="quote">"Did Psyop for
6years now do Marketing. It's very similar just different target
audience and you're not selling Tide detergent."</span> Karen Kingston
seems to have followed the opposite career trajectory, which led her
from marketing to psyops.</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon is sometimes erroneously described as the former vice
president of Pfizer, but he was only the vice president and CSO of a
division for allergy and respiratory research at Pfizer. An article from
2012 said: <span class="quote">"Ziarco's CEO Dr Mike Yeadon was chief
scientific officer, allergy and respiratory research, during his time at
Pfizer, before the US pharma firm announced last year it would leave the
facility."</span>

In an interview of Yeadon in 2013, he was described as the former <span

Pfizer.
[<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3936>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>nature.<wbr>com/<wbr>articles/<wbr>nrd3936</a>]
An article by Yeadon from 2020 said: <span class="quote">"Dr Mike Yeadon
is the former CSO and VP, Allergy and Respiratory Research Head with
Pfizer Global R&amp;D and co-Founder of Ziarco Pharma Ltd."</span>
[<a href=https://dailysceptic.org/2020/09/20/lies-damned-lies-and-health-statistics-the-deadly-danger-of-false-positives/>https://<wbr>dailysceptic.<wbr>org/<wbr>2020/<wbr>09/<wbr>20/<wbr>lies-<wbr>damned-<wbr>lies-<wbr>and-<wbr>health-<wbr>statistics-<wbr>the-<wbr>deadly-<wbr>danger-<wbr>of-<wbr>false-<wbr>positives/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>An article about Mike Yeadon's company Ziarco said:

<blockquote>
<p>Ziarco recently announced the closing of an initial $6-million
tranche of Series A financing totalling $27 million. The round was led
by Biotechnology Value Fund L.P, with participation by Pfizer Venture
Investments.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the financing, Ziarco has entered into an agreement
with Pfizer Inc. for the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize a
portfolio of clinical, preclinical, and research anti-inflammatory and
anti-allergic assets. In return, Pfizer will receive equity as well as
certain product-based milestone and royalty payments. Ziarco will use
the proceeds of the financing to continue development of these assets
and advance proprietary research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the stories Latypova has discussed on her BitChute channel
are somehow related to Pfizer:
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/channel/7dNrFbLeGSev/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>channel/<wbr>7dNrFbLeGSev/<wbr></a>]</p>

<p>It would make sense for Pfizer to insert a bunch of people in alt
media to first say that Pfizer vaccines contain hydras, and next that
Pfizer vaccines contain snake venom, and then that Pfizer vaccines
contain self-assembling robot arms. It makes anti-vaxxers look
ridiculous, and it causes genuine criticism of the vaccines to get
buried within a sea of false information.</p>

<p>The Rumble video for Stew's interview with Latypova was titled <span
class="quote">"LIVE: Hackers Reveal DEADLY Jab Lot Numbers, HORRIFIC
Pfizer Teen Trial Data and MORE!"</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data%2d.html>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>vs59wj-<wbr>live-<wbr>hackers-<wbr>reveal-<wbr>deadly-<wbr>jab-<wbr>lot-<wbr>numbers-<wbr>horrific-<wbr>pfizer-<wbr>teen-<wbr>trial-<wbr>data%<wbr>2d.<wbr>html</a>]
The description of the video said: <span class="quote">"Recently on this
show Dr. Jane Ruby came on and gave us the remarkable information that a
huge percentage of side effects tracked in the CDC's VAERS database are
linked to just a small percentage of the vaccine batches produced by
Pfizer and Moderna. This data came from a group calling itself Team
Enigma. They're a group of independent researchers with experience in
medical R&amp;D, statistics, data analytics, and everything else you'd
need to investigate a vaccine's impact on millions of people. A lot of
Team Enigma is anonymous but thankfully one of their number has agreed
to speak publicly. Sasha Latypova joins us to discuss."</span></p>
<p>Team Enigma's analysis was based on publicly available data from
VAERS, but Stew Peters and Jane Ruby misrepresented it as data that came
from hackers. The video for Latypova's first appearance on Stew Peters
was titled <span class="quote">"LIVE: Hackers Reveal DEADLY Jab Lot
Numbers, HORRIFIC Pfizer Teen Trial Data and MORE!"</span> Stew
introduced Latypova as <span class="quote">"one of the analysts that
took this data from the hackers"</span>, but Latypova wasn't on the show
yet at that point so she couldn't correct him, and Latypova didn't claim
herself that the data came from hackers.

A few days before Latypova went on Stew's show, Jane Ruby talked about
Team Enigma on Stew's show. She said this about them: <span
class="quote">"They told me that they were informed by professional
hackers that - this is big news, nobody else has broken this - that
these professional hackers got into Pfizer and Moderna systems, and they
were able to verify the lots. Craig Paardekooper has a list of all of
the Moderna batches deployed so far. And Moderna also has a web tool -
this will probably disappear after the Stew Peters Show airs - it has a
web tool for checking the expiration dates of batches - and these
computer guys hacked Moderna's website and got the entire list of
Moderna batches, the full list of batch codes, and they did the same for
Pfizer."</span>

At the end of the segment Stew said: <span class="quote">"This is gonna
go away though. This search function is gonna go away. And thanks to
these hackers as well, and for your time investigating, being inside of
that, thank you so much Dr. Jane Ruby."</span> A few days before
Latypova went on Stew's show, a website called <span

<p>On January 8th 2022 UTC which was a day later than Latypova appeared
on Stew Peters, the Odysee channel of Füllmich's Corona Investigative
Committee published a video where Mike Yeadon did a presentation of Team
Enigma's vaccine lot variability data. One of his slides said that the
slides were prepared by Team Enigma and the filename of the slides was

In June 2022, Latypova and Yeadon were both speakers in a symposium by
Doctors for COVID Ethics which was hosted by UK Column.

Latypova only started her Substack in December 2022, but before that she
wrote a long article about Pfizer's safety testing which was first
published by Doctors for COVID Ethics, and Doctors for COVID Ethics also
published a long article by Yeadon in 2022:

<p>After Latypova's appeared on the Stew Peters Show in January 2022,
her second-oldest interview I found was done by a Dutch channel called
<span class="quote">"Medisch weekjournaal"</span> and her third-oldest
interview I found was done by J.J. Couey who used to work at Erasmus
Medical Center in Rotterdam (which George Webb says is home to one of
NATO's main bioweapon labs). And it might be a coincidence, but the main
guy in Team Enigma was Craig Paardekooper, who lives in the UK but who
is of Dutch ancestry.</p>
<p>Content by people who appear on the Stew Peters Network is often
translated to several non-English languages, just like QAnon content and
content by Miles Guo's network. The story about graphene oxide
originally came from a Spanish group called La Quinta Columna, but they
also have an Odysee channel where they post content from the Stew Peters
Network with subtitles in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian,
Russian, and Spanish:
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;laquintacolumnainternational?view=content>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>l<wbr>a<wbr>q<wbr>u<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>t<wbr>a<wbr>c<wbr>o<wbr>l<wbr>u<wbr>m<wbr>n<wbr>a<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>t<wbr>e<wbr>r<wbr>n<wbr>a<wbr>t<wbr>i<wbr>o<wbr>n<wbr>a<wbr>l<wbr>?<wbr>view=content</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-quinta-odysee.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's Twitter bots also post video clips from English-language
alt media with subtitles in various languages, and often even bots that
primarily post in Chinese randomly post videos with subtitles in
European languages. Often the same bots also post tweets in several
different languages, like how the account shown below posted tweets in
Chinese, German, French, and Spanish. For example the bot below posted a
clip of an interview of Latypova with Chinese subtitles, but the bot has
also tweeted in languages like German, Spanish, and French:
[<a href=https://x.com/369Jessica369/status/1579301325996969985>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>369Jessica369/<wbr>status/<wbr>1579301325996969985</a>]</p>

<p>(Or actually I don't know if some of the accounts are hybrids between
manually-ran accounts and bots, or they might be bots which pick some of
their tweets from a pool of human-written templates, or they might be
manually-ran accounts which post some automated tweets, but I'll refer
to them as bots for the sake of convenience.)</p>
<p>One of the Guo bots also promoted J.J. Couey's story that people who
say that the virus is a bioweapon are trying to trick you into being
afraid of the virus. The same bot posted photos from the first
anniversary of the New Federal State of China, which was held at the One
World Trade Center in New York City, and which featured Limeng Yan as
one of the speakers along with the former DIA head Mike Flynn and the
naval intelligence officers Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec:</p>

<p>Miles Guo's bots often have English names, like how the bots in the
screenshots above are named 369Jessica369 and Judy Anderson.</p>
<p>The funeral director John O'Looney was also promoted by Miles Guo's
bots:

<p>David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor are the Three Microscope
Stooges whose specialty is using an optical microscope to find
nanotechnology in COVID vaccines or human blood. All three of them have
been promoted by Sasha Latypova and all three of them have appeared on
the Stew Peters Show. The Twitter account in the screenshot below posted
a link to an interview of Shimon Yanowitz by Stew Peters, but the same
account has also posted links to news stories in random European
languages. The profile picture of the Twitter account is an emblem of
the Australian branch of Miles Guo's Himalaya Supervisory
Organization:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yanowitz-bot.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>It's interesting that Himalaya Supervisory Organization has branches
on several different continents, just like how Children's Health Defense
has a European chapter, an Australian chapter, and an African chapter.
Miles Guo's bots seem to promote content both by people associated with
CHD and people associated with the Stew Peters Network. Latypova was
also a speaker in an event in Sweden that was jointly organized by a
Swedish organization and the European chapter of CHD.
[<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/quick-faq-about-upcoming-events-in>https://<wbr>sashalatypova.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>quick-<wbr>faq-<wbr>about-<wbr>upcoming-<wbr>events-<wbr>in</a>]</p>
<p>Miles Guo's network has a bunch of translators who translate their
content to foreign languages. The CHD has a blog called <span
class="quote">"The Defender"</span> which is translated to German,
French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.
[<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defensor/?lang=es>https://<wbr>c<wbr>h<wbr>i<wbr>l<wbr>d<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>n<wbr>s<wbr>h<wbr>e<wbr>a<wbr>l<wbr>t<wbr>h<wbr>d<wbr>e<wbr>f<wbr>e<wbr>n<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>.<wbr>org/<wbr>defensor/?<wbr>lang=es</a>]
La Quinta Columna's Odysee channel posts videos with subtitles in the
same set of languages, except they sometimes also post videos with
Russian or Romanian subtitles.</p>
<p>Miles Guo's movement seems like another iteration of the formula that
Western intelligence agencies employed to create the Unification Church
and Falun Gong, because all three of them had an East Asian figurehead
based in New York, all three of them controlled media empires which
promoted Christianity and conspiracy content, and all three of them also
publish media in various Western languages in addition to East Asian
languages. Many of the East Asian people associated with Guo are
Christians, like how Dinggang Wang is called Luther because he is a
Lutheran (and Limeng Yan is also a Lutheran according to one source but
I haven't verified it). The Unification Church also had an arm called
CAUSA which operated several newspapers, publishing houses, and radio
stations in Latin America. Falun Gong runs an English-language
conspiracy video channel called Edge of Wonder TV, which has promoted a
lot of junk conspiracies like ancient aliens and QAnon. In February
2020, Guo's news site GNews published an article which said that there
was a high concentration of sulphur dioxide over Wuhan which indicated
that a massive number of bodies were being burned in Wuhan, but as one
of their sources, they cited the website of a Chinese-language radio
station called <span class="quote">"Sound of Hope"</span> which is based
in the United States and which is ran by Falun Gong.
[<a href=https://gnews.org/m/16240>https://<wbr>gnews.<wbr>org/<wbr>m/<wbr>16240</a>]
(Actually earlier on January 5th, some guy on Twitter had already
spotted the high sulphur dioxide level over Wuhan, but he said that it
came from an aluminum plant which burned petroleum coke to make anodes.

<p>(The screenshots above show that the Guo accounts post a lot of links
to Gettr, but it's probably because Guo's foundation is one of the
owners of Gettr, so many of the Guo accounts even use the logo of Gettr
as their profile picture. Most of the Guo accounts are probably bots,
but Guo's movement also includes members who are known as <span
class="quote">"ants"</span> who promote his content in a manner that is
sometimes difficult to distinguish from bots.)</p>
<p>The tweet below included a clip of a video where Bret Weinstein
talked about DRASTIC which was translated to Chinese with a watermark of
the Himalaya Supervisory Organization:

<p>Miles Guo's movement has several Discord groups where I believe
people who work as Guo's translators post clips of videos from
English-language alt media with Chinese subtitles, so the people in the
Discord groups might choose themselves which videos they end up
translating. So even if Guo's movement would be ran by western
intelligence, it doesn't necessarily mean that all of the people whose
videos they translate would also be controlled opposition.</p>
<p>In December 2022 Michael Senger was one of the first people who
started promoting JC's new Scooby Doo theory, because he wrote a long
Substack post about one of JC's streams titled <span
class="quote">"DRASTIC Founder Renounces Lab Leak Theory of COVID's
Origins"</span>. But Senger is also the author of an anti-China book
titled <span class="quote">"Snake Oil: How Xi Jinping Shut Down the
World"</span>:

Wikipedia says that Tablet Magazine is <span class="quote">"a

<p>In October 2023 when Israel was totally taken by surprise by Hamas
which they did not create and fund themselves, Michael Senger tweeted a
link to an article by Voice of America, where he quoted text that said:
<span class="quote">"Antisemitic remarks have flooded China's heavily
censored online platforms...since the Hamas attacks on Israel... Scores of
online Chinese commentators and netizens quickly rallied for Gaza after
the Hamas attacks...saying Israel deserves the bloodshed."</span>

Senger also tweeted a link to an article that was published by an
English-language newspaper based in Taiwan, where he quoted the text
<span class="quote">"China's state media accused of spreading
anti-Israel disinformation... Chinese state-run media has spread the
unverified rumor that Israeli forces are using white phosphorus bombs

And he tweeted a link to an article by Wall Street Journal which said
that China <span class="quote">"has embraced the Palestinian cause in a
way it hadn't done in decades. Its once cordial ties with Israel are in
tatters."</span>

Limeng Yan has also posted a large number of similar tweets where she
says that CCP is supporting Palestine.

<p>Karen Kingston also blames everything on the <span

<p>Karen Kingston reminds me of Cyrus Parsa, because both of them
pretend to be experts on AI and 5G and they blame everything on China.
Cyrus Parsa has a master's degree in homeland security. Celeste Solum
also says that she used to work for FEMA and DHS, but she's another one
of these people who claim to be former insiders in the system, and who
are interviewed by people like Stew Peters and Mike Adams, and who talk
about topics like AI, nanotechnology, quantum dots, and hydrogel. I
think Cyrus Parsa first entered into alt media through Owen Shroyer's
show, which should be a huge red flag. The oldest tweet I found which
mentioned Parsa was made in October 2019 by an account called <span
class="quote">"Informal Warfare"</span> whose profile picture is a
drawing of Alex Jones, and the second oldest tweet I found was a link to
an interview that Parsa did with Owen Shroyer the same day.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=until%<wbr>3A2019-<wbr>12-<wbr>30+%<wbr>22cyrus+<wbr>parsa%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
In December 2019, Parsa filed a lawsuit against <span
class="quote">"Google L.L.C, Facebook inc, DeepMind Inc, Alphabet Inc,
Neuralink Inc, Tesla Inc, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, Mark
Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, CISON PR NewsWire &amp; John Doe's 1-29"</span>
for reasons such as <span class="quote">"MISUSE OF ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE, CYBERNETICS, ROBOTICS, BIOMETRICS, BIOENGINEERING, 5G AND
QUANTUM COMPUTING TECNNOLOGY, and for transfering AI technology to
China, and for violation of several genocide conventions because of
China's treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Christians, and Falun
Gong"</span>.

One of the oldest tweets I found which mentioned Parsa was posted by an
account named <span class="quote">"Uyghurtrailblazer"</span> which
tweeted: <span class="quote">"A historic day for the Uyghurs and other
victims of China. Mr. Cyrus Parsa filed a suit against Google, FB and a
few others in California. Spread the news. I am calling on the Uyghurs

(For some reason there seems to be a huge number of these Uyghur
separatist accounts on Twitter who post in English.)</p>
<p>The same kind of people who are employed to produce disinformation
that is targeted against foreign adversaries are also employed to
produce disinformation that is targeted against the domestic population.
For example Dr. Eowyn had one of the most popular blogs about Sandy Hook
and she wrote three chapters in Jim Fetzer's book about Sandy Hook. In
2016 it was revealed that her real name was Maria Hsia Chang, and that
she was a practicioner of Falun Gong and she wrote a book about Falun
Gong where she presented them in a favorable light, and that she had
written several academic articles which basically promoted the line of
Epoch Times on East Asian policy.
[<a href=https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>crisisactorsguild.<wbr>com/<wbr>2016/<wbr>01/<wbr>18/<wbr>who-<wbr>writes-<wbr>this-<wbr>shit-<wbr>who-<wbr>is-<wbr>dr-<wbr>eowyn/<wbr></a>]
Her old bio on the website of her university said that she <span
class="quote">"is a lecturer for the U. S. Department of Defense's Joint
Counterintelligence Training Academy, as well as the U. S. Marine Corps
War College"</span>.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20070104091632/<wbr>http://<wbr>www.<wbr>unr.<wbr>edu/<wbr>cla/<wbr>polisci/<wbr>famaria_<wbr>hsia_<wbr>chang.<wbr>htm</a>]
Dr. Eowyn also collaborated with David Weiss, who used to be an
assistant of the Sandy Hook hoaxer Wolfgang Halbig. David Weiss later
became a flat earther, and in March 2020 he was one of the very first
big names in alt media who started to say that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does
not exist.
[<a href=novirus.html#David-Weiss-and-Timothy-Rothschild>novirus.<wbr>html#<wbr>David-<wbr>Weiss-<wbr>and-<wbr>Timothy-<wbr>Rothschild</a>]
One video that David Weiss did with Stew Peters was titled <span
class="quote">"TRUTH About Flat Earth Theory: Biblical Firmament
vs. Round Ball Earth Propaganda"</span>, and the description of the
video said: <span class="quote">"This week on Stew Peters premium, we
are joined by Dave Weiss to discuss NASA and Big Tech's lies surrounding
the shape of the earth we all live on."</span>
[<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/truth-about-flat-earth-theory-biblical-firmament-vs-round-ball-earth-propaganda/>https://<wbr>stewpeters.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>2022/<wbr>11/<wbr>truth-<wbr>about-<wbr>flat-<wbr>earth-<wbr>theory-<wbr>biblical-<wbr>firmament-<wbr>vs-<wbr>round-<wbr>ball-<wbr>earth-<wbr>propaganda/<wbr></a>]
A month later when Weiss appeared for a second time on Stew's show, the
other guest during the same show was the <span class="quote">"former
Special Operations psyop officer"</span> Emily Grace Rainey.
[<a href=https://www.stewpeters.com/video/2022/12/power-blackouts-sweep-nation-former-special-operations-psyop-officer-warns-of-incoming-war/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>stewpeters.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>2022/<wbr>12/<wbr>power-<wbr>blackouts-<wbr>sweep-<wbr>nation-<wbr>former-<wbr>special-<wbr>operations-<wbr>psyop-<wbr>officer-<wbr>warns-<wbr>of-<wbr>incoming-<wbr>war/<wbr></a>]
I don't know how long Stew Peters has been a flat earther, but by 2023
he was saying on Twitter that the earth is flat.
[<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1686187946141999105>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>realstewpeters/<wbr>status/<wbr>1686187946141999105</a>,

<p>Mike Yeadon recommended people to listen to interviews of the flat
earther Sage of Quay: <span class="quote">"If you don't yet have that
understanding, that a small group of powerful families have organised
the way the world works with increasing precision down the centuries, it
will be harder to see the otherwise <span class="quote">'hidden

Williams aka Sage of Quay."</span>

Sage of Quay was one of the flat earthers who were early promoters of
the theory that the novel coronavirus was not real. His blog has now
been deleted and his posts weren't archived at the Wayback Machine, but
he seems to have posted videos about the no-virus theory by Owen
Benjamin and David Icke in early April 2020, and he may have already
written about the theory in March 2020.

<p>In October 2022, Latypova posted an interview she did with David
Nixon on BitChute. The description of the video said: <span
class="quote">"I recently spoke with Dr. David Nixon who was able to
conduct several experiments with Pfizer injectable substance under

<p>However I found two people who had interviewed Nixon before Latypova,
who were Maria Zeee and Ana Maria Mihalcea.

Nixon's interview with Maria Zeee was translated by La Quinta Columna to
French, Spanish, and Portuguese, and the translated versions were
mirrored by several channels on Rumble, BitChute, and Odysee.</p>
<p>Latypova posted several tweets like this where she promoted David
Nixon's microscope images:
[<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706455087512740183>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>sasha_<wbr>latypova/<wbr>status/<wbr>1706455087512740183</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-smartbubbles.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>In October 2022, Latypova even wrote an article about David Nixon's
microscope imagery for trialsitenews.com, where she didn't have anything
critical to say about Nixon's images, but she just wrote that the
rectangular structures that were shown in the videos were not
cholesterol or salt crystals:
[<a href=https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>trialsitenews.<wbr>com/<wbr>a/<wbr>direct-<wbr>microscopic-<wbr>examination-<wbr>of-<wbr>pfizers-<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>injections-<wbr>contents-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>vials-<wbr>are-<wbr>interacting-<wbr>with-<wbr>electromagnetic-<wbr>fields%<wbr>2e-<wbr>0d437119</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-trialsite.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>In 2022 Maria Zeee broke the news that David Nixon had found
self-assembling robot arms in COVID vaccines.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1prv94-world-first-robotic-arms-assembling.html>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v1prv94-<wbr>world-<wbr>first-<wbr>robotic-<wbr>arms-<wbr>assembling.<wbr>html</a>]
At time 8:52, Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"I want to ask you,
Dr. Nixon, because it looks like little robot arms, even."</span> Then
Nixon circled the part of the video below where I added the red circle,
and he said: <span class="quote">"This is - this - you look at the way
the levers are working in this - but, you know that - you've got
triangles, you've got levers, you've got pinchers. [...] It even falls up
on itself, goes up to get the leverage. [...] It creates some sort of a
propulsion system, I mean, you look at the rotation on
<em>that</em>."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-robot-arm.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Nixon has said that his photos were taken with a regular optical
microscope at 400-fold or 2000-fold magnification level. However Ana
Maria Mihalcea wrote that one of Nixon's photos featured a <span
class="quote">"carbon nanotube"</span>:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20240000000000%<wbr>2a/<wbr>https://<wbr>anamihalceamdphd.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>new-<wbr>images-<wbr>of-<wbr>self-<wbr>assembly-<wbr>structures</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-nanotube.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Nixon's videos actually even display the real
contents of vaccine vials, but if they do, then the crystallized
structures may be cholesterol, because cholesterol is an ingredient of
the Pfizer vaccines:

<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-cholesterol.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>In September 2022, Latypova published a video on BitChute where she
interviewed the Israeli electric engineer Shimon Yanowitz, who showed
photos of his blood under a light microscope.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>9ZFHWKEYxlCa/<wbr></a>]
The description of the video said that <span class="quote">"the images
show disturbing changes which are typical of the blood after Covid-19
injections, yet Shimon did not have the shots"</span>. Yanowitz said
that the objects in his blood may have come from either shedding or
chemtrails. At time 9:48, he said that the <span
class="quote">"ribbon"</span> in the photo below might be Morgellons,
and that it looked <span class="quote">"very mean"</span> and that it
made red blood cells nervous: <span class="quote">"How did this ribbon -
we can maybe elaborate a lot, we can discuss if this is something called
Morgellons or another thing - but this seems to be composed of the same
material - maybe carbon-based - that we see in the jabbed people. And
this is very worrying, because I shouldn't be having it. We can see it's
not natural. It's definitely not organic. And it looks very mean. And
it's not the end of the story. And, so, you can also see that the red
blood cells are getting very nervous around this entity."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-yanowitz.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 13:55 in the interview with Latypova, Yanowitz said: <span
class="quote">"And this is just a tiny drop from my finger, and we can
see all these dinosaurs emerging from this tiny blood drop."</span> (So
maybe we can add dinosaurs to the list of objects that the Stew crew has
found in blood or vaccines... Even though actually Yanowitz just used the
word dinosaur as a descriptive term for a type of object that was
visible in the photos, but I bet a certain percentage of his audience
thinks that it's real dinosaurs.)</p>
<p>Latypova seemed to accept Yanowitz's claims at face value and she
didn't ask him any tough questions, just like was the case with her
interview with David Nixon. So is it a coincidence that Latypova did her
alt media debut on the Stew Peters Show and she is promoting all of
these Stew ops?</p>
<p>The oldest BitChute video I found that featured Yanowitz was an
interview he did with the no-virus Jew Tom Cowan.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=shimon+yanowitz>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>search/?<wbr>query=shimon+<wbr>yanowitz</a>]
The oldest tweets which match the name Shimon Yanowitz in double quotes
are also about his interview with Tom Conman.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22shimon+yanowitz%22+until%3A2021-4-30&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=%<wbr>22shimon+<wbr>yanowitz%<wbr>22+<wbr>until%<wbr>3A2021-<wbr>4-<wbr>30&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]</p>
<p>I believe Karen Kingston made her alt media debut in July 2021 when

When Karen Kingston first appeared on the shows of Doug Billings and
Stew Peters, she was presented as a former Pfizer employee whose big
revelation was that COVID vaccines contain graphene oxide and hydrogel:

<blockquote>
<p>Stew Peters brings us another blockbuster interview with Karen
Kingston, a former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the
pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She comes forward with
indisputable documentation that must be shared with the ENTIRE WORLD,
immediately.</p>
<p>She says, <span class="quote">"I read the patent to look for graphene
oxide. It is not listed in the patent because it is a trade secret.
Remember, Bill Gates saying that there was a trade secret?"</span>
However, the Chinese patent does list graphene oxide. She says the main
reason it's not listed in the US patent is because graphene oxide is
poisonous and it's well-known that it's poisonous. The other reason is
because it's the main ingredient of Hydrogel, which is the liquid AI
template that's used for some of Elon Musk's research and Bill Gates, as
far as creating an interface between humans and the internet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Karen Kingston later also started to say that COVID vaccines
contained hydras and snake venom. In 2021 Stew Peters asked her: <span
class="quote">"So you are equivocally saying that hydra exists in this
shots?"</span> Then she answered: <span class="quote">"Transgenic hydra
does. So transgenic hydra is like a chimeric virus. It's when you take
an organism and you artificially induce DNA from other organisms, other
species, into that organism."</span>

microscope. And we observed a bizarre chemical process - or you know,
the physical chemical process - that is not consistent with just being
kind of a suspension in water solution of lidocaine. It was clearly
hydrogel. And hydrogels are used in injection in various materials -
various medical materials - but they should be disclosed. This wasn't
disclosed anywhere. And hydrogels are used to increase the stability of
a fragile component, or increase the circulation time in the body, or
stability. And so maybe that's why they formulated it this way, but they
don't disclose it."</span>

35:55] Near the end of the interview Jane Ruby asked if there's also
hydrogel in the white long calamari clots that have supposedly been
found by embalmers and funeral directors like Richard Hirschman, but
Latypova answered that hydrogel is probably incorporated into the

<p>In September 2023 Latypova tweeted a photo of a glass vial with the

In another tweet Latypova stated it as a fact that COVID vaccines were
formulated in <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span>, and not even
plain old hydrogel:

David Nixon and Shimon Yanowitz. Her blog post about the video said:
<span class="quote">"Shimon Yanowitz, a researcher from Israel joined me
and David on a zoom call to observe in real time what happens with a
common dental anesthetic injectable under microscope. The brand of
anesthetic is Septodont and the product name is Lignospan. David placed
a drop of it on a microscope slide and simply observed as it was drying.
The process revealed that the substance is likely hydrogel due to the
<span class="quote">'bubbling'</span> phenomenon as it dries. The
process becomes more energetic when a cellphone is placed next to the
sample."</span>

<p>Someone made a compilation of video clips about dental anesthetic,
which featured a clip where Latypova told Jane Ruby that people should
avoid getting sustained release dental anesthetic because it contains
hydrogel, and a clip where Latypova talked to Jane Ruby about her video
with David Nixon:

<img src=i/pfizerstew-dentaltotality.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Latypova also had an original theory that variation in batch
lethality might be explained by variation in the level of hydrogel in
the batches:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230712153341/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/more-on-the-issue-of-placebo-batches>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20230712153341/<wbr>https://<wbr>sashalatypova.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>more-<wbr>on-<wbr>the-<wbr>issue-<wbr>of-<wbr>placebo-<wbr>batches</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am fairly certain that there were no saline placebo batches in
broad commercial distribution (with exception of televised injections of
government officials and dedicated Pfizer/Moderna employee batches).
Here is why.</p>
<p>Vax substance visually looks different from normal saline, because it
is formulated as a special type of hydrogel. Very likely it's what is
called DARPA hydrogel, stuff that places like Robert Langer lab at MIT
and Charles Lieber lab at Harvard work on.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Also, Melissa MacAtee, a whistleblower from Pfizer Chesterfield
manufacturing facility reported this appearance of substance in vials.
It glows opalescent blue, because it is a hydrogel:</p>
<p><img src=i/pfizerstew-mcatee-hydrogel.webp width=160></p>
<p>She reported that Pfizer placed labels on vials unusually low to hide
the substance, but it could still be visible when the product is handled
anywhere in the supply chain. Therefore, if there were vials of saline
amongst vials with hydrogel, someone would notice this. Too much risk of
accidental detection by people who are not in on the scam.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>So, there could be a possibility that Pfizer <span
class="quote">"dilutant"</span> is empty LNP (hydrogel). It is possible
to formulate a thin version of hydrogel such that it looks like water.
In the places where it was used people would get higher toxicity events
and in other places where they got their own saline procured - would be
lower toxicity.</p>
<p>My current conclusion is that all vials are hydrogel, and some
contain more concentrated toxic biological materials (nucleic acid
chains), plasmid DNA, toxic metals and other garbage. Empty hydrogel is
not benign, but it also gets unevenly diluted during vaccination, and
that results in another level of heterogeneity which explains why many
people don't have any side effects. Some doses end up being mostly
saline with a bit of hydrogel that does not cause much damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Substack post I quoted above, Latypova referred to the <span
class="quote">"Pfizer whistleblower"</span> Melissa McAtee. The earliest
tweet about her I found was from October 2021, when she appeared on
Project Veritas as a whistleblower who said that Pfizer vaccines contain
luciferace and graphene oxide.

She was soon later interviewed by Candace Owens on DailyWire and by the
MyPillow guy's cohost on Lindell TV, and an article about her was
published by Red Voice Media, and the next month she also appeared on
Stew Peters.

<p>When Karen Kingston first emerged in alt media, her two big
reveleations were that COVID vaccines contained graphene oxide and that
COVID vaccines contained hydrogel. Even though Latypova pushed the story
about hydrogel, she said that Kingston's story about graphene oxide was
fake: <span class="quote">"This is based on a fake story in Expose which
was fed to everyone by Karen Kingston. She designed that fake story
knowingly, as she is competent enough to read the Pfizer report quoted
and see it was not about the GO in the jab composition. this is how fake

Pfizer document is unrelated to vax ingredients, it's just an imaging
experiment where graphene is used for cryo-EM imaging set up. Karen
Kingston mislead a bunch of good people.

<p>In November 2022, Reiner Füllmich's International Crimes
Investigative Committee hosted a panel about nanotechnology. The main
stars of the panel were Shimon Yanowitz and David Nixon, who claimed
that they had used a light microscope to find self-assembling structures
in their blood and in COVID vaccines. It was the first time when Mike
Yeadon was featured as a co-host of Füllmich's panel (even though to
Yeadon's credit, he actually said in a polite way that the evidence

an interaction between what materials are being pumped into the people
through these injections and other means. And the, the
telecommunications aspect, because - you know, and I just started
discussing it and I will be with the next expert, we'll be talking more
about it - but they told me, you know, 5G - the difference between 5G
and all the previous Wi-Fi's is that if 5G is beam-forming. The other
ones were, you know, you just kind of spread it around and once it
spread around, it doesn't really hit anything, you know, in so much
energy. What happens with the beam-forming, it concentrates energy. And
for example, if you are, if I am here on my cell phone, I have this
material in my body that is super conductive like graphene, I'm on my
cell phone. And then as behind me, if 5G is beam-forming, it's going to
hit me because it's trying to access my cell phone. And I can be in the,
in the direct hit of this energy that then going through me will find
graphene. And it will increase and, you know, graphene can resonate at
much higher frequency. And it will create energy, it will create micro
burst of energy where that graphene exists in my body."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:00:23, Latypova said: <span class="quote">"Now as far as
what is being shed, it's hard to say. It could be spike protein, but it

can be induced by other means, such as in different materials,
nanoparticulate contaminants, maybe metals, any types of toxicity -
cellular toxicity - I'm pretty sure can produce it."</span></p>

contained graphine oxide: <span class="quote">"Does graphene oxide

previously, my current educated guess is that GO is the <span
class="quote">'new asbestos'</span> that can be legally used in making
of food and drugs (because there are no regulations of it). Among new
materials uses as drug carriers, graphene oxide has been widely used due
to its high biocompatibility with a high drug loading capacity. It is
likely used in filtration or as a component of hydrogels used in the
injectable mRNA vaxxes and possibly other injectable drugs now.
Specifically, GO is well dispersed in an aqueous solution, which
significantly enhances the interfacial bonding within the components,
and transfer stress efficiently. These advantages make GO an attractive
nanocomposite material as a drug carrier in the field of biomedicine and
biotechnology, while being combined with a polymer or inorganic matrix
(which is what DARPA hydrogel is - a polymer matrix)."</span>

mesospores, SIM cards, <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> parasites, hydrogel,
microbubbles, long stick-like organisms, parasites attached to magnets,

<p>In April 2022 before Latypova had started her Substack, she wrote a
long article about the Pfizer trials that was published by Solari.
[<a href=https://solari.com/review-of-pfizers-non-clinical-program-by-sasha-latypova/>https://<wbr>solari.<wbr>com/<wbr>review-<wbr>of-<wbr>pfizers-<wbr>non-<wbr>clinical-<wbr>program-<wbr>by-<wbr>sasha-<wbr>latypova/<wbr></a>]
Latypova later presented the article in the fourth symposium of Doctors
for COVID Ethics, which was organized by D4CE in collaboration with CHD,
Solari, and UK Column.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-iv-freedom-is-the-cure/>https://<wbr>doctors4covidethics.<wbr>org/<wbr>gold-<wbr>standard-<wbr>covid-<wbr>science-<wbr>in-<wbr>practice-<wbr>an-<wbr>interdisciplinary-<wbr>symposium-<wbr>iv-<wbr>freedom-<wbr>is-<wbr>the-<wbr>cure/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>The fifth D4CE symposium featured presentations by Catherine Austin
Fitts, two other people from Solari, Sasha Latypova, and the nanobot
propagandist trio of Daniel Broudy, David Hughes, and Valerie Kyrie.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-v-in-the-midst-of-darkness-light-prevails/>https://<wbr>doctors4covidethics.<wbr>org/<wbr>gold-<wbr>standard-<wbr>covid-<wbr>science-<wbr>in-<wbr>practice-<wbr>an-<wbr>interdisciplinary-<wbr>symposium-<wbr>v-<wbr>in-<wbr>the-<wbr>midst-<wbr>of-<wbr>darkness-<wbr>light-<wbr>prevails/<wbr></a>]
All members of the trio write for an online publication called
Propaganda in Focus. The thumbnail of their presentation showed one of
David Nixon's microscope images, and a follow-up article to their
presentation was published by Solari.

<p>A bio of David Hughes says that he lectures in security studies and
his areas of research include <span class="quote">"psychological

Valerie Kyrie's bio says that she is <span class="quote">"working in the
areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and
psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that her
<span class="quote">"doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of
reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>.

Daniel Broudy used to serve in military intelligence but he is now an
expert on propaganda. Broudy and Kyrie have also coauthored two papers
about nanotechnology in vaccines that were published by IJVTPR.</p>
<p>The editorial board of IJVTPR includes Daniel Broudy and Shimon
Yanowitz, but it also includes Mary Holland and Brian Hooker from CHD.

And it includes Mark Skidmore who coauthored articles about the <span
class="quote">"missing money"</span> with Catherine Austin Fitts, and
who conducted a vaccine survey that was funded by Fitts. Skidmore also
pushed stories about graphene razor blades and vaccine-induced
magnetism.

Another person on the editorial board of IJVTPR is Tamara Tuuminen, who
was the first author of a paper about vaccinated people being

<p>In 2024 Solari named David Hughes as their hero of the week.

<p>In 2024 and 2025, Fitts organized two <span
class="quote">"Omniwar"</span> symposiums that were livestreamed by CHD,
and that featured a similar cast of characters as the earlier symposiums
hosted by Doctors for COVID Ethics. Both Omniwar symposiums featured
presentations by David Hughes and Daniel Broudy. A tweet about the
second symposium said: <span class="quote">"The Solari Report and
Catherine, collaborating with the four members of the Study Group on
Technology and Power - technocracy expert Patrick Wood (<span

<p>The pinned post on David Nixon's Substack promotes a book by David
Hughes.

The book featured endorsements by five people, who were Catherine Austin
Fitts, Daniel Broudy, the nanobot microscopist guy Mat Taylor, and two
people I was not familiar with (Bruce Scott and Kees van der Pijl).</p>
<p>The Omniwar symposium also featured a presentation about
nanotechnology by Lissa Johnson, whose bio says: <span
class="quote">"Dr. Lissa Johnson is an independent researcher who writes
about the psychological aspects of public affairs, psychological
operations, human rights abuse, citizenship, and the exercise and abuse
of power. Her qualifications include undergraduate degrees in media
studies and in behavioural science, with an honours thesis in
neuroimmunology, an MA in clinical psychology, and a PhD on the
psychological processes involved in manipulating
reality-perception."</span>

So she even did her PhD degree on the manipulation of reality
perception, just like Valerie Kyrie. I wonder what kind of employment
opportunities there are for people who are experts on the manipulation
of reality perception.</p>
<p>In 2024 the CHD came under fire because they published an interview
of Ana Maria Mihalcea, who said that she saw nanobots and quantum dots
in vaccines under a microscope, that she and David Nixon found
microchips that emitted MAC addresses in vaccines, that there's MAC
addresses emitted from graves, that calamari clots are formed when
nanobots eat red blood cells, that calamari clots contain the same
polymers that are being sprayed in chemtrails, and that there's
microelectronics from chemtrails in the blood of wild deer.

Mihalcea was interviewed by Mary Holland, who had little negative to say
about Mihalcea's claims. CHD responded to criticism of the video by
saying that Mihalcea's claims were backed up by a presentation by Lissa
Johnson in the first Omniwar symposium:

<p>CHD's CEO Mary Holland has degrees in Russian and Soviet studies, she
spent a semester in the USSR in college, and she studied Soviet law
under a Federal Language Area Studies scholarship program.

The Wikipedia article about area studies says: <span class="quote">"Area
studies programs originated within the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services, the predecessor agency to the CIA"</span>.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_studies>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Area_<wbr>studies</a>]
The same article says: <span class="quote">"Since their inception, area
studies have been subject to criticism - including by area specialists
themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were
connected to the Cold War agendas of the CIA, the FBI, and other
intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was
tantamount to serving as an agent of the state."</span> Her scholarship
program was previously called the National Defense Foreign Language
Fellowship program, which was funded by the National Defense Education
Act.

A paper about the history of Russian studies said: <span
class="quote">"The transplantation of the OSS to Columbia's Russian
Institute (RI), founded in 1946, seemed most direct - yet deceptively
so. The RI's founding director was Geroid Tanquary Robinson, a historian
who had run the office's USSR Division; economist Abram Bergson (who had
led Robinson's economics branch) was also on the founding staff of the
RI. The other key RI faculty (legal scholar John Hazard and historian
Philip Mosely) had served in the State Department during the war. [...]
The RI's M.A. degree, in particular, aimed to train Russia experts for
work in government agencies. (In the argot of Sovietology, references to
unspecified <span class="quote">'government agencies'</span> usually
meant the CIA, though it could include the State Department.)"</span>

But Columbia's Russian Institute is where Mary Holland got her MA degree
in Russian studies. Mary Holland later also worked for three years in
Moscow, and she wrote a book titled <span class="quote">"Human Rights
and Legal Reform in the Russian Federation"</span> for an NGO called
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.

Ethan Burger currently teaches a seminar at the school about offensive

In October 2020 the CHD published her article where she said that there

that the technology would have enabled tracking people remotely, and it

<p>In 2025 CHD posted a video where Suzanne Humphries said that she saw

In 2025 when Catherine Austin Fitts was on the Danny Jones podcast, she
said: <span class="quote">"I absolutely believe that they were trying to
install operating systems in people's bodies. [...] There's a great clip
from right at the beginning of the pandemic when the chief scientist
officer of Moderna says, <span class="quote">'We're installing an
operating system in people's bodies.'</span> And he - you know, he's
describing something that can be used - plug and play for future
vaccines - but if you look at all the material on the internet of
bodies, you know, you're talking about putting materials in people's
bodies that make them basically easier to interact with
telecommunications and digital technology. [...] If you get a lot of these
nanoparticles into the human body, you're creating the equivalent of an
organic barcode."</span>

When Danny Jones said there was little evidence of nanotechnology in
COVID vaccines, Fitts told him to watch the presentations in her Omniwar
symposium. And she said that there's mysterious ingredients in vaccines
and mysterious ingredients in chemtrails, and that one purpose of the
ingredients is to <span class="quote">"install an operating system in
your body"</span>.</p>
<p>After people criticized Suzanne Humphries for her claim about the
microchips, she wrote on Twitter: <span class="quote">"I find the
gaslighting very interesting. It's kind of making me even more sure that
there is something very significant about what I found. I'm going to

Then she posted some of her microscope photos that looked similar to
photos that had been earlier posted by David Nixon and Ana Maria
Mihalcea, so someone asked if they were Mihalcea's photos, but Humphries
said: <span class="quote">"She was reporting using my findings. I once
had a website called life of the blood. Now my videos are only on
BITCHUTE because I don't have to pay to put them there. I invited people
all throughout the world to replicate what I did and gave the exact
mechanism that I Used. So she is not plagiarizing. She is simply
reporting and re-publishing what I published."</span>

The lifeoftheblood.com website was now deleted, and I didn't find
Humphrey's name mentioned in an archived snapshot of the website, but
the website just said that it was run by an <span

In July 2025 when Fitts published her interview with Humphries, she
wrote: <span class="quote">"Presenting credible evidence of undisclosed
ingredients subjected these experts to fierce bullying and attempts to
discredit them. However, as Youngmi Lee and Daniel Broudy wrote in 2024,

<p>Catherine Austin Fitts was one of the earliest big names in alt media

<p>Catherine Austin Fitts was a member of the Arlington Institute, which
is a think tank founded by the futurist John Petersen.

Their board of directors also included David Martin and the former CIA

2006.

In 2021 a film called <span class="quote">"Planet Lockdown"</span>
premiered at an event organized by the Arlington Institute. Its main
star was Catherine Austin Fitts but it also featured David Martin.

<p>David Martin did many of his earliest appearances in alt media
together with Sacha Stone, but Sacha Stone was another one of the
earliest big names in alt media who started to say that viruses are not
real. Around the year 2010, Sacha Stone was the <span
class="quote">"Director-General of Europe"</span> of the
Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Organization, and David Martin was
the chairman of IREO's <span class="quote">"Economic Innovations
Committee"</span>.

In 2010 when Sacha Stone's Humanitad Foundation and IREO jointly
launched an <span class="quote">"Exemplar Zero Initiative"</span>, David
Martin hosted a ceremony in New York which celebrated the launching of
the initiative.

In 2013 Sacha Stone, David Martin, and Catherine Austin Fitts were
speakers at a Global Breakthrough Energy Movement conference.

The conference was organized by the Dutch people who also organized the
Secret Space Program conference, and who now do the video and audio
production for Catherine Austin Fitts and who run Solari Europa.

<p>In May 2022 Jane Ruby organized an event at Palm Beach called <span

consisted of David Martin, Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, and Mike
Yeadon:

<p>Sasha Latypova's company iCardiac conducted clinical trials, but
David Martin was also the president of a company called Mosaic Tech
which worked with clinical trials.

<p>In July 2023 David Martin did an interview with Alec Zeck where he
said that viruses are not real, that nucleic acids are not real, that
DNA is not real, and that atoms are not real.

Alec Zeck said: <span class="quote">"So just to be clear here, so when

definition of poison, I'm talking about a tiny replication-competent

Martin told him: <span class="quote">"All bulls**t, 100%
bulls**t."</span> Next Martin said: <span class="quote">"DNA does not
exist."</span> [42:41] And Zeck replied: <span class="quote">"I don't
disagree with that."</span> And Martin said: <span class="quote">"It
doesn't."</span> David Martin also said: <span class="quote">"There are
no atoms, there never have been, and there never will be."</span>
[44:52] And he said: <span class="quote">"The model of an atom then

<p>On the howbad.info website, the members of Team Enigma are listed as
Mike Yeadon, Alexandra Latypova, Craig Paardekooper, Walter Wagner, and
Jessica Rose (in that order).
[<a href=https://www.howbad.info/background.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>howbad.<wbr>info/<wbr>background.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>Around two months before Latypova presented Team Enigma's data on the
Stew Peters Show in January 2022, Expose News published two articles
about Team Enigma's findings. The first article was titled <span
class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - 100% of Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused
by just 5% of the batches produced according to official Government
data"</span>, and the second article was titled <span
class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - VAERS data shows 100% of reported Covid-19
Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of batches produced and the
majority were sent to red Republican States across the USA"</span>.

<p>In October 2021 Steve Kirsch emailed the other article by Expose News
to WelcomeTheEagle88, Jessica Rose, and Mathew Crawford, after which
they started investigating the data, and WelcomeTheEagle88 emailed Craig
Paardekooper about some errors in the data.
[<a href=https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/jj-couey-george-webb-latypova-hot>https://<wbr>welcometheeagle.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>jj-<wbr>couey-<wbr>george-<wbr>webb-<wbr>latypova-<wbr>hot</a>]
Then WelcomeTheEagle88 wrote that afterwards Yeadon joined Team Enigma
through Kirsch's circle: <span class="quote">"It was shortly after this
that Mike Yeadon was putting his feelers out basically looking for Team
Enigma through Steve Kirsch and friends. I can't find the email, but I
actually responded to Dr. Yeadon, I actually thought he was looking for
me?"</span> WelcomeTheEagle88 also wrote: <span class="quote">"it was
Team Enigma aka Craig Paardekooper and Sasha Latypova that were first
out of the gate with lot# number analysis and then the help of Dr. Mike
Yeadon, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, and Reiner Fuellmich the story and Team
Enigma launched"</span>.</p>
<p>Latypova also said that she was in contact with Kirsch in 2021 (even
though at that point I believe she hadn't appeared anywhere in alt
media): <span class="quote">"I told Steve the product was adulterated in
2021, he dismissed me and my analysis as <span
class="quote">'conspiracy'</span>, he actually used that word."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1716113671955354057>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>sasha_<wbr>latypova/<wbr>status/<wbr>1716113671955354057</a>]</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon said: <span class="quote">"I was at the scene of the
accident. The person who did the work originally was a British guy
called Craig Paardekooper, Craig Paardekooper. And Sasha Latypova and
Mike Yeadon saw this and we made a beeline for him. And that's how
Sasha, Mike, and Craig met. So I didn't make any contribution to the
analysis, except to say it cannot be tolerable that we have this degree
of batch-to-batch variation."</span>

<p>Jane Ruby had discussed the articles by Expose News in 2021 before
she interviewed Latypova in January 2022, so I don't know if that's how
she came to be connected to Team Enigma and Latypova. However at the
start of one of Jane Ruby's interviews with Latypova, Ruby said: <span
class="quote">"My guest today is someone very special, who I've worked
with really since the beginning of the entire COVID scam in
2020."</span>

14:53] That was news to me, because I haven't found any references to
Latypova in alt media before 2022. So did she do her debut interview
with Stew Peters and Jane Ruby because she had known Jane Ruby long
before then?</p>
<p>In May 2021 when Jane Ruby was a guest host for Owen Shroyer's War
Room show, she also interviewed WelcomeTheEagle88 about VAERS data.

<p>Expose News is kind of a shady outlet, or it appears to be like the
British equivalent of Red Voice Media's news site, because both of them
have published a large number of articles about stories that are covered
on the Stew Peters Network. For example Expose News has published
articles about David Nixon's story that COVID vaccines contain
self-assembling microchips, Bryan Ardis's story that COVID is caused by
snake venom in the tap water and that COVID vaccines contain snake
venom, and Carrie Madej's story that COVID vaccines contain hydras.

<p>I had the impression that even though Latypova and Yeadon did
presentations of Team Enigma's work in alt media, most of the work was
done by Craig Paardekooper. But Latypova said: <span

analysis, I FOUND IT FIRST and published on it, and Craig read my work

<p>Latypova may have become involved in conspiracy-related topics on
social media organically, because she appears to have started posting on
Telegram about 911-related topics in February 2021, after which she
posted about COVID on Telegram anonymously:

<p>During a presentation that Jane Ruby did for an Israeli audience, she
said that she is <span class="quote">"a Jewish mother and a

<p>In 2016, Jane Ruby got mad that Obama's administration abstained from
voting against a UN resolution where the UN Security Council <span
class="quote">"reiterated its demand that Israel immediately and
completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem"</span>.

But then when Netanyahu refused to follow the resolution, Jane Ruby
tweeted: <span class="quote">"AND THE PEOPLE OF THE USA STAND BY <span

She said that it was a noose on Israel's neck when Obama's
administration abstained from voting against the UN resolution, and she
tweeted: <span class="quote">"FILTHY PHONY <span class="citation"

She told Obama that he was a traitor because he didn't support a foreign
country: <span class="quote">"@BarackObama The fact that you have never

When Obama tweeted that the world would be more peaceful and just if
everyone lived more like Elie Wiesel, Jane Ruby replied to Obama: <span

<p>In April 2020 a news site called Politichicks published an article by
Jane Ruby, who wrote that she had to cancel a dinner with Melania Trump
at Mar-a-Lago because she caught COVID.

Politichicks was supposedly started by two chicks, but most of their
recent articles seem to be written by Jewish men like Daniel Greenfield
and Jamie Glazov.

Greenfield. Jamie Glazov's father Yurij Yakovlevitch Glazov was a Soviet
scholar of Tamil, who was a Jewish convert to Catholicism.

<p>Cambridge Analytica was used semi-legally in USA (after consulting
with Rudi Giullliani's law firm) and had a campaign that flooded swing
states and middle America with sock puppet accounts spewing bile, fake
stories designed to outrage and videos showing France and Germany under
Sharia law. Many of these videos were produced or shared by Gatestone
Media which also provides content for Rebel Media. John Bolton sits on
the board Gatestone Media. He was the architect of the war on terror and
now the National Security Advisor. The main owner of Gatestone is Nina
Rosenwald who is the heiress to Sears. Nina Rosenwald was, in 2003, a
recipient of the Louis Brandeis Award, given by the Zionist Organization
of America for her pro-Israel advocacy. Rebecca Mercer also helps fund
Gatestone Media via her family foundation. Funding for Gatestone also
comes from the MEF (Middle East Forum) a hard line, conservative
pro-Israel think tank.</p>
<p>Robert Mercer also finances Rebel Media. Rebel media employs Tommy
Robinson, Lauren Southern and Laura Loomer all of whom are right wing
antagonists that are scant with the facts. Most of these people have at
some point been promoted by Breitbart or Infowars.</p>
<p>Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley Lennon, Paul Harris - see the article
below) and James O Keefe also receive funding via the David Horowitz
Freedom Center which is financed by Robert Shillman who is a board
member for Friends of Israel's Defence Forces. Robert Shillman also
provides funding for Rebel Media. Nina Rosenwald, the heiress to Sears,
also funds James O Keefe and Project Veritas. Geert Wilders, the Dutch
far right antagonist is also financed by the David Horowitz Freedom
Centre. The MEF helps fund Tommy Robinsons legal team (he is currently
in jail for breach of bail conditions - he jeopardised a trial by
filming the defendants specifically against court orders). According to
MEF, the organisation is also <span class="quote">"sponsoring and
organising the second <span class="quote">'Free Tommy Robinson'</span>
gathering in London on July 14"</span>. The statement was signed by MEF
Director Gregg Roman, who has previously <span class="quote">"worked in
Israel's Defence and Foreign Ministries"</span>.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Robert Mercer invested in Breitbart with money from his own personal
fortune and some from the Koch Brothers, via an investment arm called
G.A.I. G.A.I was ran by Mercer ally and ex Goldman Sachs exec Steve
Bannon, whose films Mercer has also financed. Steve Bannon goes on to
become chief editor of Breitbart when Andrew Breitbart dies and later
campaign manager and a top aide to President Trump. Mercer is the main
financier of Breitbart.</p>

<p>In 2017 Jane Ruby self-published a book about citizen journalism
titled <span class="quote">"A Sea of New Media: Transformation of the

The people she named as the rising stars of citizen journalism included
Laura Loomer, Mike Cernovich, James O'Keefe, and Jack Posobiec. She took
the title of the book from a speech by Andrew Breitbart, and she
dedicated her book to the media warriors who were following on the path
laid by Breitbart.

George Webb is another person who used to live in DC and who calls
himself a citizen journalist, and he self-published a book about citizen
journalism called <span class="quote">"Citizen Journalism &amp; Public

former co-host Jason Goodman by Lee Stranahan, who was a protege of
Andrew Breitbart.

<p>Latypova's daughter Soph used to have a YouTube channel with almost a

CENSORED.TV is the platform of Gavin McInnes, who was the founder of
Proud Boys and a co-founder of Vice Media. McInnes used to work for
Rebel Media, which Ezra Levant called <span class="quote">"my Zionist

had six colors like the gay flag, and not seven colors like the Jewish
Noahide flag):

<p>In 2024 Yeadon wrote: <span class="quote">"Part of my undergraduate

I don't know if developing antidotes against nerve agents was just a
cover, like how bioweapon developers claim that they are developing
vaccines against viruses, or that they are trying to prevent the next
pandemic.</p>
<p>It might be that Yeadon only worked at Porton Down for a short time
as a college student, but if he already had a military clearance when he
was a college student, he may have later been involved in other work
which required a security clearance, or he may have been recruited to be
part of some intelligence network when he was in college.</p>
<hr />
<p>The UFO researcher Nick Redfern wrote that Porton Down was home to
experiments in the 1950s where British military personnel were
unwittingly subjected to LSD, and he also wrote that the Rendelsham
Forest UFO incident may have been a psychological operation that was
staged by people from Porton Down, who subjected the witnesses of the
incident to psychoactive drugs.

He also wrote the following about another UFO incident that involved
Porton Down: <span class="quote">"On the night of January 23, 1974, an
enigmatic event occurred in the large Berwyn Mountain range in North
Wales, United Kingdom, that, for some within the UFO research community,
has come to be known as the British Roswell. Researcher Andy Roberts
summed up this mysterious affair: <span class="quote">'The claim was
that a UFO piloted by extraterrestrials crashed, or was shot down, on
the mountain known as Cader Berwyn and that the alien crew, some still
alive, were whisked off to a secret military installation in the south
of England for study.'</span> That secret military installation was said
to be none other than Porton Down."</span>

So I wonder if Porton Down is home to work in psychological operations
in addition to research on chemical and biological weapons.</p>

<p>Similar to Yeadon, Norman Fenton and Martin Neil are British people
with impressive credentials who claim that the COVID pandemic was fake.
Fenton and Neil have both done work for the British defense and
intelligence agency DSTL, whose headquarters are located in Porton Down.

DSTL was formed in 2001, when the former Defense Evaluation and Research
Agency was split off into a private company called QinetiQ and a public
agency called DSTL. The main product of Fenton and Neil's company is the
AgenaRisk software, which was originally developed under the name
MODIST, but the lead partner of the MODIST project was QinetiQ, and the
project was managed by David Milledge from QinetiQ.

The chairman of Fenton and Neil's company from 2004 to 2020 was Nicholas
Birtles, who is now a director of an aerospace defense company called
AERALIS, which he started with his stepson who previously worked at
QinetiQ.

ties to the British armed forces, and that operates a program to find
civilian employment for members of the Royal Corps of Signals.

Fenton and Neil have also served as consultants for IARPA, and in a
project that was part of IARPA project CREATE, the authors created a
Bayesian reasoning software called BARD that was based on Fenton and
Neil's AgenaRisk software.

<p>In 2012 Jane Ruby was employed as medical affairs manager for the
pharmaceutical company Individor whose products included a alternative
to Subutex called Subuxone. She falsified data about Subuxone which led
to their CEO being criminally convicted:
[<a href=https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2021/alj-cr5928/index.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>hhs.<wbr>gov/<wbr>about/<wbr>agencies/<wbr>dab/<wbr>decisions/<wbr>alj-<wbr>decisions/<wbr>2021/<wbr>alj-<wbr>cr5928/<wbr>index.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case involves a company's effort to have one of its drugs
covered by the Medicaid program. To achieve this goal, a company
executive deliberately submitted false information to MassHealth, the
Massachusetts Medicaid agency. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act,
Petitioner, as the company's chief executive officer, was held
criminally accountable for the offense.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>On or about October 10, 2012, RADARS gave Dr. Ruby the
Massachusetts-specific analysis, but the results were not what she had
expected or hoped for. They showed that, among the three categories of
drugs (Suboxone Film, Suboxone Tablet, and buprenorphine-only tablets,
like Subutex Tablet), the buprenorphine-only tablets had the lowest rate
of unintended pediatric exposure. (1.8 exposures per 10, 000 units
versus 2.7 exposures for Suboxone Film and 3.3 exposures for Suboxone
Tablet). IG Ex. 2 at 7 (Information ¶ 25).[8]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby did not give Dr. Jeffrey an accurate version of the RADARS
analysis. Instead, she manipulated the data by adding the two tablet
rates together in order to show that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate
of unintentional pediatric exposure in Massachusetts, when, in fact, it
did not. On or about October 16, 2012, she emailed the false data to
MassHealth, claiming, also falsely, that she had received the
calculations from RADARS. She forwarded a copy of her email to
Indivior's global medical director. IG Ex. 2 at 7-8 (Information ¶
27).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby subsequently received additional data on unintended
pediatric exposures; it showed that Suboxone Film <em>did not have the
lowest rate</em> of unintended pediatric exposure in Massachusetts. She
did not provide that data to MassHealth, telling other Indivior
employees (although not Petitioner) that her rationale for withholding
the additional data was <span class="quote">"don't ask, don't
tell."</span> IG Ex. 2 at 9 (Information ¶ 29).[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020 it was announced that the case resulted in a 600 million USD
penalty to Individor:

<blockquote>
<p>Drugmaker Indivior Solutions will pay $600 million in criminal and
civil liability over its marketing of opioid-addiction treatment
Suboxone, the Justice Department (DOJ) announced.</p>
<p>Indivior pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor in July for making
false statements to Massachusetts's Medicaid program, MassHealth, in
order to expand access to the drug for children.</p>
<p>Of the $600 million, the company was sentenced to pay $289 million in
criminal penalties Wednesday, according to the DOJ.</p>

I didn't find evidence of McClenton having an intelligence background,

for the US Army as <span class="quote">"a subject matter expert in
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense, protection,

several locations apart from DC over the period, so perhaps he picked DC

Germany, he gained experience in areas including intelligence

</h2>
<p>When Karen Kingston first appeared in alt media, she was presented as
a Pfizer whistleblower whose big revelation was that COVID vaccines
contained graphene oxide and hydrogel. Latypova has also said that
dental anesthetic contains hydrogel, and she presented photos by the
Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee as evidence that COVID vaccines
contain <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span>. So in order to
trace the origins of the story that COVID vaccines contained hydrogel, I
tried to search for early tweets about the story.

<p>The earliest tweet I found was a tweet from March 2020, which said:

The second-earliest tweet linked to a video by Celeste Solum that was
mirrored on YouTube by the flat earther Jamie Lee (aplanetruth 4u).

Many other early tweets also linked to YouTube videos by Celeste Solum,
so she may have in fact been the first person who was talking about
hydrogel in connection with COVID vaccines. Celeste specifically even
referred to hydrogel as a DARPA technology.</p>
<p>The earliest tweets that matched the phrase <span
class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span> were posted in March to April
2020, and I believe they all referred to videos by the FEMA
whistleblower Celeste Solum:

<p>Celeste Solum also said that COVID vaccines contain gorilla feces and
Neanderthal DNA:

<p>In April 2020 June Knight from WATB TV wrote an article about
hydrogel, where she referred to videos by Celeste Solum as her source.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928223834/https://watb.tv/darpa-hydrogel-sensor/>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200928223834/<wbr>https://<wbr>watb.<wbr>tv/<wbr>darpa-<wbr>hydrogel-<wbr>sensor/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>In an interview with Andrew Kaufman in May 2020, Max Igan talked
about DARPA hydrogel, but he referred to Celeste Solum as the source of
his information: <span class="quote">"Hydrogel is a - it's a
nanosubstance, it's developed by DARPA - which is able to fuse with your
cells, literally fuse with your cells. It goes in and it interfaces with
your cells and becomes part of you. And it can be read - signals - to
and from - it's like an interface into -. There's actually a report
that's been put out recently by a lady called Celeste Solum. She's quite
religious, I mean God bless her, she's quite religious, so the last part
of the talk is - last ten minutes is quite religious. But she's a great
researcher. Apparently she used to work in one of these weapons
development places. And she's a bit of an insider. And she's been
reporting on hydrogel. I'll send you a link after the talk, I'd be
interested in you having a look at that. And uh, because of the
possibility of this actually being in the vaccines, you know, this
particular nano-stuff that DARPA's been working on -. And by the way,
this is - they've been still working on this while the lockdown's in
place. You know, when you think about it, only essential services are
functioning, and the development of this hydrogel by DARPA is seen as an
essential service for national security. And with the separation of the
children - programming people to be separated, everyone be separated,
everyone 1.5 minutes apart, 2 minutes apart over time. Forget about
having children anymore. They want all the next generation of children
to be - I would suggest - vaccinated with this hydrogel, and interface
into the matrix, part of the AI machine, as soon as they're born, and
keep them all separated from each other. So basically the response to
this COVID-19 is to remove every aspect of humanity from humankind, keep
everybody completely separated, and make everyone - you know, fit them
into this interface - into the machine, whether they want it or not. Um,
I'd be really interested on you looking into that, and seeing how they
may be incorporating that into the vaccines. Cause what you're saying
about them modifying DNA, it fits in perfectly with what hydrogel can
actually do. And there's some papers on it, some DARPA papers you can
actually go look at. I'll send you some links after the talk."</span>

<p>Max Igan was also one of the first big names in alt media who started
to say that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not real, which was a theory that
was initially popularized by flat earthers in March 2020. I believe the
first four people in alt media who interviewed Andrew Kaufman were all
flat earthers, and the first one of them was James True, who
livestreamed Kaufman's first viral presentation, who called himself
Kaufman's lead writer, and who said that he had emptied his Patreon
account on producing, editing, and advertising Kafuman's videos. By 2023
Kaufman himself had turned into a flat earther. In January 2020 Max Igan
also did a video where he said that the earth was flat, but a few days
later he said that he had some kind of a breakdown because he was being
targeted with mind control technology, and he doesn't actually believe
in flat earth. However earlier in 2016 Max Igan did a video of his
flight from Chile to Australia, where he supposedly set out to disprove
the flat earth model by tracking the direction of his compass during the
flight, but he supposedly found that the compass pointed to a direction
that was consistent with a flat earth model, which was then used as
evidence that the earth was flat by Globebusters and Jeranism (even
though I think Igan staged the video in order to prop up the flat earth
theory). Andrew Kaufman's <span class="quote">"Hippocratic
Hypocrisy"</span> film was produced and narrated by people from the flat
earth channel Spacebusters, but the only way in which the film featured
Kaufman was that it featured clips of his interview with Max Igan.

<p>In a YouTube video in May 2020, Steven Ben-Nun from Israeli News Live
said: <span class="quote">"We've got a neighbor, she's been - her
daughter - excuse me, her mother is already caught on what's going on.
Her eyes are wide open. She realizes the danger of what's going on, the
dangers of this vaccine, et cetera. The DARPA - and of course the
hydrogel - the hydrogel that will actually infuse into your DNA - very,
very nasty stuff. And I got to kind of hold my tongue on this, because
on Israeli News Live we shouldn't be going into all these details here,
have to save that for Patreon - but let me just tell you this, the
neighbor shared with us - she took her son in to the doctor just
recently, he has asthma so he's always having trouble with - over this
asthmatic related issues there - and her doctor today warmed her to be
very cautious when it comes to the vaccine, and don't take it. By the
way they will put up their chip - yes, you got that right - but it's not
just any kind of chip. When you're dealing with hydrogel, you're talking
about infusing it into your DNA."</span>

Ben-Nun used to do many videos together with Celeste Solum, so he may
have heard about hydrogel from her, but then he lied that he heard about
it from his neighbor. Or maybe both Celeste and Ben-Nun got a script to
start talking about hydrogel. In 2020 Ben-Nun and his friend John Moore
were saying that Planet-X would pass by the earth in 2021 which would
cause most humans to die, and Ben-Nun was showing screenshots of emails
about Planet-X that he supposedly received from an unnamed source from
NASA. John Moore says that he is a former intelligence analyst for the
US government, and Ben-Nun has also called himself a former CIA
agent.</p>
<p>I found no COVID-related tweets that mentioned Carrie Madej until
July 2020 when a video by her went viral.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-7-7%20carrie%20madej&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=until%<wbr>3A2020-<wbr>7-<wbr>7%<wbr>20carrie%<wbr>20madej&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
One of the topics she discussed in the video was hydrogel. She said:
<span class="quote">"DARPA founded a company that produces soft flexible
hydrogels - I've mentioned hydrogels in the past - injected beneath the
skin to perform health monitoring. They sync to a smartphone app to give
the user immediate health insights. However hydrogel nanotechnology
grows and spreads in the body once implanted. We do not know how this
affects our DNA. We know that it can send information directly and
continuously to an artificial intelligence. Ok, so all of us have a
smartphone, mine included, we have health apps. One way or another it's
on your phone. Sometimes you have to look under a Google app, whatever,
it's there. You can disable it but you can't erase it. It's impossible.
This is a COVID-19 apps they're putting it into has to do with this.
They're getting you set up. You have an app, you have a software. Now
all you need is this little hydrogel that's put there. And then forever,
everything in your body is monitored. For a woman, your ovulation, when
you menstruate, how many times you've had sex - for a man how many times
you have had sex - how much alcohol content's in your body, your
vitamins and minerals, if you've fallen down, how many steps you're
taking, if you're anxious, your emotions and your sleep, everything
about you, continuously."</span>

17:38] Later in October 2021, I believe Carrie Madej became the first
person who started to say that COVID vaccines contained hydras.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if Carrie Madej is a Jew, but she said that her family
members died in the Holocaust, and she said that she uses the Messianic
Jewish Bible, and she posted a photo on Instagram which showed a page
from the New Testament in the Complete Jewish Bible.
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;TheZionistInspector/YouCut_20220808_061637448>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>TheZionistInspector/<wbr>YouCut_<wbr>20220808_<wbr>061637448</a>,

Celeste Solum and Steven Ben-Nun are also Messianic Jews. Richard
Hirschman's cover photo on Facebook used to be a photo that displayed
two Messianic Jewish books.
[<a href=https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=730445680433744&set=ecnf.100004049568699>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>facebook.<wbr>com/<wbr>photo/?<wbr>fbid=730445680433744&amp;<wbr>set=ecnf.<wbr>100004049568699</a>]
Hirschman's story about the white clots supposedly found by embalmers
was first broken on SPN, in the same way that Carrie's story about the
hydras was first broken on SPN.</p>
<p>In September 2020, David Icke's website published an article by Makia
Freeman about how COVID vaccines were going to contain DARPA hydrogel.

I believe David Icke first started saying that SARS-CoV-2 does not exist
on April 6th 2020 UTC when he was interviewed by London Real, but 5 days
earlier Icke's website published an article about the no-virus theory by
Makia Freeman.

<p>In December 2021, Sutoova, her father Stefan Suto and her husband
Steve Bennun all developed symptoms of COVID-19, although none tested
positive for it at the time.</p>
<p>Eighteen days after battling a fever, Suto would be dead in a hotel
room in Florida.</p>
<p>Not from sickness, but rather hemolytic anemia due to toxicities of
inhaled and intravenous hydrogen peroxide, according to an independent
autopsy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Johnson also criticized the family for not taking Suto to the
hospital.</p>
<p>Sutoova said at the time, her family had been told by doctors in the
medical freedom movement that the COVID procedures in hospitals were
killing people.</p>
<p>Johnson also pointed out a recent episode of the family's YouTube
channel, in which Bennun explored the flat earth theory, citing it as a
reason he would be a <span class="quote">"problematic witness"</span> to
a potential jury.</p>

<p><span class="quote">"There was such a division in the medical

<p>Bennun said along with Madej, the alternative medicine doctors in
Florida who continued the hydrogen peroxide treatment stopped speaking
with the family.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"They all turned their backs on us. That really
began to cause us to question this movement and what their real motives

<h2>
<a href=#Project_Veritas_whistleblower_Justin_Leslie id=Project_Veritas_whistleblower_Justin_Leslie>Project
Veritas whistleblower Justin Leslie</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2024 Justin Leslie came out as a whistleblower who said that
Project Veritas was controlled opposition and that James O'Keefe had
attended Bohemian Grove. He is supposed to have briefly worked for
Pfizer as a <span class="quote">"formulation analytical
scientist"</span>. He was meant to appear on Project Veritas as a Pfizer
whistleblower like their earlier Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee,
but O'Keefe never published his story. However he still did other work
for Project Veritas, and he was the undercover operative who recorded
his gay date with the mulatto Pfizer employee Jordon Walker (which was
such a big hit for O'Keefe that he has now churned out around ten more
videos with a similar yellow filter and a similar camera angle).</p>
<p>However Justin Leslie is probably about as genuine as other
whistleblowers on Project Veritas, because he claims he gave Carrie
Madej a vaccine vial which contained hydras, and he says that virology
is a pseudoscience:
[<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/documentary-indicates-james-okeefe-attended-bohemian-grove-suggests-hes-a-cia-asset>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>lifesitenews.<wbr>com/<wbr>news/<wbr>documentary-<wbr>indicates-<wbr>james-<wbr>okeefe-<wbr>attended-<wbr>bohemian-<wbr>grove-<wbr>suggests-<wbr>hes-<wbr>a-<wbr>cia-<wbr>asset</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After graduating from the University of Rhode Island in the spring of
2020 with a bachelor's degree in pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences,
documentary producer Justin Leslie states he entered a biomedical
science master's program at Rutgers University and then took a job as a
formulation analytical scientist at Pfizer in Andover, MA.</p>
<p>During the first semester of his master's studies, Leslie reports
coming to the realization <span class="quote">"that the whole COVID
narrative was absolute nonsense,"</span> that the so-called <span
class="quote">"vaccines were actually death shots,"</span> and even
further, in a position challenging a well-established consensus, he
became convicted that virology itself <span class="quote">"was one big
pseudoscience."</span></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>He further accepted his position at Pfizer in March 2021 with the
specific intention of becoming a whistleblower should he come across
important inside information, even having corresponded with Project
Veritas (PV) at this time to offer his services.</p>
<p>After reaching out to PV again, they provided him with undercover
recording equipment he began wearing to work in late September 2021.
Soon after, he provided PV with a vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine, and gathered with other PV personnel and Dr. Carrie Madej to
investigate the contents in a Mamaroneck, New York apartment on October
14, 2021.</p>
<p>Madej, an internist trained in osteopathic medicine, became
well-known on the internet warning viewers to avoid the COVID injections
and for examining these substances as well. On this occasion, Leslie
explains how the doctor guided the microscope examination of these
samples from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and the vial from Pfizer
which he had provided.</p>
<p>In the J&amp;J sample the group witnessed what the young
whistleblower explained as <span class="quote">"black circles and what
looked like parasites revolving around them as if they had a mind of
their own."</span> The Moderna and Pfizer samples <span
class="quote">"had similar parasitic-like creatures in them,"</span> and
while he couldn't identify what he was looking at, he said, <span
class="quote">"it was absolutely nightmarish to witness."</span></p>
<p>Six days later, Madej was a guest on the Stew Peters Show where she
explained these phenomena, also stating she had been working with an
<span class="quote">"amazing team"</span> from PV promising that they
would be <span class="quote">"giving their story very soon, which will
have so much detail, so much data, so please look for that."</span></p>
<p>But instead of releasing this story that several members of this PV
team witnessed themselves, Leslie states <span class="quote">"this
entire story was buried by Project Veritas"</span> and it never came
out, even as other researchers such as Dr. Robin Wakeling in New
Zealand, and Dr. David Nixon in Australia, corroborated the
findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article also mentioned that he promoted Stew ops about
changes in the blood of vaccinated people seen with dark field
microscopy, calamari clots, and luciferase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The documentary covers several other stories Leslie believes were of
vital importance to the public which were declined for publication by
Project Veritas. These include evidence of significant
<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/blood-damage-explains-many-harmful-impacts-of-covid-vaccines/>changes

<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bayer-executive-mrna-shots-are-gene-therapy-marketed-as-vaccines-to-gain-public-trust/>vaccine</a>

<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bombshell-pfizer-whistleblower-says-vaccine-glows-contains-toxic-luciferase-graphene-oxide-compounds/>luciferase</a>
being present in the injections, which Leslie testifies he witnessed
himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During an interview with Stew Peters in October 2021, Carrie Madej
said: <span class="quote">"I have worked with Project Veritas - an
amazing team there - and they were able to work with a whistleblower
from Pfizer, and through chain of custody they brought forward some of
the vials. So I have some of my own images. But Project Veritas will,
you know, be giving their story very soon which will have so much
detail, so much data."</span>

So it matches up with Justin Leslie's story.</p>
<p>The Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee has also said that COVID
vaccines contain hydrogel, nanotechnology, graphene oxide, and quantum
dots:</p>

<p>The earliest reference to Melissa McAtee/Strickler I found on Twitter

about 4 million views on YouTube).

<p>In April 2025 Justin Leslie said that the calamari clots are
teslaphoresis carbon nanotubial systems: <span class="quote">"It's more
just my perspective on the sense of what is the spike protein. It is
some sort of toxic poison that is inside of the vaccine in the way that
it was formulated. It is what was ultimately causing this teslaphoresis
carbon nanotubial system to be created inside the body, which is
ultimately what my hypothesis on the blood clots being pulled out of
people are. And so, you know, ultimately, from my perspective, it's not
even a lab leak, sir, it's a massive psychological operation."</span>

<p>Even though the authors used an optical microscope, they wrote that
they were able to see structures that resembled carbon nanotube
filaments: <span class="quote">"As time progressed during incubation,
simple one- and two-dimensional structures over two or three weeks
became more complex in shape and size developing into stereoscopically
visible entities in three-dimensions. They resembled carbon nanotube
filaments, ribbons, and tapes, some appearing as transparent, thin, flat
membranes, and others as three-dimensional spirals, and beaded
chains."</span> Ana Mihalcea also wrote that one of David Nixon's
optical microscope photos showed a <span class="quote">"carbon
nanotube"</span>.

<p>Daniel Broudy is a member of the editorial team of the journal IJVTPR
which published his paper.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>about/<wbr>editorialTeam</a>]
The editorial team also includes Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, Stephanie
Seneff, James Lyons-Weiler, Russell Blaylock, and Shimon Yanowitz.</p>
<p>The paper in IJVTPR said: <span class="quote">"The fact that such
nanotechnology is in the COVID-19 injectables was first discussed, we
believe, by Campra and colleagues (2021a, 2021b; Spectroscopy &amp;
Campra, 2021) and was followed up by Yanowitz (2022a, 2022b, 2023a,
2023b) as documented in part by Hughes (2022) with 26 references to
Campra et al. and 26 to Yanowitz's early work."</span> The references to
Yanowitz were links to videos he did with Sasha Latypova, Maria Zeee,
and Doctors for COVID Ethics.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the paper also mentioned Latypova: <span
class="quote">"Sasha Latypova, an executive and researcher for the
pharmaceutical industry, discovered an extreme deviation in side effects
among the batch-to-batch vials of mRNA COVID-19 injectables."</span>
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102/291>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>102/<wbr>291</a>]
However Latypova wrote this tweet about the paper: <span
class="quote">"I saw the research published in this paper being done a
year ago. I am in the same signal group with the authors. No judgement,
but the paper does NOT show <span class="quote">'self-assembling
nanotechnology'</span>. There is a bunch of optical microscopy (can't
see nano) and no evidence of coherent technology. Nano-and micro-junk is
not technology! A lot of this is just hydrogel curing and decomposing.
That it makes some regular looking structures is not a proof of anything
other than don't inject this crap. Now that John Campbell is promoting
it, this confirms that it's a red herring, a distraction. He never
speaks about real threats, at least not when they matter. His channel is
heavily supported/promoted by someone behind this whole crime and he is
a puppet."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1832422894799819219>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>sasha_<wbr>latypova/<wbr>status/<wbr>1832422894799819219</a>]
I pointed out to her that she had promoted similar stories of scary
structures found under a microscope by David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and
Mat Taylor, and that she wrote that <span class="quote">"Mat Taylor is a
true natural scientist in the original sense of the word"</span> and
that his <span class="quote">"approach to understanding what is going on
with covid injections is a valid one"</span>, but she said that <span
class="quote">"Yes, I wrote this and I stand by this, as Matt did a lot
of good observational work and at least at the time was careful about
making grandiose claims that <span class="quote">'nanotechnology'</span>
cult members are not making."</span> However it's interesting that she
said that she was in the same Signal group with the authors. When she
interviewed Shimon Yanowitz in 2022, Yanowitz also said that they had a
mutual friend in South Korea, which probably meant Youngmi Lee.</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy's ResearchGate profile makes it look like he is an
expert in propaganda rather than science:

<p>Daniel Broudy is based in Okinawa and he used to work for the US
military, but Okinawa is basically one big American military base. Many
of his scholarly articles have dealt with the American military presence
in Okinawa:

<p>Masako Ganaha is also from Okinawa, and before she became an
anti-vaxxer, she hosted a radio program that was mainly focused on
criticizing opponents of the American military presence in Okinawa. She
said her dream job was to become an FBI agent.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masako_Ganaha>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Masako_<wbr>Ganaha</a>]
She traveled to the United States in late 2020 to cover the US
presidential election, so she happened to attend January 6th.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/@masakoganaha/streams>https://<a
href="mailto:www.youtube.com/@masakoganaha"
class="email">www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/@<wbr>masakoganaha</a>/streams</a>] She has
done many videos in person with the US former Special Forces member
Michael Yon, and she has done videos with other American controlled
opposition characters, like the former Special Forces member Matt
Bracken, Mike Adams, Candace Owens, Emerald Robinson from MyPillow TV,
Joshua Phillipp from the Epoch Times show Crossroads. In 2023 Masako
Ganaha was interviewed by the former naval intelligence agent Jack
Posobiec about the CCP's influence in Japan.

She also appeared on Falun Gong's TV channel NTD in 2020, and she has
contributed articles to the Moonie newspaper Sekai Nippo.</p>
<p>It's also interesting that Broudy is a professor at a Christian
college, because Christian organizations have served as a front for
western intelligence in East Asia. Many people in Miles Guo's movement
are also Christians. During an interview with Died Suddenly, Broudy's
Korean coauthor Youngmi Lee also said that she was a Christian.
[<a href=https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1825892636936241392>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>DiedSuddenly_/<wbr>status/<wbr>1825892636936241392</a>]
There have been a several cults in East Asian countries which have mixed
elements of Christianity with western conspiracy culture, like the
Unification Church, Miles Guo's movement, the Japanese Pana-Wave cult,
and Raelianism (which attained the second-most popularity in Japan after
its home country of France).</p>
<p>When I searched for tweets about Youngmi Lee, most of the tweets were
posted either by accounts that promoted Miles Guo or accounts that
posted about western conspiracy topics in East Asian languages.

One of the accounts posted in Chinese but didn't post about Miles Guo,
but its header graphic was about the Judeo-Christian Bible:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-14.jpg width=1000>

<p>The first interview that Lee and Broudy did about their paper was on
the Died Suddenly podcast. Died Suddenly also posted a tweet about the
paper which got over 8 million views (which featured one video clip of
Richard Hirschman and another video clip of a panel by Ana Mihalcea, Mat
Taylor, David Nixon, and Shimon Yanowitz).

<p>Daniel Broudy wrote an article published by PANDA and he did a video
presentation for PANDA.

PANDA.

Daniel Broudy is one of three co-editors of Synesthesia Journal, whose
review board includes Piers Robinson.

The third editor of Propaganda in Focus is Mark Crispin Miller, whose
bio says that he used to teach courses on propaganda at New York
University and that he has received a grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-4.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>The War of the Worlds broadcast was orchestrated by psychologists
from New York under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The
Rockefeller Archive published an article about the broadcast, which
mentioned that the authors of the broadcast later received another grant
to research the public reaction to the broadcast: <span
class="quote">"In his grant proposal, Cantril identified the public
reaction to the War of the Worlds broadcast as <span class="quote">'an
almost unparalleled source of data'</span> for those interested in
understanding the impact of radio on mass movements. It would also be of
use to educators troubled by what the response to the broadcast suggests
about <span class="quote">'critical thinking and propaganda.'</span> It
was a persuasive argument for program officers seeking to understand
more clearly how propaganda works, and how to better educate Americans
in media literacy."</span>
[<a href=https://resource.rockarch.org/story/war-of-the-worlds-rockefeller-philanthropies-disinformation-and-media-literacy-in-the-1930s/>https://<wbr>resource.<wbr>rockarch.<wbr>org/<wbr>story/<wbr>war-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>worlds-<wbr>rockefeller-<wbr>philanthropies-<wbr>disinformation-<wbr>and-<wbr>media-<wbr>literacy-<wbr>in-<wbr>the-<wbr>1930s/<wbr></a>]
So I wonder if modern-day researchers of propaganda similarly release
propaganda themselves in order to study how the public audience reacts
to propaganda.</p>
<p>IJVTPR also published two papers about nanotechnology in COVID
vaccines coauthored by Daniel Broudy and Valerie Kyrie.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>49</a>,

Kyrie's bio says that her doctoral thesis focused on the topic of
reality perception and its manipulation: <span class="quote">"With a PhD
in Experimental Psychology, Masters in Clinical Psychology, Kyrie is
working in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of
atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management. Her
doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and
its manipulation."</span> The other paper said: <span class="quote">"The
impetus for this cross-disciplinary study was current reports from a
substantial proportion of injected subjects who emitted alphanumeric
signals in the frequency range corresponding to Bluetooth communications
networks. [...] The <span class="quote">'vaccines'</span> (hereafter,
<span class="quote">'platforms'</span>) are at the very center of the
construction of a global network of communications needed for the
commodification of objects and bodies (Sinclair et al., 2019). [...] With
researchers and practitioners around the world reporting undeclared and
apparently bizarrely (bio)mechanical nano-contents in COVID-19
injections (Anonymous, 2022a; Anonymous 2022b; Botha, 2021; Campra,

2021; Yanowitz, 2022; Young, 2021), combined with reports of apparent
Bluetooth connectivity in the vaccinated (Sarlangue et al., 2021), a set
of possibilities anchored in relevant scientific literatures has been
proposed."</span>

<p>The senior editor of IJVTPR is Christopher Shaw, who is also listed
as an author at Propaganda in Focus.

<p>During an interview with Ana Mihalcea, Youngmi Lee first emphasized
that the photos she showed were taken with an optical microscope so
nano-scale structures were not visible. But then she showed the photos
below from her paper and said: <span class="quote">"These structures are
conformed as magnetic nanobot, you know. I saw same structures - exactly
the same structure, at 2016 paper - I don't remember the paper name -
and cited in our paper as 2019 paper. Anyway, both of papers confirmed
these structures are from magnetic nanobots."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html?start=2067>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v5byv09-<wbr>millions-<wbr>of-<wbr>self-<wbr>assembly-<wbr>nanoparticles-<wbr>in-<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>injections-<wbr>ep-<wbr>33.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=2067</a>]
So because a micro-scale structure had a similar shape as a nano-scale
structure, she was able to deduce that the micro-scale structure was
composed of nanotechnology. Because I guess nanotechnology works like
some kind of a mandelbrot set, where larger structures are composed of
smaller structures which have a similar shape as the larger
structures:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-6.jpg width=600>

<p>Next she showed the slide below which featured a real image of a
microalgae-based biohybrid robot, but then she compared it to the
helical structure shown on the right and she said: <span
class="quote">"I didn't know that what is it. But our member Lisa - you
know Lisa, you remember? Yeah, Lisa noticed, Lisa from - macronanobot.
So whoa! Surprise! Amazing! I found macronanobot from my incubation
study with Pfizer, you know."</span> [36:44]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-7.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>There were zero hits on Google Search for the word <span
class="quote">"macronanobot"</span>, which sounds like an oxymoron.</p>
<p>The papers from 2016 and 2019 which Lee referred to were also cited
in the paper she wrote with Daniel Broudy, which said: <span
class="quote">"Our culture studies revealed that the Pfizer products in
simple distilled water produced a variety of transparent ribbons, thin
film-like membranes, coils, and spirals even without exposure to special
supplements or ambient energy sources. These patterns of growth and
appearance in the culture media could not be explained apart from
mechanisms of action peculiar to nanotechnology (Cao,
<a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201901849>2019</a>;
Truong et al.,
<a href=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/py/c6py00639f>2016</a>)."</span>
I didn't find any images of spiral-like structures in either paper
though.</p>
<p>The paper by Lee and Broudy said that the spiral structure was <span
class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like"</span>: <span class="quote">"Nearing
the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity
- after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days - specific algae-type
magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils, dark irregular spirals, appeared
near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14)."</span> But I guess it's good
enough if the coils are nano-robot-like even though they're on a
completely different scale than nanobots.</p>
<p>Lee and Broudy also wrote that they analyzed skin samples of a
patient with a variety of Morgellons disease: <span
class="quote">"During the initial period of incubation, skin extracts (a
variety of Morgellons) from an injected subject were placed in normal
saline. The donor of the extracts was a patient suffering from the side
effects of a paralytic seizure sustained just days after injection of
the mRNA experimental product. Her specimens from the Moderna injectable
were anonymized and coded as Extract 1 (E1). During the initial
examination of the skin extract, surrounding particles appeared and
seemed to exhibit a symbiotic relationship through direct observation
under the stereomicroscope. After one month incubation of E1, enough
seed-shaped particles, less than 1 μm in their largest dimension,
sufficiently developed in size were observed floating and moving around
the main portion of the skin extract in the saline solution of the
culture dish."</span> In a video in 2022, Shimon Yanowitz also told
Sasha Latypova that his blood contained an entity that might have been a
Morgellons filament, and it looked very mean and it made red blood cells
nervous.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>9ZFHWKEYxlCa/<wbr></a>,
9:21] Lee and Broudy cited the video as a source in a paragraph of their
paper where they wrote it was a fact that COVID vaccines include
nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The policy of the IJVTPR journal says: <span class="quote">"Citations

lack a peer-review process or that are known to publish researchers with

However the paper by Lee and Broudy cited 5 Rumble videos, 2 BitChute
videos, drsambailey.com, anamariamihalceamdphd.substack.com,
karenkingston.substack.com, and thehighwire.com, but none of those
sources were was critiqued or flagged as unreliable.</p>
<hr />
<p>The People's Voice published an article about Lee and Broudy's paper
titled <span class="quote">"Japan Declares State of Emergency After

However the main text of the article didn't say anything about Japan

<p>The avatars of two of the three users look AI-generated. The account
on the left portrays a black man from Ghana who posts a large number of
tweets about American political topics for some reason. It had posted
about 40,000 tweets by September 2024 but its oldest tweet returned by
the search was from July 2024 (even though that might be if it had
changed its username in July 2024, because when you search Twitter for
tweets posted by a certain username, it doesn't return tweets that the
same user posted under a different username).
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AJA_strategist%20until%3A2024-7-18&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=from%<wbr>3AJA_<wbr>strategist%<wbr>20until%<wbr>3A2024-<wbr>7-<wbr>18&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
If you look at the left side of his avatar image, the ear and shoulder
look too blurred compared to the face or to the curtain on the
background (unless the blur was produced by some kind of a digital
effect and it wasn't real blur produced by the lens of the camera). But
the face in general has the kind of overal blurry appearance as
AI-generated 3D images. The avatar of the white man looks even more
clearly fake, and the tufts of hair on the left side of the photo are
also highly blurred compared to the front of the face:</p>

</div>
<p>The display name of the other account is Steabhán Mac Giolla
Riabhaigh, which would probably be the name of only a single person in
the world if he was a real person. But when I googled for the name, all
of the results seemed to be about either the Twitter account or about
two YouTube channels which only had a couple of short videos.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/&#x40;SteabhanMac3/videos>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/@<wbr>SteabhanMac3/<wbr>videos</a>,

The newest video on the other channel was a video by Stew Peters.</p>
<p>A thread about the TPV article was posted by this account that posts
in Turkish and that seems to primarily post about flat earth:

<p>Tweets about the paper were also posted by IlluminatiCoin, John
O'Looney, nikola 3, Sudden And Unexpected, Concerned Citizen, Kim
Dotcom, and Alex Jones, which are all accounts that are frequently
reposted by bots that promote content about COVID from the controlled
alt media:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-13.jpg width=1400>

<p>I also tried searching for tweets about Daniel Broudy from the days
after he was interviewed by Died Suddenly.

One of the earliest tweets I found was posted by this account that posts
in Chinese:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-16.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>When I scraped the most recent retweets and quote tweets by the
Chinese account up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped
loading more tweets, it had reposted almost no Chinese accounts, but all
of the accounts it had reposted at least 6 times tweeted in English.
[<a href=https://x.com/lex_is_lex%5f>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>lex_<wbr>is_<wbr>lex%<wbr>5f</a>] They
included accounts like the flat earther health guru David Wolfe whose
account is probably a bot or a human-bot hybrid.
[<a href=bot2.html#David_Avocado_Wolfe>bot2.<wbr>html#<wbr>David_<wbr>Avocado_<wbr>Wolfe</a>]
And they also included iluminatibot, redpillb0t, and thehealthb0t, which
are overtly presented as bots and which post tweets from the same

<p>About a month after Lee and Broudy's paper had been published, the
IJVTPR journal published a commentary on the paper by Anne Ulrich, who
is the chair of biochemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
She wrote:
[<a href=https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/106/321>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>106/<wbr>321</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has long been known in the field of biophysics that all of the
intriguing geometries described here by Lee and Broudy (2024) can emerge
naturally from lipid preparations, as are used in the modRNA
vaccinations in the form of lipid nanoparticles. They may show up
especially when samples are stored over extended periods - or under
inappropriate conditions. The astonishing μm-sized architectures can be
explained by a simple physical process called lipid self-assembly.
Notably, lipids make up the bulk of the vaccine ingredients, in other
words, 2.5 mg/ml (one quarter of which is cholesterol), compared to a
mere 0.1 mg/ml modRNA, in the presence of about 100 mg/ml sucrose and
salts (as declared for ready-to-use Comirnaty/BNT162b2). Therefore,
instead of seeking an explanation for the strange objects in terms of
exotic additives, it is more plausible to start looking at the materials
that are already known to be abundantly present in the injectable
formulations.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In fresh modRNA preparations or samples that have been stored
properly, no objects should be visible under an optical microscope,
because the original nanoparticles with a diameter of around 55 nm are
well below the resolution limit of 200 nm (Unruh et al., 2024).
According to the manufacturer, the unopened injectable suspensions are
stable for up to 10 weeks in a refrigerator. However, if they are stored
for longer times or at higher temperatures, or are subjected to
freeze-thawing, dilution, agitation, different salt concentrations or pH
values, they can break down progressively. The delicate RNA chains are
generally sensitive to hydrolysis by acids, bases, bacteria, and enzymes
(for example, trace amounts of ribonuclease on the human skin), as well
as to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen. Lipids can also decompose
chemically in similar ways. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the
Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna injectables are in fact quite stable towards
physical stressors for up to 8 days. However, the cholesterol and RNA
contained therein are photosensitive and tend to get oxidized under
irradiation corresponding to bright sunlight (Fongaro et al., 2023). As
a result of any such degradation process, the lipids will rearrange in
new ways once they have lost their cohesion due to fragmentation of the
RNA chains or due to any change in the molecular composition of the
sample.</p>
<p>It is commonly accepted that the physical shapes and sizes of lipid
nanoparticles (especially in combination with RNA or DNA) tend to be
only meta-stable. This means that the particles are kinetically trapped
and have not yet reached their lowest energy state thermodynamically. As
a consequence, time-dependent changes in their morphological appearance
would be expected simply upon letting them stand. It is important to
note that Lee and Broudy (2024) not only incubated their material for
extended periods of up to 12 months; but, in fact, they diluted some
samples with distilled water or blood plasma. To other samples they
added oxidants like H2O2 or ClO2, or they mixed them with some
electrolyte solutions, or various colloidal/mineral suspensions. Any
changes in the aqueous environment, as well the addition of low
molecular weight compounds, proteins or colloids, can dramatically
affect the stability of nanoparticles. Under the diverse experimental
conditions that were used, a regrouping of the lipids into other types
of structures is not at all surprising.</p>
<p>A lipid mixture can often take on several different phase states
and/or structural shapes, as is conveniently displayed in a
phase-diagram, usually as a function of temperature and water content.
But other parameters, too, have an influence of the phase behaviour of
lipid systems, such as the component ratios, salt, pH, additives,
pressure, etc., many of which will have been affected under the
different experimental conditions. It is obvious that some molecular
phase separation or de-mixing has taken place in some of the incubated
vaccine samples, allowing the poorly water-soluble cholesterol to
crystallize out. This interpretation can fully explain the appearance of
the sharp-edged platelets and angular chips (top left corner of Figure
1), which have already been attributed to cholesterol crystals (or even
simple salt) in earlier discussions cited by Lee and Broudy (2024).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The McCullough Foundation caught a lot of flak after they tweeted a
link to Lee and Broudy's paper, but they later deleted the tweet and
posted a link to the rebuttal by Anne Ulrich instead.

<p>In 2022 IJVTPR published a paper by David Hughes titled <span
class="quote">"What Is in the So-called COVID-19 <span
class="quote">'Vaccines'</span>? Part 1: Evidence of a Global Crime
Against Humanity"</span>. The paper featured images of microchips by La
Quinta Columna and images of hydras by Carrie Madej:
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>52/<wbr>288</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-17.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>David Hughes also writes for Propaganda in Focus, where his bio says
that he lectures in security studies and his areas of research include
<span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span
class="quote">"the class relations behind psychological
operations"</span>:
[<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://<wbr>propagandainfocus.<wbr>com/<wbr>our-<wbr>team/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-18.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>So IJVTPR has published papers about nanotechnology in COVID shots by
at least 3 different people who are all specialized in researching
propaganda or psychological operations, who are Daniel Broudy, Valerie
Kyrie, and David Hughes. The team of three propagandists has also
written articles that were published by Solari Report and Unlimited
Hangout:
[<a href=https://researchmap.jp/d_broudy?lang=en>https://<wbr>researchmap.<wbr>jp/<wbr>d_<wbr>broudy?<wbr>lang=en</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-19.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In the article published in Solari Report, the authors wrote that
<span class="quote">"we have prepared a video summary of our article,
which was presented as part of the Doctors for Covid Ethics Fifth
Symposium in December 2022"</span>:
[<a href=https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/>https://<wbr>constitution.<wbr>solari.<wbr>com/<wbr>global-<wbr>class-<wbr>war-<wbr>and-<wbr>the-<wbr>politics-<wbr>of-<wbr>a-<wbr>hatchet-<wbr>job-<wbr>a-<wbr>reply-<wbr>to-<wbr>john-<wbr>waters/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-20.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Doctors for COVID Ethics is kind of a shady organization, and earlier
on this page I pointed out how Latypova and Yeadon have been speakers in
their symposiums, and in 2022 before Latypova had her own Substack, D4CE
published a long article by her. The paper by Lee and Broudy cited four
different videos by Shimon Yanowitz, but one of them was a presentation
he did for Doctors for COVID Ethics:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-21.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Not surprisingly, David Hughes claims that the pandemic was fake,
because he wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19
pandemic'</span> was a Big Lie: there is no credible epidemiological
evidence to support its existence. Rather, the <span
class="quote">'pandemic'</span> was a media-driven social phenomenon
that served to deflect attention from far-reaching technocratic agendas
being advanced across every area of life."</span>

He also wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19
pandemic'</span> was, in the view of Kyrie and Broudy (2022a), conjured
out of <span class="quote">'mass hysteria, malpractice, censorship and
juggled data.'</span>"</span></p>

It's often a red flag when someone in alt media has ties to a foreign
country or they have lived in a foreign country, like how Reiner
Fullmich and Sucharit Bhakdi both used to live in the United States, but
they now seem to be responsible for importing US-produced disinformation
to Europe.</p>

</h2>
<p>In order to gauge whether people in alternative media are controlled
opposition or sincere truth tellers, one way is to look at which
channels or shows did their earliest interviews. If it happens to be
something like the Stew Peters Show like in the case of Latypova, then
the people are probably not sincere.</p>
<p>In the table below, I tried to find the earliest video or audio
interviews that people mentioned on this page did in alt media. I tried
to find UTC dates when possible, but some dates are in an uknown
timezone. Out of the people in my table, J.J. Couey and David Martin
started posting videos on their own YouTube channel before their
earliest interview listed here.</p>

<a href=#Stews_lawsuit_against_Lauren_Witzke_and_sponsorship_by_Goldco id=Stews_lawsuit_against_Lauren_Witzke_and_sponsorship_by_Goldco>Stew's
lawsuit against Lauren Witzke and sponsorship by Goldco</a>
</h2>
<p>In April 2024 Stew Peters tweeted: <span class="quote">"The <span
class="citation" data-cites="DiedSuddenly_">@DiedSuddenly_</span>
account has been hijacked by <span class="citation"
data-cites="LaurenWitzkeDE">@LaurenWitzkeDE</span> et al and is
currently not being run by the Stew Peters Network."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>realstewpeters/<wbr>status/<wbr>1776687243760918915</a>]
Around the same time he filed a lawsuit against Lauren Witzke's
production company TLM Global, which he had hired to produce his show
and films.
[<a href=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>courtlistener.<wbr>com/<wbr>docket/<wbr>68403646/<wbr>fokiss-<wbr>inc-<wbr>v-<wbr>tlm-<wbr>global-<wbr>llc/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>An article about the lawsuit said:
[<a href=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire>https://<wbr>talkingpointsmemo.<wbr>com/<wbr>news/<wbr>lawsuit-<wbr>exposes-<wbr>internal-<wbr>feuds-<wbr>and-<wbr>inner-<wbr>workings-<wbr>of-<wbr>stew-<wbr>peters-<wbr>extremist-<wbr>media-<wbr>empire</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial complaint, which notes that Fokiss is doing business as
the Stew Peters Network, accuses the TLM team of making <span
class="quote">"unauthorized donation solicitations"</span> on a website
associated with <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly."</span> Fokiss'
complaint also alleged all of the defendants made <span
class="quote">"improper"</span> applications for trademarks associated
with the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> brand. The court
filing also includes a copy of a termination letter that Peters
apparently sent to Szall on January 27, 2024 in an attempt to end their
business relationship. That letter describes the <span
class="quote">"ownership confusion of the <span class="quote">'DIED
SUDDENLY'</span> name, twitter page, and documentary"</span> along with
<span class="quote">"unapproved postings, fundraisers, and even
subscription sign ups"</span> that Peters called <span
class="quote">"unacceptable"</span> and even <span
class="quote">"criminal."</span></p>
<p>Despite these concerns Peters indicated in the letter a willingness
to continue to work with Szall, Witzke, and TLM. Peters specified that
Crosstalk <span class="quote">"may continue to air on the SPN."</span>
He also discussed the terms for this, which he indicated were part of a
separate <span class="quote">"contract."</span> The deal outlined by
Peters in the letter indicated that <span
class="quote">"Crosstalk"</span> was fully produced by TLM and then
delivered to his company on the afternoon it was aired. He wrote that
TLM needed to pay $1,600 monthly to air on the network. The exchange
indicates that, at least in this case, Peters charged other hosts to
make content for his network, which offered them the benefit of exposure
to his following. Peters also wrote that TLM had an <span
class="quote">"ongoing obligation to complete and deliver ... the
remaining two documentaries"</span> for which he said they were already
<span class="quote">"paid in full for by the Stew Peters
Network."</span></p>
<p>The complaint details the amount TLM was paid to make documentaries
for Peters. It also identified Goldco, a relatively mainstream company
that helps clients invest in gold and other precious metals as the
primary funder of the Stew Peters Network and its documentaries.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Goldco had two sponsorship agreements
with Peters' company that ran from April 2022 to the end of last month.
He has continued to identify the company as a sponsor in more recent
broadcasts as well. The complaint described Goldco as providing <span
class="quote">"the majority of the Network's annual budgets and
production requirements."</span> Goldco and its CEO, Trevor Gerszt, did
not respond to questions from TPM about its role financing Peters'
network, and its extremist content.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Peters' company provided TLM a <span
class="quote">"documentary budget"</span> of $379,000 through two
separate payments last year that were <span class="quote">"generally
tied to the Plaintiff's obligations to the GoldCo Sponsorship
Agreement."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2024 on the Fresh and Fit podcast, one of the hosts asked Stew
Peters: <span class="quote">"Didn't you say in a lawsuit that you were
almost completely funded by a Jewish gold company Goldco?"</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v4x7str-stew-peters-meets-fresh-and-fit.html?start=2904>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v4x7str-<wbr>stew-<wbr>peters-<wbr>meets-<wbr>fresh-<wbr>and-<wbr>fit.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=2904</a>]
Then Stew answered: <span class="quote">"Could I say that I'm funded by
a Jewish gold company? Yeah, I am. I mean, Goldco is a great company.
They sponsored the film. So in essence I guess you could say that I'm
funded by these people. These people give me the funds to go create
material and content that I produce to the public for free. So, yeah, I
mean, I guess you could say that. The guy that owns Goldco, uh, says
that he's a Jew, so."</span> [clip at

<p>During the same podcast, Stew also said that Lauren Witzke had a fake
white nationalist persona: <span class="quote">"She's like this, um,
fake Christian white nationalist gal that has like this online presence
of being like, um, you know, Ms. Nick Fuentes kind of sort of. You know,
take all of his view points, carbon copy them, put them into her - her
online presence, that's her persona. Ok, but she's now like pregnant
with a Mexican who I think is gay, a brown baby, and she's like, <span
class="quote">'Yeah, whatev'</span>."</span> [time 54:25; clip at

<p>In the initial claim Stew Peters filed, he basically stated that he
was owned by Goldco:
[<a href=https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982.1.0.pdf>https://<wbr>storage.<wbr>courtlistener.<wbr>com/<wbr>recap/<wbr>gov.<wbr>uscourts.<wbr>flsd.<wbr>664982/<wbr>gov.<wbr>uscourts.<wbr>flsd.<wbr>664982.<wbr>1.<wbr>0.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>43. On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a sponsorship agreement
with GoldCo (the <span class="quote">"GoldCo Sponsorship
Agreement"</span>), a company that provides services in the precious
metals industry.</p>
<p>44. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, GoldCo and
Plaintiff worked out an annual budget for GoldCo's sponsorship of the
Network.</p>
<p>45. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, Plaintiff had
certain requirements it had to meet such as mentioning GoldCo as a
sponsor throughout its Network and also producing and releasing a
certain amount of documentaries during each GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement
contractual term.</p>
<p>46. The initial GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement term commenced on April
28, 2022 and ended on April 28, 2023 (the <span class="quote">"Initial
Term"</span>).</p>
<p>47. Since the Initial Term, Plaintiff and GoldCo have renewed the
GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement for a second term (the <span
class="quote">"Second Term"</span>), which commenced on April 28, 2023
and is set to expire on April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>48. While GoldCo is not a party to this action, the GoldCo
Sponsorship Agreement is a vital piece to the relationship, duties, and
responsibilities of the parties hereto because the GoldCo Sponsorship
Agreement, and the requirements therein, provided the majority of the
Network's annual budgets and production requirements.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>53 . Both Plaintiff and TLMG understood that their Agreement
regarding Network Production and Documentary Production and the
obligations therein were generally tied to the Plaintiff's obligations
to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement because GoldCo provided the majority
of the budget for the production of the Network and also because the
GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement had strict requirements regarding the
number of documentaries that would be released by Plaintiff in each
contract term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023 when Stew Peters was attacked by Media Matters because of his
antisemititism, Lauren Witzke posted a tweet that said <span
class="quote">"Support Stew from this slanderous attack and buy gold
here: goldco.com/stew"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709576077771706637>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>LaurenWitzkeDE/<wbr>status/<wbr>1709576077771706637</a>]
She also posted a tweet that said <span class="quote">"Media Matters
will be hearing from our very vicious and money hungry Jewish
lawyer!"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709579540710797680>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>LaurenWitzkeDE/<wbr>status/<wbr>1709579540710797680</a>]</p>
<p>Goldco's founder said <span class="quote">"As a young boy in South
Africa, I would get silver dollars on birthdays and Jewish
holidays"</span>, and he said <span class="quote">"I would look at these
older coins and was amazed. I would savor them and collect them."</span>
[<a href=https://calbizjournal.com/gold-standard/>https://<wbr>calbizjournal.<wbr>com/<wbr>gold-<wbr>standard/<wbr></a>]
But I guess it's just a canard that these people have a lust for gold
and silver.</p>
<p>One of Jane Ruby's main sponsors is Augusta Gold &amp; Silver, whose
CEO and founder is Isaac Nuriani, who is probably also a Jew, because he
is related to people with Jewish names like Moshe Nuriani.

<p>In 2021 van Kessel said that people with two doses won't live longer
than 5 years, and he said that vaccines contain nanobots and graphene:
[<a href=https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/advocaat-arno-van-kessel-wil-rutte-voor-de-rechter>https://<wbr>pointer.<wbr>kro-<wbr>ncrv.<wbr>nl/<wbr>advocaat-<wbr>arno-<wbr>van-<wbr>kessel-<wbr>wil-<wbr>rutte-<wbr>voor-<wbr>de-<wbr>rechter</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel believes that Bill Gates will control us remotely through
the vaccines. <span class="quote">"Honestly, believe me, I'm not a fool.
We're going to be controlled remotely. Everyone who gets that shot is
going to be screwed. You'll become half robot, half human. That's what
happens with nanotechnology, and nanotechnology exists. The patents are
real. If you had told me this two years ago, I would have said: you're
crazy. But after all the research we've done... I'm not crazy. I'm a
lawyer."</span></p>
<p>Gates has never said he wants to kill the world's population with
vaccines. But Van Kessel insists. He claims the nanomaterial graphene
oxide, an often-debunked conspiracy theory, is in the vaccines to kill
people. <span class="quote">"If you've had two shots, I'm convinced you
won't live longer than five years. And you do nothing about
it."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel seems to be a sovereign citizenship guy, because he said
that Mark Rutte was not really the prime minister of Netherlands, but
rather the director of a company called the State of the Netherlands
that was registered in Washington DC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel says during the investigation he discovered a global
conspiracy between the Freemasons and the Rockefeller Foundation, who
want to form a single world government: The New World Order . He also
claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been tasked with decimating
the world population through coronavirus vaccines. The United Nations is
said to be invoking Satan and relaying the Rockefeller Foundation's
orders to the World Health Organization and the RIVM (National Institute
for Public Health and the Environment). These orders would ultimately
end up with caretaker Prime Minister Rutte and the various
ministers.</p>
<p>We think Rutte is our prime minister, says Van Kessel. But according
to him, that's not the case. <span class="quote">"I'm pretty convinced
that everything is perception, everything is fiction. What's going on?
In our perception, Mark Rutte has the title of prime minister of the
Netherlands. In reality, he has the title of a company, director of the
State of the Netherlands. Registered in Washington, DC. And he signed an
important contract."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In June 2025 van Kessel was arrested by the Dutch anti-terrorism unit
DSI because he was suspected of being involved in a criminal network:
[<a href=https://bvs.nl/column-in-english/>https://<wbr>bvs.<wbr>nl/<wbr>column-<wbr>in-<wbr>english/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simultaneously with a number of sovereigns, lawyer Arno van Kessel
from Leeuwarden was also arrested on 11 June just before the NATO summit
by 15 members of the Special Intervention Service (DSI) in the presence
of the examining magistrate and the dean of the Bar Association of the
Northern Netherlands (as is customary with lawyers because of their
right to refuse to testify). The dean started a suspension procedure
shortly afterwards, without access to details of the case, which raises
questions about the independence and care of this step.</p>
<p>On 26 June 2025, Van Kessel's pre-trial detention was extended by 90
days on suspicion of involvement in a <span class="quote">"criminal
network"</span> with <span class="quote">"anti-institutional
ideology"</span> that may have wanted to collect or use weapons or
dangerous substances, possibly in connection with the NATO summit of
24-25 June 2025 in The Hague.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An announcement by the Dutch police said: <span class="quote">"The
investigation by the police and Public Prosecution Service in the
Northern Netherlands focuses on a criminal network in which a large
proportion of the arrested suspects adhere to anti-institutional
ideology and may have the intention to use violence. [...] In addition to
the arrests, searches were conducted in various locations in the
Netherlands. [...] Weapons and ammunition, narcotics, possible explosives,
and potentially hazardous substances were found and seized."</span>

<p>Baxter Dmitry reported that van Kessel was facing euthanasia by a
massive death chamber:

<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-euthanasia.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>However I don't know if the arrests were just a publicity stunt to
draw more attention to the court case. One article said this in Dutch:
<span class="quote">"During an earlier arrest of a couple from
Geesteren, the police also claimed that explosives had been found. In
reality, it was an old box of fireworks that had been forgotten for
years in one of their sheds."</span>

<p>The audio and video production for Catherine Austin Fitts is done by
the Dutch people who used to organize the Secret Space Program
conspiracy conference. Fitts said: <span class="quote">"We have a
subsidiary in the Netherlands, uh Solari Europa, so I have a Dutch
partner, and it's 50/50, you know, myself and my Dutch partner. And that
group, they do all our audio, videos, extraordinary people. I met them
because during - from 2010 to now, they've been doing conferences on
breakthrough energy and the secret space program. And their breakthrough
energy group is called GlobalBEM. It's up on the internet, you can see
all their presentations. [...] Breakthrough Energy Movement is what it
stands for. And, you know, they have a website, and they publish all the
stuff. And I've participated in some of the conferences."</span>

<p>After Latypova did her alt media debut on the Stew Peters Show, I
belive the next two people who interviewed her were Willem Engel from
the Dutch organization Viruswaarheid, and J.J. Couey who used to live in
the Netherlands. The first non-solo videos Couey did in alt media were
panels hosted by George Webb's mini-me Addy Adds:
<a href=clot2.html#Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Cottrell_Couey_Kulacz_and_Webb>clot2.<wbr>html#<wbr>Kevin_<wbr>McCairns_<wbr>connection_<wbr>to_<wbr>Cottrell_<wbr>Couey_<wbr>Kulacz_<wbr>and_<wbr>Webb</a>.
The panels also featured Paul Cottrell who was George Webb's go-to guy
on COVID biology. George Webb has said that he used to work with Dutch
intelligence in New York, and he wrote a book about Erasmus Medical
Center which is where Couey worked. Webb used to be the sidekick of
Jason Goodman, whose current sidekick John Cullen speaks Dutch.</p>
<p>(I don't know if any of these Dutch connections are relevant to why
Fitts or Latypova were selected as the witnesses in the trial, but I
thought they were still worth mentioning.)</p>
<hr />
<p>One of van Kessel's expert witnesses is Joe Sansone, who runs a
hypnosis company where his services range from assisting his clients in
improving their golf game to helping them explore soul level changes:

<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-kassel-samsone.webp width=560>
</div>
<p>In 2024 Joseph Sansone filed a court case seeking to prohibit the
distribution of mRNA vaccines in Florida <span class="quote">"because
they are biological and technological weapons of mass
destruction"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/breaking-florida-lawsuit-seeks-injunction>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>josephsansone.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>breaking-<wbr>florida-<wbr>lawsuit-<wbr>seeks-<wbr>injunction</a>]
In his press release about the case he wrote that <span
class="quote">"Surgeon General Ladapo has publicly described the mRNA
injections as the <span class="quote">'Anti Christ'</span> of
drugs."</span> Affidavits to his case were provided by Francis Boyle,
Karen Kingston, Ana Mihalcea, Rima Laibow, Andrew Zywiec, Marivic Villa,
Avery Brinkley, Ben Marble, and Paul Alexander.</p>
<p>Francis Boyle was also going to testify in van Kessel's case but he
died in 2025. Sansone wrote: <span class="quote">"Yes I helped arrange
for Boyle to testify in Netherlands case. Been in contact with them over
a year."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/PhdSansone/status/1959267285064892715>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>PhdSansone/<wbr>status/<wbr>1959267285064892715</a>]
Some people were speculating that Francis Boyle was assassinated so that
he couldn't have testified in the trial. But Sansone wrote that at the
time Boyle died, it wasn't even public knowledge that he was going to
testify in the trial: <span class="quote">"I connected him with
attorneys. As far as I know nobody knew he was going to testify besides
myself and the attorneys. Maybe other witnesses. Unless my memory is off
I don't think the court even knew he was to testify yet."</span>

<p>Ben Marble tweeted in August 2025 that he thinks 1 billion people
will have died from COVID vaccines by January 1st 2026:
[<a href=https://x.com/BenMarblesX/status/1959420978599256494>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>BenMarblesX/<wbr>status/<wbr>1959420978599256494</a>]</p>

<p>Earlier in 2024 when Sansone filed a court case to ban COVID vaccines
in Florida, he went on Maria Zeee's show together with Karen Kingston to
discuss the case.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/karen-kingston-and-dr-joseph-sansone>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>josephsansone.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>karen-<wbr>kingston-<wbr>and-<wbr>dr-<wbr>joseph-<wbr>sansone</a>]
Sansone claimed that the crimes being committed against Floridians
included distribution, stockpiling, and use of weapons of biological
weapons (18 USC 175), distribution, stockpiling, and use of weapons of
mass destruction (FL 790.166), treason (18 USC 2381), domestic terrorism
(18 USC 2331), and genocide (18 USC 1091).

<p>Kingston's affidavit for the case said that <span class="quote">"I am
able to read and write"</span>, but after that it said <span
class="quote">"My Names is Karen Kingston"</span> and <span

<p>The earliest interview Sansone posted on his BitChute channel was an
interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea.

<p>Joe Sansone first fell under my radar because I noticed he did many
videos with people connected to calamari clots. The two earliest videos
of Laura Kasner I found on Rumble were both posted by Sansone.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/search/video?q=%22Laura%20Kasner%22&sort=date&page=2>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>search/<wbr>video?<wbr>q=%<wbr>22Laura%<wbr>20Kasner%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>sort=date&amp;<wbr>page=2</a>]
Sansone was also one of the first people who interviewed Andrew
Zywiec.</p>
<p>In 2023 Sansone was a speaker in a symposium held by Todd Callender's
organization VaxxChoice, which also featured Todd Callender (who says
the calamari clots are 5G antennas that contain hydras), Ana Mihalcea,
the DMED whistleblower Theresa Long (who supposedly discovered Richard
Hirschman by chance and connected him with Jane Ruby), the Qtard lady
Ann Vandersteel, and the DMED whistleblower Pete Chambers (who has said
he was <span class="quote">"right in the front seat of uh, doing what we
call, said, unconventional warfare, which - it has a heavy piece of
psychological, psyops, or information operations"</span>).

<p>Sansone also said that there's graphene in dental anesthetic, and
that <span class="quote">"Dr. Mihalcea has shown a lot if what looks
like self assembling technology in blood"</span>:

<p>Added in October 2025: Joe Sansone now broke the news that COVID
vaccines were declared to be bioweapons by the International Tribunal of
the Alliance of Indigenous Nations.
[<a href=fake.html#Alliance_of_Indigenous_Nations_declares_that_COVID_vaccines_are_bioweapons>fake.<wbr>html#<wbr>Alliance_<wbr>of_<wbr>Indigenous_<wbr>Nations_<wbr>declares_<wbr>that_<wbr>COVID_<wbr>vaccines_<wbr>are_<wbr>bioweapons</a>]
He said that the Alliance of Indigenous Nations issued the declaration
<span class="quote">"after reviewing hundreds of pages of evidence from
my current case"</span>. The declaration looked similar to the documents
of Sansone's court case in Florida, and it featured expert statements by
Francis Boyle, Ana Mihalcea, Andrew Zywiec, Paul Alexander, and Rima
Laibow, who all provided affidavits for Sansone's case.</p>
<p>The declaration was signed by someone called <span class="quote">"A
Leaping Ram"</span>, who is the Attorney General of AIN. He is a white
sovereign citizen guru called Glenn Bogue, who also calls himself <span
class="quote">"Spirit Warrior"</span>. He is a member of a fake Indian
nation run by white sovereign citizen gurus, which allows anyone to
become their member by paying an annual fee of 300 CAD. A Leaping Ram
has written a book called the <span class="quote">"Sacred Sex and the
Menopausal Woman"</span>, where he wrote that <span class="quote">"In
her Holy of Holies (her womb) the female is capable of producing the
wondrous Ormus molecule, which has the quantum capability to not only
reverse disease and raise intelligence; it can actually open the
Stargate to the Universe!"</span> He claims that he traveled through a
stargate from Sweden to Planet X. He says that humans were created
200,000 years ago, when a female scientist from Planet X inserted sperm
from Planet X into the egg of a bonobo, and on her way to the earth, she
also happened to carve the face on Mars.</p>
<p>Another member of AIN is Alfred Lambremont Webre, who wrote a book
with Glenn Bogue that was allegedly based on information leaked by time
travelers. Webre invited members of AIN to his international conference
on positive contact with Martian humans. He says there's about 1 million
Martians according to a time traveler who met one of the Martians. In
2020 when Webre acted as a judge in Sacha Stone's International Tribunal
for Natural Justice, he declared that SARS-CoV-2 was not a virus but an
exosome, which meant that all lockdown orders were null and void. In
2024 Sacha Stone said he was going to launch an operation called the
World Hereditary Council, where indigenous people would testify on
issues like the crimes of the Vatican, and he was looking forward to
working with AIN on the tribunals. Webre also had his own fake
international tribunal, called the <span class="quote">"Natural and
Common Law Tribunal for Public Health &amp; Justice"</span>. One of the
judges in Webre's tribunal was Rima Laibow, whose testimony was included
in AIN's declaration. In 2020 Webre's tribunal ordered a ban on 5G, all
vaccines, lockdown measures, and aspartame, and they sentenced Elon Musk
to 25 years in prison, and they sentenced Bill Gates and George Soros to
a life in prison.</p>
<p>Another person who signed AIN's declaration is someone called Lord
Frederick Stewart, who is an ambassador to a Papuan conman called King
David. King David ran a Ponzi scheme called U-Vistract, where he
promised his investors an interest rate of 100% per month. But after his
scheme collapsed, he fled the authorities to his home island, and he
declared himself to be the king of a new nation he established in his
hometown.</p>

Yanowitz interviewed by Latypova in April 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>In April 2022, Latypova published an interview of Shimon Yanowitz,
who presented microscope images of self-assembling structures he found
in vaccines.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/e9mvTko2Ts0T/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>e9mvTko2Ts0T/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>In the description of the video, Latypova wrote: <span
class="quote">"Self assembly of structures is evident. This demonstrates
clearly that the products are fraudulent and adulterated."</span> At
time 41:25, she also said: <span class="quote">"If we had honest
regulator, this would be forced to recall. Because the particles,
whatever particles, they're not supposed to be - they're not as product
described - there's not supposed to be any particles in there. But you
clearly have microscopic particles right from the start, and then they
assemble into these things. That's - it's a fraudulent, adulterated,
contaminated product that should be immediately recalled."</span> Were
the images shown by Yanowitz really the level of evidence she needed to
declare that the vaccines were contaminated and they should be
recalled?</p>
<p>At time 3:15, Latypova said: <span class="quote">"I'm talking to a
number of colleagues about starting an independent lab, probably
somewhere in the US, and we would be able to do these kinds of
experiments."</span></p>
<p>At time 16:14, Yanowitz pointed to the object I circled below, and he
said: <span class="quote">"And then we started taking images after - in
this case, just 20 to 30 minutes in the chamber - at room temperature,
so just, you know, 20, 25 degrees centigrade. And amazingly, these
started to behave like eggs, of which things started to
hatch."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 29:57, Yanowitz showed the image below and said: <span
class="quote">"These structures still have some pods or liposomes
connected to them. So I assume that these liposomes are going to give
off yet more material and nano robots that are clearly inside. The nano
robots could be made of DNA, but still they're nano robots."</span> But
Latypova just nodded and she didn't have anything critical to say to
Yanowitz:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 44:42, Yanowitz showed the image below and said: <span
class="quote">"This one, which again, it resembles, it looks like it has
a character of some electronic circuitry with antenna, whatever. If you
look at electronic integrated circuits, you'll see similar features.
Maybe not so angular - they tend to be more straight - but certainly
rectangular, okay."</span> But Latypova just said <span
class="quote">"uh-huh"</span>, even though she should've said the
structures don't look anything like electronic circuitry, but they look
like cholesterol:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 51:47, Latypova said: <span class="quote">"The part that you
said, you know, it looks like micro circuitry - I talked to - some
months ago - I talked to a person who is experienced in semiconductor
manufacturing, but from the quality perspective. He was doing a
statistical analysis for us on the batches, when we were looking at the
batch variability. And he mentioned at the time that - he detected
obviously huge variability, and he said this is not statistically
controlled process like it's supposed to be. And then he also mentioned
- if you've seen the work of La Quinta Columna, the Spanish group that
was looking at the microscopic things - and he said, <span
class="quote">'Oh, well, I remember this from my semiconductor
manufacturing time, you know, when we were trying to reverse engineer
some competitor's chip, we would throw it into acid. And these little
structures, the way they look, looks almost like that, like the
microchip that was thrown into acid to remove to see the circuitry and
to see the design.'</span>"</span> Then Yanowitz replied: <span
class="quote">"So by coincidence, since I come from electrical
engineering, I spent a large part of my career, both in microscopy and
in semiconductor inspection. And I know how semiconductor fabrication
processes look like, and this is very reminiscent of that."</span></p>
<p>At time 54:16, Yanowitz said: <span class="quote">"We know that
magnetic graphene oxide is being loaded on us, by the food industry, by
the soft drink - people have - I did the experiment myself. Um, you do
electrolysis of some mineral water, and you see dropping particles, and
with a magnet you can just - people have stuck magnets not only to their
shoulders, but to packages of meat in the supermarket. We are loaded,
spraying from the air, with many materials, some of them are magnetic,
some are not."</span> But Latypova just said <span
class="quote">"uh-huh"</span> and <span class="quote">"wow"</span> and
<span class="quote">"yeah"</span>.</p>
<p>At time 1:10:05, Latypova told Yanowitz: <span class="quote">"You
collaborate with some really good and intelligent and brave
people."</span> Earlier in the video Yanowitz mentioned that he had
collaborated with La Quinta Columna.</p>
<hr />
<p>During an interview David Hughes did with Ana Mihalcea, he showed the
image below and said: <span class="quote">"Now, when Mat Taylor showed
these images to an nanotech engineer, the engineer said, <span
class="quote">'What kind of circuit is that?'</span> Okay - haven't told
him it's anything to do with the vaccines - it was immediately
interpreted as circuitry. Similarly, Shimon Yanowitz is an electrical
engineer, and he says that from an engineer's - an electrical engineer's
perspective - there's no way to interpret this as anything other than
circuitry."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1sm3bm-what-is-in-the-so-called-covid-19-vaccines-evidence-of-a-global-crime-again.html?start=29m47s>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v1sm3bm-<wbr>what-<wbr>is-<wbr>in-<wbr>the-<wbr>so-<wbr>called-<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>vaccines-<wbr>evidence-<wbr>of-<wbr>a-<wbr>global-<wbr>crime-<wbr>again.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=29m47s</a>]
So it's interesting how both Latypova and Mat Taylor are supposed to
have shown their microscope images to an engineer who thought the images
displayed some kind of circuits.</p>

<p>In April 2025 on the Jane Ruby Show, Latypova talked about chemtrails
and the analysis of Jane Ruby's chemtrail fog by Mike Adams. Latypova
has speculated that the symptoms attributed to COVID might in reality
caused by some unspecific <span class="quote">"poison"</span>. But she
now said that she first came up with her poison theory after she and her
husband drove through a weird fog and got sick: <span class="quote">"And
like those fog events, actually, the weird fog events, they're
significant. Because I remember when I got COVID - whatever the COVID
was - it was after we drove through a humongous fog event. It was
something out of this world. I've never seen anything like this. And you
know, I've been on the Pacific coast. The fog is a very common thing
here. This was - you could like cut it with a knife. You could not see
like - if you extend your arm, you could not see your arm anymore. It
was epic. And right after we drove through that cloud for an hour or so,
we came home several hours later, both me and my husband were just gone.
I mean, it was really neurological. This loss of taste of smell,
migraine, it wasn't like it was not even coughing, but it was just the
poisoning. You know, that's when I started thinking that, oh, well, it
might be a neurotoxin. It's not really a virus. I don't think
so."</span>

So she gave the impression that she might have driven through the same
type of mystery fog that was sampled by Jane Ruby.</p>
<p>At time 8:30, Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"I get hundreds and
hundreds of messages a week from all over the country and the world. And
there's a pattern forming in what people are talking about, that after a
fog or after - sort of a chemtrail attack where they see the skies
crisscross, then it gets clear. After that clear - in the clearing time
period, people are reporting sick with flu, and respiratory emergencies,
and difficulty breathing, and - but like you said - flu symptoms that
you might call a pandemic."</span> Apparently Ruby and Latypova are
trying to bring back miasma theory.</p>
<p>In 2024 Latypova wrote: <span class="quote">"I had the covid illness,
it was definitely a neurotoxic poisoning, quote nasty"</span>.

She now seems to claim that her illness was caused by driving through
fog. However when I searched her Twitter and Substack for the keyword
<span class="quote">"fog"</span>, I didn't find her mentioning that she
got COVID from the fog, so I don't know if she only came up with the
story in 2025 to support the new conspiracy theory that illnesses are
caused by mystery fog.</p>
<p>In 2023 Latypova wrote that she and her husband were cured from COVID
by ivermectin.

But why would ivermectin work against poisoning by fog?</p>

<p>Jane Ruby said that her sample of mystery chemtrail fog had <span
class="quote">"crazy levels of toxic metals"</span>:

<p>However during the interview with Ruby, Latypova also said that
symptoms of COVID might be caused by cadmium or lead: <span
class="quote">"I think over time the army, by doing these experiments
and exercises - maybe originally they used these fluorescent particles
as a tracer and they didn't realize they can cause respiratory illness.
When they realized they can cause respiratory illness with this, they
realized, <span class="quote">'Hey, this is a great way to weaponize
it.'</span> So, uh, but also there's a whole category of things now that
are called biomimetics, which didn't exist at the time. So biomimetics
are chemical agents like these fluorescent - like cadmium or lead. [...]
So they're chemicals, mimicking the effects of what's believed to be
viruses, right? So they mimic respiratory illness."</span>

<p>In August 2025 when someone on Twitter said that COVID is caused by
5G, Latypova said <span class="quote">"I had covid illness in the area
that does not have 5G. Therefore, it wasn't 5G that caused covid
illness."</span>

But she said COVID might rather be caused by chemtrails instead:

<p>The mystery fog is a new conspiracy theory that seems to have emerged
in late December 2024. These were early tweets about the theory:

</div>
<p>The earliest tweet about the mystery fog by Jane Ruby I found was
from December 31st 2024 UTC:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealdrjaneruby+fog&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=from%<wbr>3Arealdrjaneruby+<wbr>fog&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The earliest BitChute video I found about the toxic mystery fog was
posted on December 30th 2024 UTC. It was uploaded by a channel called
<span class="quote">"GreatAwakening.io - Truths &amp; Secrets
Exposed"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=mystery+fog&sort=new>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>query=mystery+<wbr>fog&amp;<wbr>sort=new</a>]</p>
<p>In January 2025 Stew Peters did a video about the mystery fog, where
he said: <span class="quote">"Almost like it's not fog at all. Almost
like it's some chemical or biological agent that's being released or
sprayed and dropped down onto the masses. And just like I mentioned,
wherever this fog goes, people are getting sick. People are reporting
headaches, severe flu-like symptoms, or stomach issues."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/eSeedvvn7VnC>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>eSeedvvn7VnC</a>,
5:50] Next he interviewed a flat earther called Austin Wittsit, who
said: <span class="quote">"I think a lot of germ theory is pseudoscience
used to push different vaccines and stuff. But one thing that is real is
toxic chemicals, similar to DDT, that they spray on people and claim
it's polio and stuff. So this seems to be the actual way that they would
be able to attack people and their health - would be an actual toxic
chemical that you inhale."</span> [12:51] Sounds just like Latypova.</p>
<p>Daily Mail published an article about the mystery fog on January 3rd
2025 UTC, where they compared the fog to Operation Sea Spray:
[<a href=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14248393/mystery-fog-operation-sea-spray-chemical-bioweapon.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>dailymail.<wbr>co.<wbr>uk/<wbr>sciencetech/<wbr>article-<wbr>14248393/<wbr>mystery-<wbr>fog-<wbr>operation-<wbr>sea-<wbr>spray-<wbr>chemical-<wbr>bioweapon.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-fog-early-3.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>In 2025 Latypova also started talking about Operation Sea Spray, and
she said that similar operations of spraying chemicals or bacteria may
have explained symptoms of COVID.
[<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/weaponization-of-disease-agents-part-099>https://<wbr>sashalatypova.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>weaponization-<wbr>of-<wbr>disease-<wbr>agents-<wbr>part-<wbr>099</a>]</p>
<p>Several people made videos that connected the mystery fog to
Operation Sea Spray. Some people even claimed that the fog in Florida
contained the same species of bacteria that was used in Operation Sea
Spray:</p>
