<a href=#No_virus_lite_theories_of_Sasha_Latypova_Mike_Yeadon_and_Karen_Kingston id=No_virus_lite_theories_of_Sasha_Latypova_Mike_Yeadon_and_Karen_Kingston>No-virus-lite theories of Sasha Latypova, Mike Yeadon, and Karen Kingston</a>
</h2>
<p>Around November 2022, J.J. Couey started to say that RNA viruses cannot cause pandemics, that COVID was caused by localized releases of infectious cDNA clones, and that the laboratory origin of the virus is a distraction and that gain-of-function research is not very dangerous. And Couey also started doing streams of videos by no-virus people like Andrew Kaufman, and he started saying that the no-virus people are right in a lot of ways but that he wanted to create a more nuanced version of their theory. Around the same time in late 2022, Mike Yeadon, Sasha Latypova, and Karen Kingston all started to promote a similar story that COVID was not caused by a virus, that viruses are not capable of causing pandemics, and that gain-of-function research is not actually that dangerous. Latypova said that COVID may have been caused by a release of aerosolized nanoparticles or by some kind of a release of toxins. And Kingston said that COVID was caused by an aerosol attack of bat vaccines that only contained the spike protein but not the full virus.</p>
<p>In a Substack post in February 2023, Latypova wrote the following: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230304144011/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/deliberate-deployment-of-bio-chemical>http://web.archive.org/web/20230304144011/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/deliberate-deployment-of-bio-chemical</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lab Leak is baloney. I hope you can see it now as it is being unveiled in the most unsubtle way right on cue before WHO pandemic treaty is being put in place.</p>
<p>They are trotting this earthshattering breaking story now, finally telling you the <span class="quote">"truth"</span> (yeah, we lied a little bit about pangolins and bats, but it was for your own good, silly peasants!) because WHO treaty is happening now, and they need everyone to fall in line supporting the global totalitarian biosecurity state, where the unelected overlords will <span class="quote">"protect you"</span> from <span class="quote">"lab leaks from enemies and rogue scientists"</span>, by putting you in 15-minute prisons, I mean smart cities, and murdering you with protective military prototype <span class="quote">"vaccines"</span>.</p>
<p>If you still think lab leaks are a thing - please explain how they can happen, when nobody can produce animal to animal infection by <span class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> in the lab? But it can leak and infect the whole world outside the lab! Far from the lab and skipping areas in between! Just not inside it.</p>
<p>Please don't fall for this narrative. There are no lab leaks. There is deliberate deployment of bio-chemical warfare agents, toxins of various kinds, including nano-scale particles by which materials that are not terribly harmful can become much more so. This deployment can be done via aerosols, formulations in food, transdermal, etc. These are deployed by the military enforcement arm of the global banking cartel, and they do not hold allegiance to any people or nations.</p>

<p>In another Substack post in December 2022, Latypova wrote: [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/the-mouse-king>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/the-mouse-king</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this brilliant <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1660073740>presentation</a>, JJ Couey explains why, and what Sars Cov 2 biowarfare agent actually is - a purified viral clone that is marginally dangerous for a short period of time and does not spread by itself.</p>
<p>If you hear <span class="quote">"every PhD student can make a deadly pathogen in a home lab"</span> - please do not fall for this 3-letter agencies-inspired nonsense. While the techniques maybe available, these <span class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> are duds that cannot and do not spread as they get rapidly attenuated by interaction with all living nature. To make something remotely dangerous one needs to make and purify A LOT of biological material, which is very expensive and requires substantial manufacturing facilities. PhD students do not have these kind of resources. You know who does? The Government-Military-Academia-Pharmaceutical complex that appropriates and spends billions to <span class="quote">"keep you safe"</span> from <span class="quote">"rogue PhD students"</span>. However, the government-academia-pharma cartel cannot make anything that lives and spreads by itself. They have to apply their biowarfare materials in some other ways, such as aerosols, gels and other formulations and even then it is only dangerous to small numbers of people and for a short period of time. Here's Peter Daszak's <a href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966-defuse-proposal>DEFUSE</a> proposal to DARPA explaining how he was going to make these <span class="quote">"novel automated aerosolization systems"</span>, <span class="quote">"transdermal nanoparticles applications"</span>, and <span class="quote">"edible adhesive gels"</span> and test them on bat colonies in caves (which are probably a good model for a crowded city during the commuter hour).</p>
<p>Pandemics do not exist in nature. Epidemics, if they do occur are local and self-extinguishing, because that's how nature works. The evil psychopaths cannot really make pandemics happen. They can only scare you into believing these are possible in order to gain control over you and establish their cherished dream - a global totalitarian biosecurity state. Be Not Afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an audio interview in February 2023, Latypova said that COVID was not caused by a virus: <span class="quote">"I agree with the fact that this wasn't a virus - wasn't a respiratory virus - wasn't a pandemic. Pandemics don't exist. Nothing can spread around the world, nothing like by itself. It needs a lot of help. So what they have done is they have applied in certain areas, but in combination with propaganda, they applied some sort of toxins, they probably weren't just chemicals. You know, that would be my first guess."</span> [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/tnt-radio-discussion-with-jesse-zurawell>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/tnt-radio-discussion-with-jesse-zurawell</a>, time 51:44]</p>
<p>In a video interview in August 2022, Mike Yeadon said the following: [<a href=https://genkimanquest.substack.com/p/dr-mike-yeadon-on-respiratory-viruses>https://genkimanquest.substack.com/p/dr-mike-yeadon-on-respiratory-viruses</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/dMFGHuOuucsI/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/dMFGHuOuucsI/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be - I'll call them the perpetrators, the people running this global crime, it's a global crime to take over all of humanity - what they've done is they've pretended that there was a serious new respiratory viral health threat, this virus in Wuhan.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there never was an exaggerated - there never was any new health threat whatsoever. Partly the beauty of this is, it can't go wrong, there are no moving parts. There's literally, the only moving part is the PCR test. The initial thing, an exaggerated health threat.</p>
<p>Now, some people believe there's a new virus. But if so, it is not any more serious than influenza, not really, because flu vanished at the same time by sheer coincidence.</p>
<p>Personally, I have come to the conclusion, and I will credit Andrew Cowan [sic; he combined the names of Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan] and his colleagues, I had a really good chat with those guys early in 2020, and it bothered me, bothered me, bothered me. I realized over time I could no longer maintain my understanding of respiratory viruses as I thought I knew them.</p>
<p>And then I learned a new bit of information recently and it was just, it collapsed the possibility that respiratory viruses as described exist at all. They don't.</p>
<p>People do get ill, people are ill, and people have exactly the same illnesses - Peter, and your listeners - exactly the same illnesses as before that horrible Yeadon said viruses don't exist. They still have quote <span class="quote">"colds"</span>, they still have quote <span class="quote">"flu"</span>. I think we don't know what causes them and they're not respiratory viruses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2022, Karen Kingston wrote that Stew Peters asked her to explain what happened in Wuhan, and then because of that she issued a statement on the Stew Peters Show where she said the following: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221216072116/https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/what-happened-in-wuhan-75-billion>http://web.archive.org/web/20221216072116/https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/what-happened-in-wuhan-75-billion</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Residents of Wuhan and other cities of China, Italy and the United States, were victims of a coordinated nanoparticle bioweapon attack, a bioweapon attack using the same nanoparticles that are in all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Most victims became infected with the nanoparticles via a direct aerosol attack, surface transmission, or food and beverage contamination.</p>
<p>US citizens should be horrified to learn that EcoHealth Alliance, the NIH, the DOD, and other departments within our US government refer to lipid nanoparticles (nanocarriers) as vaccine technology that can a deliver toxin, chemical weapon, and/or weapon of biowarfare.</p>
<p>The EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA clearly identifies nanoparticle bioweapons as spike proteins, spike protein nanoparticles that are <span class="quote">"bat vaccines."</span> EcoHealth lays out the plan to"'vaccinate" residents of select Chinese cities as well as US residents with spike-protein nanoparticle bat-vaccines via aerosol attack, surface transmission, and food and beverage contamination. The purposes of the nanoparticle bat-vaccines are to suppress the human immune system while turning human beings into carriers of lethal diseases.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>COVID-19 is caused by an advanced nanoparticle bioweapon that uses mRNA technology to strategically deteriorate and destroy cardiovascular, neurological, immune and reproductive systems. COVID-19 is NOT caused by a virus, gain-of-function or wild-type.</p>
<p>Lastly, the victims who were originally inoculated with the bioweapon in 2020 were not highly-contagious, if infectious at all. The first round of nanoparticle bioweapons did not contain mRNA codes. They were <span class="quote">"empty rounds."</span> There were also over 200 mRNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020. The virus was never isolated because multiple mRNA sequences were released.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>It's important to understand that <span class="quote">"gain-of function viruses"</span> are simply mRNA codes. mRNA is not a biosynthetic substance itself, mRNA is a software code. SARS-CoV-2 is not a virus, it's a software code programmed into nanoparticles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how in the article above Kingston even wrote that SARS-CoV-2 is not a virus. Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"The bioweapons developed by EcoHealth, US and CCP are far worse than <span class="quote">'GOF viruses'</span>. Military nanoparticle bioweapons <span class="quote">'spike proteins'</span> were intentionally released on global citizens (not a virus).Every human being has the right to know this info."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1606065203367407616>https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1606065203367407616</a>] Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Why did the CIA put out the Chinese lab leak as a cover story for COVID-19? Because COVID-19 is not caused by a mRNA gain-of-function SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 is caused by the lipid nanoparticle technology, an Ai bioweapon."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1613576186596294656>https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1613576186596294656</a>]</p>
<p>Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, Jane Ruby, and Stew Peters all use the word <span class="quote">"bioweapon"</span> to refer to COVID vaccines. When I searched for old tweets by Stew Peters which contained the word virus, it seemed like in the first half of 2021 he was speaking of the virus as if it actually exists, but in the second half of 2021 he started putting scare quotes around the word virus, and in August 2021 he linked to an article about Christine Massey's FOIA requests where he wrote: <span class="quote">"The whole COVID <span class="quote">'Virus'</span> thing just crumbled. Completely."</span> And then in December 2021 after he interviewed Karen Kingston, Stew Peters posted a large number of tweets like this where he promoted Karen Kingston's theory: [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1604153555656622081>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1604153555656622081</a>]</p>

<p>Fans of our Pfizer crew seem to be convinced that the lab leak narrative is a distraction and that COVID was caused by a nanoparticle attack:</p>

<p>Added later: Before Latypova appeared on Stew Peters in January 2022, she was already saying that the virus hasn't been isolated on Telegram: [<a href=https://t.me/COVID1984chat/252193>https://t.me/COVID1984chat/252193</a>]</p>
<div>

<p>During a Twitter space in 2024, Latypova said that she and her husband got sick at the same time and she lost her sense of smell and taste, but she didn't need to take a COVID test because she knew it was fake: <span class="quote">"Myself and my husband got simultaneously sick. I never took any COVID test - cause, I just, you know, I knew it was fake - but the symptomology was very very characteristic, the loss of taste and smell."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/SeanBFlanagan/status/1797332010446311485>https://x.com/SeanBFlanagan/status/1797332010446311485</a>, time 53:55]</p>

<p>Latypova was a co-founder of iCardiac Technologies which did a multimillion-dollar deal with Pfizer in 2007: [<a href=https://rbj.net/2007/01/29/icardiac-technologies-signs-deal-with-pfizer/>https://rbj.net/2007/01/29/icardiac-technologies-signs-deal-with-pfizer/</a>]</p>

<p>Medical technology firm iCardiac Technologies Inc. has inked a multiyear, multimillion-dollar deal with Pfizer Inc., which includes an undisclosed equity investment in the local firm.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><span class="quote">"We are extremely pleased that Pfizer has partnered with iCardiac in further developing iCardiac's suite of ECG-based biomarkers and its COMPAS platform technology for advancing the field of cardiac safety testing in pharmaceutical research and development,"</span> said Alexandra Latypova, co-founder and executive vice president of iCardiac Technologies, in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before iCardiac, Latypova worked at a company called VirtualScopics whose lead customer used to be Pfizer: [<a href=http://www.innovocracy.org/AboutUs/BoardofDirectors.aspx>http://www.innovocracy.org/AboutUs/BoardofDirectors.aspx</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to iCardiac Technologies, Ms. Latypova headed sales and business development at VirtualScopics, Inc., a technology spin out from the University of Rochester, which achieved peak market capitalization of over $200 million (NASDAQ: VSCP). During her tenure at VirtualScopics, she expanded the client portfolio from one lead customer, Pfizer, to 6 of the top-10 pharmaceutical companies as well as multiple smaller pharmaceutical and medical device clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Latypova's husband Mikael Totterman also worked for both iCardiac and VirtualScopics. In his LinkedIn profile, he included the following entries on a list of his past employers: [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/totterman/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/totterman/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>iCardiac Technologies (founder of venture capital and Pfizer-backed company, transacted to Norwest Venture Partners in a control transaction and subsequently sold to ERT for $230 million at 20x return to early investors). Now part of Cleria Research.</li>
<li>VirtualScopics (business leader of venture capital, Pfizer, and GE Healthcare backed startup, peak market cap on NASDAQ of $200 million). Now part of Philips Healthcare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Karen Kingston has said that she used to be a <span class="quote">"top-performing cardiovascular specialty representative with Pfizer"</span> and that afterwards Pfizer was one of the clients of her consulting firm called Varitage. [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-perception-reality>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-perception-reality</a>] Her LinkedIn says that from 1996 to 1998, she was a <span class="quote">"Labs/Cardiovascular Healthcare Representative"</span> at Pfizer where she <span class="quote">"took Manhattan territory from near last in the North East Region to #1"</span> and she was <span class="quote">"promoted to Cardiovascular Healthcare Representative for the east side of Manhattan"</span>, and that from 1998 to 2000 she worked as an account supervisor for CDM New York in Manhattan, which was <span class="quote">"integral in the relaunch of Viagra by shifting focus of the campaign to younger men and establishing the clinical relevance of sexual health to overall wellness"</span>. [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenkingstonkk/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenkingstonkk/</a>] Her LinkedIn profile also says that she has been the president and founder of Varitage from 2007 until present, with the following description: <span class="quote">"Services range from strategic business planning and clinical communications to the development of broad-reaching digital marketing plans and e-commerce platforms. Clients include industry leaders, such as Pfizer and Medtronic, to start-ups and leading venture capital firms, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corporation."</span></p>

<p>On a subreddit of the United States Army, there was a question about what work in psyops really involves, where someone answered that they were specialized in psychological operations and that it was <span class="quote">"very similar to public relations and marketing with different audiences"</span>. [<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rwyrfb/what_is_psyops_really/>https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rwyrfb/what_is_psyops_really/</a>] And another user also answered: <span class="quote">"Did Psyop for 6years now do Marketing. It's very similar just different target audience and you're not selling Tide detergent."</span> Karen Kingston seems to have followed the opposite career trajectory.</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon is sometimes erroneously described as the former vice president of Pfizer, but he was only the vice president and chief scientific officer of Pfizer's division for allergy and respiratory research. An article from 2012 said: <span class="quote">"Ziarco's CEO Dr Mike Yeadon was chief scientific officer, allergy and respiratory research, during his time at Pfizer, before the US pharma firm announced last year it would leave the facility."</span> [<a href=https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/pfizer_helps_fund_biotech_venture_from_former_researchers_at_closed_kent_facility_446225>https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/pfizer_helps_fund_biotech_venture_from_former_researchers_at_closed_kent_facility_446225</a>] In an interview of Yeadon in 2013, he was described as the former <span class="quote">"head of allergy and respiratory biology"</span> of Pfizer. [<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3936>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3936</a>] An article by Yeadon from 2020 said: <span class="quote">"Dr Mike Yeadon is the former CSO and VP, Allergy and Respiratory Research Head with Pfizer Global R&amp;D and co-Founder of Ziarco Pharma Ltd."</span> [<a href=https://dailysceptic.org/2020/09/20/lies-damned-lies-and-health-statistics-the-deadly-danger-of-false-positives/>https://dailysceptic.org/2020/09/20/lies-damned-lies-and-health-statistics-the-deadly-danger-of-false-positives/</a>]</p>
<p>An article about Mike Yeadon's company Ziarco said: [<a href=https://drug-dev.com/ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-secures-financing/>https://drug-dev.com/ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-secures-financing/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ziarco recently announced the closing of an initial $6-million tranche of Series A financing totalling $27 million. The round was led by Biotechnology Value Fund L.P, with participation by Pfizer Venture Investments.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the financing, Ziarco has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize a portfolio of clinical, preclinical, and research anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic assets. In return, Pfizer will receive equity as well as certain product-based milestone and royalty payments. Ziarco will use the proceeds of the financing to continue development of these assets and advance proprietary research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the stories that Latypova has covered are also somehow related to Pfizer, as you can see from these descriptions of her BitChute videos:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-descriptions.png width=1100>
</div>
<p>It would make sense for Pfizer to insert a bunch of people in alt media to first say that Pfizer vaccines contain hydras, and next that Pfizer vaccines contain snake venom, and then that Pfizer vaccines contain self-assembling robot arms. It makes anti-vaxxers look ridiculous, and it causes genuine criticism of the vaccines to get buried within a sea of false information.</p>

</h2>
<p>I believe Latypova did her alt media debut on January 7th 2022 UTC on the Stew Peters Show, or at least I didn't find tweets about any earlier appearances she did in alt media: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-3-1+%28sasha+OR+alexandra%29+latypova&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-3-1+%28sasha+OR+alexandra%29+latypova&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>The Rumble video for Stew's interview with Latypova was titled <span class="quote">"LIVE: Hackers Reveal DEADLY Jab Lot Numbers, HORRIFIC Pfizer Teen Trial Data and MORE!"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data%2d.html>https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data%2d.html</a>] The description of the video said: <span class="quote">"Recently on this show Dr. Jane Ruby came on and gave us the remarkable information that a huge percentage of side effects tracked in the CDC's VAERS database are linked to just a small percentage of the vaccine batches produced by Pfizer and Moderna. This data came from a group calling itself Team Enigma. They're a group of independent researchers with experience in medical R&amp;D, statistics, data analytics, and everything else you'd need to investigate a vaccine's impact on millions of people. A lot of Team Enigma is anonymous but thankfully one of their number has agreed to speak publicly. Sasha Latypova joins us to discuss."</span></p>
<p>During the interview with Latypova, Stew Peters said that the vaccine data discussed by Team Enigma was released by a team of hackers, but actually the data was publicly available from VAERS. [<a href=https://www.techarp.com/internet/pfizer-moderna-vaccine-data-hack/>https://www.techarp.com/internet/pfizer-moderna-vaccine-data-hack/</a>] I don't think it was just a mistake by Stew to say that the data was released by hackers, because before Latypova had appeared on Stew's show, a news site called <span class="quote">"Before It's News"</span> also published an article dated January 6th 2022 which said: <span class="quote">"Hackers broke into all the pharmaceutical companies and stold all the medial data on vaccines thank God!!!! The Great Awaking has lifted off!!! Forward this link everywhere!!!!"</span> [<a href=https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2022/01/hackers-crack-pfizer-moderna-pfizer-servers-all-vaccine-death-data-now-public-from-all-companies-thanks-to-hackers-3043939.html>https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2022/01/hackers-crack-pfizer-moderna-pfizer-servers-all-vaccine-death-data-now-public-from-all-companies-thanks-to-hackers-3043939.html</a>] (It's interesting that Team Enigma's story was being promoted by the <span class="quote">"Great Awakening"</span> types before video presentations about the data by Latypova and Yeadon had even been released.)</p>
<p>On January 8th 2022 UTC which was a day later than Latypova appeared on Stew Peters, the Odysee channel of Füllmich's Corona Investigative Committee published a video where Mike Yeadon did a presentation of Team Enigma's vaccine lot variability data. One of his slides said that the slides were prepared by Team Enigma and the filename of the slides was <span class="quote">"VAERS by LOT-Dec13-video ver Latypova -1.pptx"</span>: [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en>https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yeadon-fullmich-committee.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Latypova said on Twitter: <span class="quote">"I gave Mike Yeadon these slides when he was going on Reiner Fullmich's Corona Committee, bc he asked me. During the video he said <span class="quote">'my colleague'</span> and <span class="quote">'she'</span> - that's referring to me. At the time I was practically unknown."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1877585275326705931>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1877585275326705931</a>]</p>
<p>A transcript of Yeadon's presentation was published by UK Column. [<a href=https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies>https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies</a>] In June 2022, Latypova and Yeadon were both speakers in a symposium by Doctors for COVID Ethics which was hosted by UK Column. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-iv-freedom-is-the-cure/>https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-iv-freedom-is-the-cure/</a>] Latypova only started her Substack in December 2022, but before that she wrote a long article about Pfizer's safety testing which was first published by Doctors for COVID Ethics, and Doctors for COVID Ethics also published a long article by Yeadon in 2022: [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.pdf</a>, <a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Covid-Lies-updated.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Covid-Lies-updated.pdf</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-yeadon-pdf.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Doctors for COVID Ethics also published a Spanish translation of Latypova's article. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.es%5f.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.es%5f.pdf</a>] Doctors for COVID Ethics is an organization of Sucharit Bhakdi. Bhakdi and Füllmich are both based in Germany but they have previously lived in the U.S.</p>

<a href=#International_connections_and_Miles_Guos_bots id=International_connections_and_Miles_Guos_bots>International connections and Miles Guo's bots</a>
</h2>
<p>After Latypova's appeared on the Stew Peters Show in January 2022, her second-oldest interview I found was done by a Dutch channel called <span class="quote">"Medisch weekjournaal"</span> and her third-oldest interview I found was done by J.J. Couey who used to work at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam (which George Webb says is home to one of NATO's main bioweapon labs). And it might be a coincidence, but the main guy in Team Enigma was Craig Paardekooper, who lives in the UK but who is of Dutch ancestry.</p>
<p>Content by people who appear on the Stew Peters Network is often translated to several non-English languages, just like QAnon content and content by Miles Guo's network. The story about graphene oxide originally came from a Spanish group called La Quinta Columna, but they also have an Odysee channel where they post content from the Stew Peters Network with subtitles in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish: [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational?view=content>https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational?view=content</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-quinta-odysee.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's Twitter bots also post video clips from English-language alt media with subtitles in various languages, and often even bots that primarily post in Chinese randomly post videos with subtitles in European languages. Often the same bots also post tweets in several different languages, like how the account shown below posted tweets in Chinese, German, French, and Spanish. For example the bot below posted a clip of an interview of Latypova with Chinese subtitles, but the bot has also tweeted in languages like German, Spanish, and French: [<a href=https://x.com/369Jessica369/status/1579301325996969985>https://x.com/369Jessica369/status/1579301325996969985</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guobot.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>(Or actually I don't know if some of the accounts are hybrids between manually-ran accounts and bots, or they might be bots which pick some of their tweets from a pool of human-written templates, or they might be manually-ran accounts which post some automated tweets, but I'll refer to them as bots for the sake of convenience.)</p>
<p>One of the Guo bots also promoted J.J. Couey's story that people who say that the virus is a bioweapon are trying to trick you into being afraid of the virus. The same bot posted photos from the first anniversary of the New Federal State of China, which was held at the One World Trade Center in New York City, and which featured Limeng Yan as one of the speakers along with the former DIA head Mike Flynn and the naval intelligence officers Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-jc-guobot.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's bots often have English names, like how the bots in the screenshots above are named 369Jessica369 and Judy Anderson.</p>
<p>The funeral director John O'Looney was also promoted by Miles Guo's bots: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-1-1+john+o%27looney+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-1-1+john+o%27looney+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-looneybot.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The account below posted a clip of a video by Latypova, but the same account has tweeted in languages like French and Italian, and it has tweeted about <span class="quote">"Q drops"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-guobot.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor are the Three Microscope Stooges whose specialty is using an optical microscope to find nanotechnology in COVID vaccines or human blood. All three of them have been promoted by Sasha Latypova and all three of them have appeared on the Stew Peters Show. The Twitter account in the screenshot below posted a link to an interview of Shimon Yanowitz by Stew Peters, but the same account has also posted links to news stories in random European languages. The profile picture of the Twitter account is an emblem of the Australian branch of Miles Guo's Himalaya Supervisory Organization:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yanowitz-bot.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>It's interesting that Himalaya Supervisory Organization has branches on several different continents, just like how Children's Health Defense has a European chapter, an Australian chapter, and an African chapter. Miles Guo's bots seem to promote content both by people associated with CHD and people associated with the Stew Peters Network. Latypova was also a speaker in an event in Sweden that was jointly organized by a Swedish organization and the European chapter of CHD. [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/quick-faq-about-upcoming-events-in>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/quick-faq-about-upcoming-events-in</a>]</p>
<p>Miles Guo's network has a bunch of translators who translate their content to foreign languages. The CHD has a blog called <span class="quote">"The Defender"</span> which is translated to German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. [<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defensor/?lang=es>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defensor/?lang=es</a>] La Quinta Columna's Odysee channel posts videos with subtitles in the same set of languages, except they sometimes also post videos with Russian or Romanian subtitles.</p>
<p>Miles Guo's movement seems like another iteration of the formula that Western intelligence agencies employed to create the Unification Church and Falun Gong, because all three of them had an East Asian figurehead based in New York, all three of them controlled media empires which promoted Christianity and conspiracy content, and all three of them also publish media in various Western languages in addition to East Asian languages. Many of the East Asian people associated with Guo are Christians, like how Dinggang Wang is called Luther because he is a Lutheran (and Limeng Yan is also a Lutheran according to one source but I haven't verified it). The Unification Church also had an arm called CAUSA which operated several newspapers, publishing houses, and radio stations in Latin America. Falun Gong runs an English-language conspiracy video channel called Edge of Wonder TV, which has promoted a lot of junk conspiracies like ancient aliens and QAnon. In February 2020, Guo's news site GNews published an article which said that there was a high concentration of sulphur dioxide over Wuhan which indicated that a massive number of bodies were being burned in Wuhan, but as one of their sources, they cited the website of a Chinese-language radio station called <span class="quote">"Sound of Hope"</span> which is based in the United States and which is ran by Falun Gong. [<a href=https://gnews.org/m/16240>https://gnews.org/m/16240</a>] (Actually earlier on January 5th, some guy on Twitter had already spotted the high sulphur dioxide level over Wuhan, but he said that it came from an aluminum plant which burned petroleum coke to make anodes. [<a href=https://x.com/psravenscroft1/status/1213935504057454592>https://x.com/psravenscroft1/status/1213935504057454592</a>])</p>
<p>The accounts that promote Miles Guo are also promoting Mike Yeadon and Karen Kingston: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=yeadon+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=yeadon+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/search?q=karen+kingston+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=karen+kingston+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-yeadon.jpg width=400><img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-kingston.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>(The screenshots above show that the Guo accounts post a lot of links to Gettr, but it's probably because Guo's foundation is one of the owners of Gettr, so many of the Guo accounts even use the logo of Gettr as their profile picture. Most of the Guo accounts are probably bots, but Guo's movement also includes members who are known as <span class="quote">"ants"</span> who promote his content in a manner that is sometimes difficult to distinguish from bots.)</p>
<p>The tweet below included a clip of a video where Bret Weinstein talked about DRASTIC which was translated to Chinese with a watermark of the Himalaya Supervisory Organization: [<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-drastic.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's movement has several Discord groups where I believe people who work as Guo's translators post clips of videos from English-language alt media with Chinese subtitles, so the people in the Discord groups might choose themselves which videos they end up translating. So even if Guo's movement would be ran by western intelligence, it doesn't necessarily mean that all of the people whose videos they translate would also be controlled opposition.</p>
<p>In December 2022 Michael P. Senger was one of the first people who started promoting JC's new Scooby Doo theory, because he wrote a long Substack post about one of JC's streams titled <span class="quote">"DRASTIC Founder Renounces Lab Leak Theory of COVID's Origins"</span>. But Senger is also the author of an anti-China book titled <span class="quote">"Snake Oil: How Xi Jinping Shut Down the World"</span>: [<a href=https://www.michaelpsenger.com/p/drastic-founder-renounces-lab-leak>https://www.michaelpsenger.com/p/drastic-founder-renounces-lab-leak</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-senger.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Michael P. Senger's bio says that <span class="quote">"his work can be found in Tablet Magazine, on Twitter under the handle <span class="citation" data-cites="michaelpsenger">@michaelpsenger</span>, and on Substack at michaelpsenger.substack.com"</span>. [<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Jinping-Shut-World/dp/1957083786>https://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Jinping-Shut-World/dp/1957083786</a>] Wikipedia says that Tablet Magazine is <span class="quote">"a conservative online magazine focused on Jewish news and culture"</span>.</p>
<p>In October 2023 when Israel was totally taken by surprise by Hamas which they did not create and fund themselves, Michael P. Senger tweeted a link to an article by Voice of America, where he quoted text that said: <span class="quote">"Antisemitic remarks have flooded China's heavily censored online platforms…since the Hamas attacks on Israel… Scores of online Chinese commentators and netizens quickly rallied for Gaza after the Hamas attacks…saying Israel deserves the bloodshed."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714443184519176638>https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714443184519176638</a>] Senger also tweeted a link to an article that was published by an English-language newspaper based in Taiwan, where he quoted the text <span class="quote">"China's state media accused of spreading anti-Israel disinformation… Chinese state-run media has spread the unverified rumor that Israeli forces are using white phosphorus bombs against civilians in a manner that contravenes international law."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714446208696209834>https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714446208696209834</a>] And he tweeted a link to an article by Wall Street Journal which said that China <span class="quote">"has embraced the Palestinian cause in a way it hadn't done in decades. Its once cordial ties with Israel are in tatters."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714063843918299176>https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714063843918299176</a>] Limeng Yan has also posted a large number of similar tweets where she says that CCP is supporting Palestine. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Adrlimengyan1%20hamas>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Adrlimengyan1%20hamas</a>]</p>
<p>Karen Kingston also blames everything on the <span class="quote">"CCP"</span>. Kingston wrote: <span class="quote">"My prayers and intentions were that those who received my emails in May of 2021 would verify the information I sent and immediately share the message that the COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE BIOWEAPONS using an advanced lipid nanoparticle technology made in China.

A nanoweapon technology that's owned by the Chinese military and used in the COVID-19 vaccines."</span> [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/part-5-dismantling-the-covid-19-deceptions>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/part-5-dismantling-the-covid-19-deceptions</a>] Kingston also published a Substack post with the title <span class="quote">"BREAKING: Tesla Corporation Could Currently Be Under the Control of the Chinese Military"</span>. [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/breaking-tesla-corporation-could>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/breaking-tesla-corporation-could</a>]</p>
<p>Karen Kingston reminds me of Cyrus Parsa, because both of them pretend to be experts on AI and 5G and they blame everything on China. Cyrus Parsa has a master's degree in homeland security. Celeste Solum also says that she used to work for FEMA and DHS, but she's another one of these people who claim to be former insiders in the system, and who are interviewed by people like Stew Peters and Mike Adams, and who talk about topics like AI, nanotechnology, quantum dots, and hydrogel. I think Cyrus Parsa first entered into alt media through Owen Shroyer's show, which should be a huge red flag. The oldest tweet I found which mentioned Parsa was made in October 2019 by an account called <span class="quote">"Informal Warfare"</span> whose profile picture is a drawing of Alex Jones, and the second oldest tweet I found was a link to an interview that Parsa did with Owen Shroyer the same day. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&amp;f=live</a>] In December 2019, Parsa filed a lawsuit against <span class="quote">"Google L.L.C, Facebook inc, DeepMind Inc, Alphabet Inc, Neuralink Inc, Tesla Inc, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, CISON PR NewsWire &amp; John Doe's 1-29"</span> for reasons such as <span class="quote">"MISUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, CYBERNETICS, ROBOTICS, BIOMETRICS, BIOENGINEERING, 5G AND QUANTUM COMPUTING TECNNOLOGY, and for transfering AI technology to China, and for violation of several genocide conventions because of China's treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Christians, and Falun Gong"</span>. [<a href=https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&context=historical>https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&amp;context=historical</a>] One of the oldest tweets I found which mentioned Parsa was posted by an account named <span class="quote">"Uyghurtrailblazer"</span> which tweeted: <span class="quote">"A historic day for the Uyghurs and other victims of China. Mr. Cyrus Parsa filed a suit against Google, FB and a few others in California. Spread the news. I am calling on the Uyghurs and other freedom lovers to back Mr. Parsa!!!"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Trailbl16797622/status/1208942910454013953>https://x.com/Trailbl16797622/status/1208942910454013953</a>] (For some reason there seems to be a huge number of these Uyghur separatist accounts on Twitter who post in English.)</p>
<p>The same kind of people who are employed to produce disinformation that is targeted against foreign adversaries are also employed to produce disinformation that is targeted against the domestic population. For example Dr. Eowyn had one of the most popular blogs about Sandy Hook and she wrote three chapters in Jim Fetzer's book about Sandy Hook. In 2016 it was revealed that her real name was Maria Hsia Chang, and that she was a practicioner of Falun Gong and she wrote a book about Falun Gong where she presented them in a favorable light, and that she had written several academic articles which basically promoted the line of Epoch Times on East Asian policy. [<a href=https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/>https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/</a>] Her old bio on the website of her university said that she <span class="quote">"is a lecturer for the U. S. Department of Defense's Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, as well as the U. S. Marine Corps War College"</span>. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm</a>] Dr. Eowyn also collaborated with David Weiss, who used to be an assistant of the Sandy Hook hoaxer Wolfgang Halbig. David Weiss later became a flat earther, and in March 2020 he was one of the very first big names in alt media who started to say that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not exist. [<a href=novirus.html#David-Weiss-and-Timothy-Rothschild>novirus.html#David-Weiss-and-Timothy-Rothschild</a>] One video that David Weiss did with Stew Peters was titled <span class="quote">"TRUTH About Flat Earth Theory: Biblical Firmament vs. Round Ball Earth Propaganda"</span>, and the description of the video said: <span class="quote">"This week on Stew Peters premium, we are joined by Dave Weiss to discuss NASA and Big Tech's lies surrounding the shape of the earth we all live on."</span> [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/truth-about-flat-earth-theory-biblical-firmament-vs-round-ball-earth-propaganda/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/truth-about-flat-earth-theory-biblical-firmament-vs-round-ball-earth-propaganda/</a>] In one episode of the Stew Peters Show, the first guest was Emily Grace Rainey who they described as a <span class="quote">"former Special Operations psyop officer"</span>, and the second guest was David Weiss who presented his sales pitch about flat earth. [<a href=https://www.stewpeters.com/video/2022/12/power-blackouts-sweep-nation-former-special-operations-psyop-officer-warns-of-incoming-war/>https://www.stewpeters.com/video/2022/12/power-blackouts-sweep-nation-former-special-operations-psyop-officer-warns-of-incoming-war/</a>] I don't know how long Stew Peters has been a flat earther, but by 2023 he was saying on Twitter that the earth is flat. [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1686187946141999105>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1686187946141999105</a>, <a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1695953001599349218>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1695953001599349218</a>, <a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1642979962318643204>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1642979962318643204</a>]</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon recommended people to listen to interviews of the flat earther Sage of Quay: <span class="quote">"If you don't yet have that understanding, that a small group of powerful families have organised the way the world works with increasing precision down the centuries, it will be harder to see the otherwise <span class="quote">'hidden hand'</span>. I recommend listening to recent interviews given by Mike Williams aka Sage of Quay."</span> [<a href=https://suavek1.substack.com/p/the-arguments-for-no-virus-part-8>https://suavek1.substack.com/p/the-arguments-for-no-virus-part-8</a>] Sage of Quay was one of the many flat earthers who were early promoters of the no-virus theory. His blog has now been deleted and his posts weren't archived at the Wayback Machine, but he seems to have posted videos about the no-virus theory Owen Benjamin and David Icke in early April 2020, and he may have already written about the theory in March 2020.

</h2>
<p>In October 2022, Latypova posted an interview she did with David Nixon on BitChute. The description of the video said: <span class="quote">"I recently spoke with Dr. David Nixon who was able to conduct several experiments with Pfizer injectable substance under standard optical microscope. David found that when the sample is shielded from electromagnetic field by the Faraday bag no assembly happens in it. When the slide is left overnight near a wifi router, square shaped structures appear, and then continue to grow for a long period of time."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/amzAJHl5TVfZ/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/amzAJHl5TVfZ/</a>]</p>
<p>The interview David Nixon did with Latypova is the oldest interview listed on his website: [<a href=https://drdavidnixon.com>https://drdavidnixon.com</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-david-nixon.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>However I found two people who had interviewed Nixon before Latypova, who were Maria Zeee and Ana Maria Mihalcea. [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational/M%C3%A1s-hallazgos-de-nano-y-microtecnolog%C3%ADa-dentro-de-las-vacunas-COVID-19%2e>https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational/M%C3%A1s-hallazgos-de-nano-y-microtecnolog%C3%ADa-dentro-de-las-vacunas-COVID-19%2e</a>, <a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>] Nixon's interview with Maria Zeee was translated by La Quinta Columna to French, Spanish, and Portuguese, and the translated versions were mirrored by several channels on Rumble, BitChute, and Odysee.</p>
<p>Latypova posted several tweets like this where she promoted David Nixon's microscope images: [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706455087512740183>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706455087512740183</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-smartbubbles.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In October 2022, Latypova even wrote an article about David Nixon's microscope imagery for trialsitenews.com, where she didn't have anything critical to say about Nixon's images, but she just wrote that the rectangular structures that were shown in the videos were not cholesterol or salt crystals: [<a href=https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119>https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-trialsite.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>In the second interview that Nixon did with Maria Zeee, they broke the news that COVID jabs contain self-assembling robot arms. [<a href=https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/>https://zeeemedia.com/interview/world-first-robotic-arms-assembling-via-nanotech-inside-covid-19-vaccines-filmed-in-real-time-dr-nixon/</a>] Maria Zeee's show is one of the shows on the Stew Peters Network, which always seems to be the first to break the news when strange objects are found in vaccines or in the blood of vaccinated people. At time 8:52, Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"I want to ask you, Dr. Nixon, because it looks like little robot arms, even."</span> Then Nixon circled the part of the video below where I added the red circle, and he said: <span class="quote">"This is - this - you look at the way the levers are working in this - but, you know that - you've got triangles, you've got levers, you've got pinchers. […] It even falls up on itself, goes up to get the leverage. […] It creates some sort of a propulsion system, I mean, you look at the rotation on <em>that</em>."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-robot-arm.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Nixon has said that his photos were taken with a regular light microscope at 400-fold or 2000-fold magnification level, so his photos cannot display nano-scale structures. However Ana Maria Mihalcea wrote that the photo by Nixon below featured a <span class="quote">"carbon nanotube"</span>: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-nanotube.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>For comparison, here's a real photo of carbon nanotubes that was taken with a scanning electron microscope: [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scanning-electron-microscopy-image-of-carbon-nanotube-oxide-composite-formed-by-the_fig3_224814041>https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scanning-electron-microscopy-image-of-carbon-nanotube-oxide-composite-formed-by-the_fig3_224814041</a>]]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-nanotube-2.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Nixon's videos actually even display the real contents of vaccine vials, but if they do, then the crystallized structures may be cholesterol, because cholesterol is listed as an ingredient of the Pfizer vaccines: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20210527170119/https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download>http://web.archive.org/web/20210527170119/https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-cholesterol.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In September 2022, Latypova published a video on BitChute where she interviewed the Israeli electric engineer Shimon Yanowitz, who showed photos of his blood under a light microscope. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/</a>] The description of the video said that <span class="quote">"the images show disturbing changes which are typical of the blood after Covid-19 injections, yet Shimon did not have the shots"</span>. Yanowitz said that the objects in his blood may have come from either shedding or chemtrails. At time 9:48, he said that the <span class="quote">"ribbon"</span> in the photo below might be Morgellons, and that it looked <span class="quote">"very mean"</span> and that it made red blood cells nervous: <span class="quote">"How did this ribbon - we can maybe elaborate a lot, we can discuss if this is something called Morgellons or another thing - but this seems to be composed of the same material - maybe carbon-based - that we see in the jabbed people. And this is very worrying, because I shouldn't be having it. We can see it's not natural. It's definitely not organic. And it looks very mean. And it's not the end of the story. And, so, you can also see that the red blood cells are getting very nervous around this entity."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-yanowitz.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 13:55 in the interview with Latypova, Yanowitz said: <span class="quote">"And this is just a tiny drop from my finger, and we can see all these dinosaurs emerging from this tiny blood drop."</span> (So maybe we can add dinosaurs to the list of objects that the Stew crew has found in blood or vaccines… Even though actually Yanowitz just used the word dinosaur as a descriptive term for a type of object that was visible in the photos, but I bet a certain percentage of his audience thinks that it's real dinosaurs.)</p>
<p>Latypova seemed to accept Yanowitz's claims at face value and she didn't ask him any tough questions, just like was the case with her interview with David Nixon. So is it a coincidence that Latypova did her alt media debut on the Stew Peters Show and she's promoting all of these Stew Peters psyops?</p>
<p>canceledmouse posted this comment about Latypova's interview with Yanowitz: [<a href=https://x.com/canceledmouse/status/1680751292803686401>https://x.com/canceledmouse/status/1680751292803686401</a>]</p>

<p>When I searched BitChute for the keyword Shimon Yanowitz, the oldest video I found was an interview Yanowitz did with the Jew Tom Cowan. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=shimon%20yanowitz>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=shimon%20yanowitz</a>]</p>
<p>I believe Karen Kingston made her alt media debut in July 2021 when she appeared first on the TV show of Doug Billings and next on the Stew Peters Show. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22karen+kingston%22+until%3A2021-7-29&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22karen+kingston%22+until%3A2021-7-29&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://www.bek.news/therightside/fe0c4a3a-d139-472b-ad84-da00938fd881/>https://www.bek.news/therightside/fe0c4a3a-d139-472b-ad84-da00938fd881/</a>] The show of Doug Billings is aired on BEK TV, which is a cable TV channel where they also air the Stew Peters Show, and Stew Peters is mentioned in about a quarter of the TV channel's most recent Facebook posts. [<a href=https://www.facebook.com/bektvnews>https://www.facebook.com/bektvnews</a>] When Karen Kingston first appeared on the shows of Doug Billings and Stew Peters, she was presented as a former Pfizer employee whose big revelation was that COVID vaccines contain graphene oxide and hydrogel: [<a href=https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/>https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stew Peters brings us another blockbuster interview with Karen Kingston, a former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She comes forward with indisputable documentation that must be shared with the ENTIRE WORLD, immediately.</p>
<p>She says, <span class="quote">"I read the patent to look for graphene oxide. It is not listed in the patent because it is a trade secret. Remember, Bill Gates saying that there was a trade secret?"</span> However, the Chinese patent does list graphene oxide. She says the main reason it's not listed in the US patent is because graphene oxide is poisonous and it's well-known that it's poisonous. The other reason is because it's the main ingredient of Hydrogel, which is the liquid AI template that's used for some of Elon Musk's research and Bill Gates, as far as creating an interface between humans and the internet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a certain set of nanotech-related technologies that have been hyped up in the controlled alternative media, like hydrogel, quantum dots, and graphene oxide. People on the Stew Peters Network have found all of them in COVID jabs. In 2020 the first person I heard talking about hydrogel and quantum dots was the Messianic Jew Celeste Solum, but she has later also appeared on the Stew Peters Show:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-celeste.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>Latypova has now also jumped on the hydrogel bandwagon, because in July 2023 when Jane Ruby hosted the fourth hour of InfoWars and she had Latypova on as a guest, Latypova said the following: <span class="quote">"I have some anecdotal evidence from the various sources that are reliable - that they don't have an incentive to lie about this. And I personally recorded the video with a researcher in Australia. We were looking at a common brand of dental anesthetic under microscope, just simply looking as it dries, just a drop of it drying under microscope. And we observed a bizarre chemical process - or you know, the physical chemical process - that is not consistent with just being kind of a suspension in water solution of lidocaine. It was clearly hydrogel. And hydrogels are used in injection in various materials - various medical materials - but they should be disclosed. This wasn't disclosed anywhere. And hydrogels are used to increase the stability of a fragile component, or increase the circulation time in the body, or stability. And so maybe that's why they formulated it this way, but they don't disclose it."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/</a>, time 35:55] Near the end of the interview Jane Ruby asked if there's also hydrogel in the white long kalamari clots that have supposedly been found by embalmers and funeral directors like Richard Hirschman, but Latypova answered that hydrogel is probably incorporated into the kalamari clots. [time 40:45]</p>
<p>Karen Kingston has also written: <span class="quote">"Smart hydrogel is the key nanobiotechnology that creates the deadly clots featured in Died Suddenly."</span> [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech</a>]</p>
<p>In September 2023 Latypova tweeted a photo of a glass vial with the text: <span class="quote">"Pfizer injections are hydrogel. Visible right here."</span> Someone posted this reply: <span class="quote">"Odd that with over 100 vials analyzed, I've never seen anything like what you are represented here. What is this? Where did it come from and what did you add?"</span> But Latypova replied: <span class="quote">"This is a photo from Pfizer manufacturing line in US. Manual inspection of vax vials. I have talked to many scientists and doctors and there are hours of video footage of the vials (ex-US) and they confirm the substance prior to dilution is hydrogel. It is likely DARPA hydrogel."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706423055768260824>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706423055768260824</a>] The photo she posted is supposed to have come from the Project Veritas whistleblower Melissa McAtee. [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1662955987202973698>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1662955987202973698</a>] In another tweet Latypova stated it as a fact that COVID vaccines were formulated in <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span> (and not even plain old hydrogel): [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1686782269997113344>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1686782269997113344</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>Karen Kingston published a Substack post where she said that the kalamari clots were caused by hydrogel, and she linked to a post by Ana Maria Mihalcea who she claimed had successfully used intravenous EDTA to treat the blood of patients that was contaminated with hydrogel. [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-there-a-scientific-explanation>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-there-a-scientific-explanation</a>] The Stew crew also claims that EDTA is a chelating agent which is capable of removing graphene oxide from the body. But never mind that EDTA has been associated with leprechaunism: [<a href=https://x.com/FluoridePoison/status/1728498758894465518>https://x.com/FluoridePoison/status/1728498758894465518</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-leprechaun.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Latypova also did a video about hydrogel with David Nixon and Shimon Yanowitz. Her blog post about the video said: <span class="quote">"Shimon Yanowitz, a researcher from Israel joined me and David on a zoom call to observe in real time what happens with a common dental anesthetic injectable under microscope. The brand of anesthetic is Septodont and the product name is Lignospan. David placed a drop of it on a microscope slide and simply observed as it was drying. The process revealed that the substance is likely hydrogel due to the <span class="quote">'bubbling'</span> phenomenon as it dries. The process becomes more energetic when a cellphone is placed next to the sample."</span> [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under</a>]</p>
<p>Latypova also published a Substack post about how COVID vaccines contain hydrogel: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230712153341/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/more-on-the-issue-of-placebo-batches>http://web.archive.org/web/20230712153341/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/more-on-the-issue-of-placebo-batches</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am fairly certain that there were no saline placebo batches in broad commercial distribution (with exception of televised injections of government officials and dedicated Pfizer/Moderna employee batches). Here is why.</p>
<p>Vax substance visually looks different from normal saline, because it is formulated as a special type of hydrogel. Very likely it's what is called DARPA hydrogel, stuff that places like Robert Langer lab at MIT and Charles Lieber lab at Harvard work on.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Also, Melissa MacAtee, a whistleblower from Pfizer Chesterfield manufacturing facility reported this appearance of substance in vials. It glows opalescent blue, because it is a hydrogel:</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>She reported that Pfizer placed labels on vials unusually low to hide the substance, but it could still be visible when the product is handled anywhere in the supply chain. Therefore, if there were vials of saline amongst vials with hydrogel, someone would notice this. Too much risk of accidental detection by people who are not in on the scam.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>So, there could be a possibility that Pfizer <span class="quote">"dilutant"</span> is empty LNP (hydrogel). It is possible to formulate a thin version of hydrogel such that it looks like water. In the places where it was used people would get higher toxicity events and in other places where they got their own saline procured - would be lower toxicity.</p>
<p>My current conclusion is that all vials are hydrogel, and some contain more concentrated toxic biological materials (nucleic acid chains), plasmid DNA, toxic metals and other garbage. Empty hydrogel is not benign, but it also gets unevenly diluted during vaccination, and that results in another level of heterogeneity which explains why many people don't have any side effects. Some doses end up being mostly saline with a bit of hydrogel that does not cause much damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Substack post I quoted above, Latypova referred to the <span class="quote">"Pfizer whistleblower"</span> Melissa McAtee who is also known as Melissa Strickler. The earliest tweet about her I found was from October 2021, when she appeared on Project Veritas as a whistleblower who said that Pfizer jabs contain luciferace and graphene oxide. [<a href=https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-leaks-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-internal-emails-from-chief>https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-leaks-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-internal-emails-from-chief</a>] She was soon later interviewed by Candace Owens on DailyWire and by Mike Lindell's cohost Brannon Howse on Lindell TV, and an article about her was published by Red Voice Media, and next month she also appeared on Stew Peters. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22melissa+mcatee%22+until%3A2021-10-30&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22melissa+mcatee%22+until%3A2021-10-30&amp;f=live</a>] DailyWire is the outlet of the Jew Ben Shapiro, and Project Veritas is funded by Jews like Robert Shillman. [<a href=https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/some-funding-sources-of-conservative-project-veritas-also-fund-jewish-causes-515751>https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/some-funding-sources-of-conservative-project-veritas-also-fund-jewish-causes-515751</a>] Jane Ruby's bff Larry Loomer used to work for Project Veritas until 2017. In 2019 Zach Vorhies came out as a whistleblower on Project Veritas about how Google discriminates against conservatives, and he claimed that he received a text message from Q which said that he has guardian angels watching over him, but in 2018 he was the main eyewitness who was interviewed by the media about the YouTube HQ shooting, and his page at mylife.com used to say: <span class="quote">"Zachary's ethnicity is Caucasian Jew, whose political affiliation is currently a registered Classical Liberal Larper; and religious views are listed as Christian Larper."</span> [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423031655/https://www.mylife.com/zachary-vorhies/e910516938912>http://web.archive.org/web/20200423031655/https://www.mylife.com/zachary-vorhies/e910516938912</a>] Charles Johnson tweeted: <span class="quote">"I want to be fully on record that I saw Ben Shapiro receive tasking from Israeli intelligence connects to Netanyahu when I worked next to him at Breitbart.com. When I asked him about it he said he always kept close ties. It's time for Ben to register under FARA."</span> [<a href=https://archive.ph/BnXUz>https://archive.ph/BnXUz</a>]</p>
<p>Even though Latypova was trying to get people afraid of hydrogel like Kingston, Latypova was still saying that Kingston's story about graphene oxide was fake. Latypova wrote the following tweet about an article about graphene oxide by Expose News: <span class="quote">"This is based on a fake story in Expose which was fed to everyone by Karen Kingston. She designed that fake story knowingly, as she is competent enough to read the Pfizer report quoted and see it was not about the GO in the jab composition. this is how fake diversions are made"</span>.

The Pfizer document is unrelated to vax ingredients, it's just an imaging experiment where graphene is used for cryo-EM imaging set up. Karen Kingston mislead a bunch of good people. <a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/pfizer-evidence-of-graphene-oxide>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/pfizer-evidence-of-graphene-oxide</a>"</span>.

<p>Karen Kingston has also promoted the Stew psyops about hydras and snake venom. In 2021 Stew Peters asked Karen Kingston: <span class="quote">"So you are equivocally saying that hydra exists in this shots?"</span> Then she answered: <span class="quote">"Transgenic hydra does. So transgenic hydra is like a chimeric virus. It's when you take an organism and you artificially induce DNA from other organisms, other species, into that organism."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/NJqVMmI0b2DV/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/NJqVMmI0b2DV/</a>, time 7:25] The description of an episode of The Stew Peters Show from 2022 said: <span class="quote">"This segment of The Stew Peters Show brings on another researcher of the COVID-19 Snake Venom theory, Karen Kingston!

<p>In November 2022, Reiner Füllmich's <span class="quote">"International Crimes Investigative Committee"</span> hosted a panel where the main stars were Shimon Yanowitz and David Nixon, who claimed that they had used a light microscope to find self-assembling structures in their blood or in COVID vaccines. It was the first time when Mike Yeadon was featured as a co-host of Füllmich's panel, and another participant in the panel was Karen Kingston (even though to Yeadon's credit, he actually said in a polite way that the evidence presented by Nixon and Yanowitz was not very convincing): [<a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/icic-international-crimes-investigative>https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/icic-international-crimes-investigative</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>In September 2023, Latypova posted a Substack article where she recommended people to watch a video by Mat Taylor where he claimed that he was able to use a light microscope to see nanotechnology in COVID vaccines. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20231010011313/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/mat-taylor-provides-summary-of-microscopy>http://web.archive.org/web/20231010011313/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/mat-taylor-provides-summary-of-microscopy</a>] Latypova wrote that <span class="quote">"Mat Taylor is a true natural scientist in the original sense of the word"</span> and that his <span class="quote">"approach to understanding what is going on with covid injections is a valid one"</span>. Latypova included the following disclaimer in her Substack post, but she didn't have any other critical words about the video: <span class="quote">"My preference is not to call this <span class="quote">'nanotechnology'</span> (yet) because it is based on optical microscopy observations (not nano-scale). There should be more investigation at the actual nano-scale, and in addition, a chemistry/material science investigation."</span></p>
<p>David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor are all poor at doing presentations, they don't seem credible at all, and the objects in their microscope images don't look anything like nanotechnology. David Nixon sounds like he has Down's syndrome and it's hard to even understand what he says. The Three Microscope Stooges would've probably gotten almost no traction if they wouldn't have been promoted by people like Stew Peters, Reiner Füllmich, and Sasha Latypova.</p>
<p>When Jikkyleaks posted a Twitter thread about Jane Ruby, Latypova replied: <span class="quote">"I don't know what the <span class="quote">'correct'</span> position on GO and snake venom. Do you? These are open questions. Snake venom (and many other venoms) as synthetic peptides is backbone of medicinal chemistry for example."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1665017138447360000>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1665017138447360000</a>] Next she also said this about Jane Ruby: <span class="quote">"I have not seen her saying anything that's false. Please check your sources of information. If you have anything you can point to that she said was really not true, please let me know. Not just difference in opinion"</span>.

<p>At the end of Latypova's article about David Nixon's microchips, she wrote that the source of her article was a paper by David Hughes titled <span class="quote">"What is in the so-called COVID-19 <span class="quote">'Vaccines'</span>? Part 1: Evidence of a Global Crime Against Humanity"</span>. [<a href=https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119>https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119</a>] The paper was published in the fake journal IJVTPR which has published several other papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines. <a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52</a>]</p>
<p>In the paper Hughes presented microscope images by various researchers, which showed that vaccines contained structures like microchips, hydras, Morgellons fibers, nanoantennas, motherboards, graphene oxide razor blades, carbon nanotubes, nano-octopuses, mesospores, SIM cards, <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> parasites, hydrogel, microbubbles, long stick-like organisms, parasites attached to magnets, eggs that were hatching new structures, geometric structures that lit up when a mobile phone was used nearby, dark crystals, microelectric circuitry, and so on. And he wrote that the researchers must be onto something because <span class="quote">"at least 26 different investigations of the <span class="quote">'vaccine'</span> contents (almost entirely unrelated to one another) from 16 different countries on five continents converge on remarkably similar findings"</span>.</p>
<p>In 2022 Sucharit Bhakdi's organization Doctors for COVID Ethics hosted a symposium together with CHD and Solari. The symposium featured presentations by Catherine Austin Fitts, two other people from Solari, Sasha Latypova, and the nanobot propagandist trio of Daniel Broudy, David Hughes, and Valerie Kyrie. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-v-in-the-midst-of-darkness-light-prevails/>https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-v-in-the-midst-of-darkness-light-prevails/</a>] All members of the trio write for an online publication called Propaganda in Focus. The thumbnail of their presentation showed one of David Nixon's microscope images, and a followup article to their presentation was published by Catherine Austin Fitts. [<a href=https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/>https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/</a>]</p>
<p>A bio of Hughes says that he lectures in security studies and his areas of research include <span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span class="quote">"the class relations between psychological operations"</span>. [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>] Kyrie's bio says that she is <span class="quote">"working in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that her <span class="quote">"doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32</a>] Broudy used to serve in army intelligence but he is now an expert on propaganda. Broudy and Kyrie have also coauthored two papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines that were published by IJVTPR.</p>
<p>In 2024 Solari named David Hughes as their hero of the week. [<a href=https://solari.com/hero-of-the-week-april-29-2024-david-a-hughes/>https://solari.com/hero-of-the-week-april-29-2024-david-a-hughes/</a>] In 2024 Fitts interviewed Hughes about psychological warfare. [<a href=https://solari.com/navigating-psychological-and-neurological-warfare-with-dr-david-a-hughes/>https://solari.com/navigating-psychological-and-neurological-warfare-with-dr-david-a-hughes/</a>]</p>
<p>In 2024 and 2025, Fitts organized two <span class="quote">"Omniwar"</span> symposiums that were livestreamed by CHD, and that featured a similar cast of characters as the earlier symposiums that were organized by Doctors for COVID Ethics together with CHD and Solari. Both Omniwar symposiums featured presentations by David Hughes and Daniel Broudy. A tweet about the second symposium said: <span class="quote">"The Solari Report and Catherine, collaborating with the four members of the Study Group on Technology and Power - technocracy expert Patrick Wood (<span class="citation" data-cites="StopTechnocracy">@StopTechnocracy</span>) and scholars David A. Hughes, Lissa Johnson, and Daniel Broudy - have been working hard to raise awareness of the Omniwar that Mr. Global is waging, at full throttle, against the world's populations."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/solari_the/status/1919522538104742312>https://x.com/solari_the/status/1919522538104742312</a>] The thumbnail for a video of the symposium featured one of David Nixon's microchips that was presented by David Hughes: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6srfl9-omniwar-symposium-ii-battle-for-the-brain-april-26-2025.html>https://rumble.com/v6srfl9-omniwar-symposium-ii-battle-for-the-brain-april-26-2025.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-omniwar.png width=650>
</div>
<p>The Omniwar symposium also featured a presentation about nanotechnology by Lissa Johnson, whose bio says: <span class="quote">"Dr. Lissa Johnson is an independent researcher who writes about the psychological aspects of public affairs, psychological operations, human rights abuse, citizenship, and the exercise and abuse of power. Her qualifications include undergraduate degrees in media studies and in behavioural science, with an honours thesis in neuroimmunology, an MA in clinical psychology, and a PhD on the psychological processes involved in manipulating reality-perception."</span> [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/author/r_f29phidn_84_al7q/>https://propagandainfocus.com/author/r_f29phidn_84_al7q/</a>] So she even did her PhD degree on the manipulation of reality perception just like Valerie Kyrie.</p>
<p>In 2020 Catherine Austin Fitts published a book review where she praised the book <em>The Contagion Myth</em> by Tom Cowan and Sally Fallon Morell. [<a href=https://solari.com/book-review-the-contagion-myth-why-viruses-including-coronavirus-are-not-the-cause-of-disease/>https://solari.com/book-review-the-contagion-myth-why-viruses-including-coronavirus-are-not-the-cause-of-disease/</a>] Her YouTube channel also published a series of presentations about the no-virus theory by Jon Rappoport in April 2020.

Its main star was Catherine Austin Fitts but it also featured David Martin. [<a href=https://arlingtoninstitute.org/transitiontalks/past-speakers/>https://arlingtoninstitute.org/transitiontalks/past-speakers/</a>]</p>
<p>David Martin did many of his earliest appearances in alt media together with Sacha Stone, but Sacha Stone was one of the first big names in alt media who started to say that viruses are not real. Around 2010 both Martin and Stone were members of the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Organization. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20100601012359/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=team&ref=sec>http://web.archive.org/web/20100601012359/http://www.ireoigo.org/index.php?pageID=team&amp;ref=sec</a>] In 2010 when Sacha Stone's Humanitad Foundation and IREO jointly launched an <span class="quote">"Exemplar Zero Initiative"</span>, David Martin hosted an event in New York which celebrated the initiative.

<p>In May 2022 Jane Ruby organized an event at Palm Beach called <span class="quote">"Pharmaceutical Insider Expose"</span>, where the speakers consisted of David Martin, Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, and Mike Yeadon: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20220503133508/https://truthaboutbigpharma.wordpress.com/>http://web.archive.org/web/20220503133508/https://truthaboutbigpharma.wordpress.com/</a>]</p>
<div>

<p>Sasha Latypova's company iCardiac conducted clinical trials, but David Martin was also the president of a company called Mosaic Tech which worked with clinical trials.

<p>In July 2023 David Martin did an interview with Alec Zeck where he said that viruses are not real, that nucleic acids are not real, that DNA is not real, and that atoms are not real. [<a href=https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936>https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck?video_id=936</a>, <a href=https://expose-news.com/2023/08/10/there-was-no-sars-cov2-disease-just-a-set-of-symptoms-and-a-branding-campaign-dr-david-martin/>https://expose-news.com/2023/08/10/there-was-no-sars-cov2-disease-just-a-set-of-symptoms-and-a-branding-campaign-dr-david-martin/</a>] During the interview, Alec Zeck said: <span class="quote">"So just to be clear here, so when we're talking about a virus - I'm not talking about the previous definition of poison, I'm talking about a tiny replication-competent obligate intracellular parasite consisting of a genome surrounded by a protein coat that is an infectious particle."</span> [39:50] And Martin told him: <span class="quote">"All bulls**t, 100% bulls**t."</span> Next David Martin said: <span class="quote">"DNA does not exist."</span> [42:41] Then Alec Zeck replied: <span class="quote">"I don't disagree with that."</span> And Martin said: <span class="quote">"It doesn't."</span> David Martin also said: <span class="quote">"There are no atoms, there never have been, and there never will be."</span> [44:52] And next he said: <span class="quote">"The model of an atom then gives rise to the model of a thing we call a nucleic acid.

</h2>
<p>On the howbad.info website, the members of Team Enigma are listed as Mike Yeadon, Alexandra Latypova, Craig Paardekooper, Walter Wagner, and Jessica Rose (in that order). [<a href=https://www.howbad.info/background.html>https://www.howbad.info/background.html</a>]</p>
<p>Around two months before Latypova presented Team Enigma's data on the Stew Peters Show in January 2022, Expose News published two articles about Team Enigma's findings. The first article was titled <span class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - 100% of Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of the batches produced according to official Government data"</span>, and the second article was titled <span class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - VAERS data shows 100% of reported Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of batches produced and the majority were sent to red Republican States across the USA"</span>. [<a href=https://expose-news.com/2021/10/31/100-percent-of-covid-19-vaccine-deaths-caused-by-just-5-percent-of-the-batches-produced/comment-page-1/>https://expose-news.com/2021/10/31/100-percent-of-covid-19-vaccine-deaths-caused-by-just-5-percent-of-the-batches-produced/comment-page-1/</a>, <a href=https://expose-news.com/2021/11/03/majority-deadliest-batches-of-covid-19-vaccine-were-sent-to-red-republican-states/>https://expose-news.com/2021/11/03/majority-deadliest-batches-of-covid-19-vaccine-were-sent-to-red-republican-states/</a>]</p>
<p>In October 2021 Steve Kirsch emailed the other article by Expose News to WelcomeTheEagle88, Jessica Rose, and Mathew Crawford, after which they started investigating the data, and WelcomeTheEagle88 emailed Craig Paardekooper about some errors in the data. [<a href=https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/jj-couey-george-webb-latypova-hot>https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/jj-couey-george-webb-latypova-hot</a>] Then WelcomeTheEagle88 wrote that afterwards Yeadon joined Team Enigma through Kirsch's circle: <span class="quote">"It was shortly after this that Mike Yeadon was putting his feelers out basically looking for Team Enigma through Steve Kirsch and friends. I can't find the email, but I actually responded to Dr. Yeadon, I actually thought he was looking for me?"</span> WelcomeTheEagle88 also wrote: <span class="quote">"it was Team Enigma aka Craig Paardekooper and Sasha Latypova that were first out of the gate with lot# number analysis and then the help of Dr. Mike Yeadon, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, and Reiner Fuellmich the story and Team Enigma launched"</span>.</p>
<p>Latypova also said that she was in contact with Kirsch in 2021 (even though at that point I believe she hadn't appeared anywhere on alt media): <span class="quote">"I told Steve the product was adulterated in 2021, he dismissed me and my analysis as <span class="quote">'conspiracy'</span>, he actually used that word."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1716113671955354057>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1716113671955354057</a>]</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon said: <span class="quote">"I was at the scene of the accident. The person who did the work originally was a British guy called Craig Paardekooper, Craig Paardekooper. And Sasha Latypova and Mike Yeadon saw this and we made a b-line [?] for him. And that's how Sasha, Mike, and Craig met. So I didn't make any contribution to the analysis, except to say it cannot be tolerable that we have this degree of batch-to-batch variation."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5b8FB1FhY0&t=47m15m>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5b8FB1FhY0&amp;t=47m15m</a>]</p>
<p>I believe Jane Ruby had also discussed the articles by Expose News in 2021 before she interviewed Latypova in January 2022, so I don't know if that's how she came to be connected to Team Enigma and Latypova. However at the start of one of Jane Ruby's interviews with Latypova, Ruby said: <span class="quote">"My guest today is someone very special, who I've worked with really since the beginning of the entire COVID scam in 2020."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/</a>, time 14:53] That was news to me, because I haven't found any references to Latypova in alt media before 2022. So did she do her debut interview with Stew Peters and Jane Ruby because she had known Jane Ruby long before then? Ruby and Latypova have both talked about how they know a lot people in the pharmaceutical industry because they used to work for the industry, so is that also how they knew each other?</p>
<p>In May 2021 when Jane Ruby was a guest host for Owen Shroyer's War Room show, she also interviewed WelcomeTheEagle88 about VAERS data. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/iwW55F7hHdmw/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/iwW55F7hHdmw/</a>]</p>
<p>Expose News is kind of a shady outlet, or it appears to be like the British equivalent of Red Voice Media's news site, because both of them have published a large number of articles about stories that are covered on the Stew Peters Network. For example Expose News has published articles about David Nixon's story that COVID vaccines contain self-assembling microchips, Bryan Ardis's story that COVID is caused by snake venom in the tap water and that COVID jabs contain snake venom, and Carrie Madej's story that COVID jabs contain hydras.

<p>Jessica Rose might also be a Jew, because she lives in Israel and she got her PhD degree and two post-doctoral degrees from universities at Israel.

<p>Craig Paardekooper has written a book about Jesus titled <span class="quote">"The Sign of the Son of Man"</span>.

<p>La Quinta Columna is the Spanish group which supposedly first found out that COVID jabs contain graphene oxide, but Jane Ruby brags about how she was the first to break La Quinta Columna's story in English-language media, and she also says that she broke the news about Richard Hirschman's kalamari clots: [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338</a>, <a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952</a>]</p>

<p>If the kalamari clots were caused by COVID vaccines, then why was the story about the kalamari clots breaking news more than a year after the jabs had been rolled out? When I searched Twitter for <code>embalmer clot until:2022-1-27</code>, I didn't find any references to the kalamari clots that predated Hirschman's interview with Jane Ruby.

<p>Jane Ruby also tweeted that she was the first to find Richard Hirschman <span class="quote">"through a source"</span>: <span class="quote">"That is my story, that is the story upon which that movie/documentary was made and I was left out.

<p>I believe Steve Kirsch was the second person in alt media after Jane Ruby who interviewed Richard Hirschman. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=richard%20hirschman>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=richard%20hirschman</a>] Kirsch has published two surveys about the kalamari clots that were done by Tom Haviland who is a retired Major General in the Air Force. In the second survey published in 2024, 197 out of the 269 embalmers surveyed are supposed to have answered yes to a question that asked if they had seen the kalamari clots in corpses that they embalmed in the year 2023. [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/embalmer-survey-2023-over-75-are>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/embalmer-survey-2023-over-75-are</a>] Theresa Long was described as <span class="quote">"an aviation safety officer and Army flight surgeon"</span>, so it's interesting that she and Haviland have both served in the Air Force. There's a viral video about fake DMED data that was a clip of a presentation Pam Long whose bio says that she <span class="quote">"served as a medical intelligence officer for NATO Stabilization Forces"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/toobaffled/status/1823839301484089807>https://x.com/toobaffled/status/1823839301484089807</a>, <a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/pam-long/>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/pam-long/</a>]</p>
<p>Kirsch also posted the list below which was purported to show a quarterly percentage of embalming cases with the new type of clots seen by Richard Hirschman. But it seems like made up data similar to Kirsch's data from the anonymous military doctor, and Kirsch didn't even provide any methodology or details of how the percentages were calculated (and if really a new type of clots was seen in about half of dead people, then why wouldn't it be mentioned in genuine scientific publications?): [<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1883344288467357848>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1883344288467357848</a>]</p>

<p>Kirsch also did a video with Tom Haviland where they interviewed a couple of people who were said to be funeral directors or embalmers. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4c2e79-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html>https://rumble.com/v4c2e79-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html</a>] Some guy who was presented as an embalmer named Bill said that he started seeing the kalamari clots around July or August 2021: <span class="quote">"Prior to this - I mean, I've been an embalmer over 30 years - I had never ever seen this - prior to, I'm gonna say July or August of 2021."</span> [time 31:12] Kirsch also asked an embalmer called Lorin Ware <span class="quote">"And you started seeing them in mid-2021?"</span> But she answered <span class="quote">"Yes sir"</span>, and then Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"Was it like a light switch turning on, or did it happen pretty gradually?"</span> And she answered that <span class="quote">"It was like a light switch turning on."</span> [time 26:00] But if everyone started suddenly seeing the clots in mid-2021 then how come no-one was speaking out about them until January 2022?</p>
<p>John O'Looney is a funeral director who was interviewed in the Died Suddenly film. During an interview in 2024 John Campbell asked John O'Looney when he first started seeing the new type of blood clots. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&t=10s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&amp;t=10s</a>] Then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"So, really, in 2021, about halfway through, we started seeing lots and lots of people who were passing away suddenly, who were a lot younger than those that we were used to."</span> And a bit later O'Looney said this about the kalamari clots: <span class="quote">"I've got a BIE-registered embalmer who works for me fulltime, who's done 22 years, and he's never seen them before, uh, 2021, no."</span> And then Campbell said: <span class="quote">"So some people have think they've seen some small ones in 2020, but that's not your experience: it's 2021 they started, midway through 2021."</span> And then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"Yes, 100%, yeah."</span></p>
<p>However I didn't find O'Looney mentioning the kalamari clots anywhere in 2021. During an interview that he did on September 30th 2021, the only time he mentioned blood clots was when he said: <span class="quote">"Children will get cardio issues, inflammation of the heart. There will be blood clots and all the things I'm seeing as a funeral director. Now as a funeral director I'm seeing four main causes of death coming into me now. I'm seeing heart attack and stroke as a result of blood clot. And I'm seeing multiple organ failure. And these are all the things that the scientists laid out and explained the science for."</span> [<a href=https://antijantepodden.com/.ajp_enep026.html>https://antijantepodden.com/.ajp_enep026.html</a>, 24:59] But he didn't mention anything about white rubbery kalamari clots even though the interview was done on the last day of September, so it was already much more than halfway through 2021. And also in a video that O'Looney did in December 2021, he said: <span class="quote">"We used to see a blood clot very very rarely, but now I've seen more this year than I have in the previous 14."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/</a>, time 0:58] But he didn't say anything about white fibrous clots even though he said he has seen a lot of clots. In another interview of O'Looney dated September 1st 2021, he didn't mention any kind of clots. [<a href=https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html>https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html</a>]</p>
<p>There were 16 tweets which matched the search phrase <code>from:olooneyjohn until:2021-12-31 clot</code> but none of them mentioned anything about white rubbery kalamari clots. [<a href=https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aolooneyjohn%20until%3A2021-12-31%20clot&f=live>https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aolooneyjohn%20until%3A2021-12-31%20clot&amp;f=live</a>] But I coincidentally found that in July 2021 O'Looney posted a TikTok video of a guy who was supposed to be a 5G installer, who showed that he was told to install kits to 5G towers which he was told to not crack open, but when he tried opening one kit it contained a circuit which said <span class="quote">"COV-19"</span>. [<a href=https://twitter.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1419982639415631873>https://twitter.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1419982639415631873</a>] Then O'Looney posted this comment: <span class="quote">"Just imagine having the ability to induce blood clots and vaccine recipients over Wi-Fi…"</span> However Reuters said this about the video: <span class="quote">"The circuit board was actually taken from a Virgin Media box for cable television - the casing of which can be seen on the bonnet of the van as the camera pans at the end of the footage. Virgin Media confirmed to Reuters it believed the circuit board had been taken from an old TV box, and the <span class="quote">'COV-19'</span> engraving was not authentic."</span> [<a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/>https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/</a>] So it might be that the people who made the video even left the casing of the box visible so the video would be easier to debunk.</p>
<p>Many anti-vaxxers on Twitter suspect O'Looney of being controlled opposition who is attempting to discredit anti-vaxxers: [<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1804717634270978122>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1804717634270978122</a>]</p>

<p>Richard Hirschman posted a video on Twitter with this description: <span class="quote">"This is a video of me removing one of the strange white fibrous clots, from the right jugular vein. The person who was recording it is Nicky King, who is also an embalmer. I didn't notice it until I lifted the vessel up. I could feel it inside the vein. I only show this because people still don't believe it and ask for video evidence. What's causing this? I can't say for sure, but I didn't start seeing this until early 2021. Unfortunately, I still find strange clotting in several bodies that I embalm."</span> [<a href=https://twitter.com/r_hirschman/status/1759337235042758748>https://twitter.com/r_hirschman/status/1759337235042758748</a>] However the video looked like a carotid endarterectomy where atherosclerotic plague was removed from the carotid artery (or maybe a jugular vein which runs next to the carotid artery). [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_endarterectomy>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_endarterectomy</a>] Carotid plaques have a similar light yellowish color as the supposed kalamari clots.</p>
<p>Richard Hirschman was the main star of the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> film by Stew Peters. The main theme of the film were the long fibrous clots that were allegedly found by embalmers and funeral directors. The credits of the <span class="quote">"Watch the Water"</span> film say that the film was written, produced, directed, filmed, and edited by Matthew Miller Skow and Nicholas Stumphauzer. [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/04/world-premiere-watch-the-water/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/04/world-premiere-watch-the-water/</a>] The credits of the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> film say that the film was directed by Stew Peters, edited by Nicholas Stumphauzer, and produced by Lauren Witzke. [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/live-world-premiere-died-suddenly/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/live-world-premiere-died-suddenly/</a>] Lauren Witzke was formerly the producer of the Stew Peters Show and the president of the Stew Peters Network. So basically the Died Suddenly film was a sequel to a film which claimed that COVID was caused by snake venom in tap water.</p>
<p>The Died Suddenly film also includes a video of basketball player Keyontae Johnson collapsing, but he collapsed on December 12th 2020. [<a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/15/sport/florida-gators-player-breathing-talking/index.html>https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/15/sport/florida-gators-player-breathing-talking/index.html</a>] At time 47:45, the film features a video of a man falling off a chair but it's from January 2020. [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/answering-the-critics-of-died-suddenly>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/answering-the-critics-of-died-suddenly</a>] At time 52:33 the film features a video of a pulmonary embolectomy from 2019. [<a href=https://x.com/thereal_truther/status/1596560239247364096>https://x.com/thereal_truther/status/1596560239247364096</a>]</p>
<p>In October 2023, Bryan Ardis did a viral 2-hour interview with Jason Shurka titled <span class="quote">"The Antidote: The Explosive Truth, Origin, and Antidote for C19"</span>. [<a href=https://www.unifydhealing.com/antidote>https://www.unifydhealing.com/antidote</a>] The page for the interview on Shurka's website also promotes Shurka's UNIFYD Healing centers, where people are made to look at computer monitors which display a colorful graphical pattern, but which UNIFYD says incorporate an <span class="quote">"Energy Enhancement System"</span> technology which produces morphogenetic energy fields, scalar waves, and biophotons.

[<a href=https://www.eesystem.com/eeqube-from-eesystem/>https://www.eesystem.com/eeqube-from-eesystem/</a>] The description of Shurka's interview with Ardis also said that <span class="quote">"TLS has been closely monitoring Dr. Ardis's progress over the past year and supports his efforts to disseminate this vital information to a global audience."</span> The TLS stands for <span class="quote">"The Light System"</span> which is supposedly a thousand-year old <span class="quote">"undercover organization for the betterment of humanity"</span> that Shurka says is like a <span class="quote">"spiritual CIA"</span>. Shurka says that he was chosen to be a messenger of the TLS and that his mentor Ray is a member of the TLS. There's two books that were published under Shurka's name but that were supposedly written by Ray. Both books are supposed to have been originally written in Hebrew, and in the other book called <span class="quote">"The Pyramid Code"</span>, Ray said that he was taken to an extraterrestiral planet called Nashia by Rabbi AA who is <span class="quote">"a 424-year-old human being with immense spiritual and supernatural abilities"</span>. [<a href=https://www.jasonshurka.com/thepyramidcode>https://www.jasonshurka.com/thepyramidcode</a>] Shurka has Yemenite Jewish and Persian Jewish ancestry, and he and his parents are members of the Chabad of Port Washington, or at least they used to be until recently.

[<a href=https://nationwidewalkout.com>https://nationwidewalkout.com</a>] Simone Gold is a Jew, the news team of AFLDS is based in Israel, and the head of their news team is the Israeli Chabadnik Mordechai Sones, who also hosts their podcast and who recommends everyone to read Meir Kahane's books on Twitter.

Today we are left with fewer than 100,000 pyramids of different shapes and sizes."</span> [<a href=https://www.jasonshurka.com/thepyramidcode>https://www.jasonshurka.com/thepyramidcode</a>] Shurka's book <span class="quote">"Rays of Knowledge"</span> says: <span class="quote">"After the publication of <span class="quote">'The Pyramid Code,'</span> I received questions from people all around the world asking me why the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, who were such high-vibrational beings, associated the pyramids with a satanic and evil number. Well, 666 is not an evil number! On the contrary, the reason why the pharaohs incorporated such a number into their way of life is because they understood its true meaning, which is <span class="quote">'life.'</span> In order to understand why this is so, I must first explain the concept on <span class="quote">'gematria,'</span> which is a concept the extraterrestrials who built the pyramids understood on a very deep level."</span> [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220721002713/https://unifyd.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rays-of-Knowledge-PDF.pdf>https://web.archive.org/web/20220721002713/https://unifyd.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rays-of-Knowledge-PDF.pdf</a>] In 2021, Children's Health Defense organized an event called <span class="quote">"Broadway Rally for Freedom"</span>, where a press release published by the CHD said that in addition to RFK and CHD's legal director Mary Holland, speakers at the event included <span class="quote">"Dr. Larry Palevsky, Kevin Jenkins, Christiane Northrup, Patricia Finn and Jason Shurka"</span>.

<p>The description of one episode of the Jane Ruby Show said: <span class="quote">"On today's Dr. Jane Ruby Show, Dr. Jane interviews Counter-bioterrorism expert Dr. Tau Braun who explains that self-replicating nanoparticles in the C19 shots are programmed to grow venom ducts inside the human body. His theory is that the jabbed are growing live venom gland cells and other animal structures. Dr. Jane shows you the DOJ's research using cone snail venom to make huge amounts of deadly synthetic conotoxins. They say that deep ocean cone snail venom is a serious threat to humans who never dive that deep!"</span> [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/</a>] At time 8:50 when Jane Ruby introduced Tau Braun, she said: <span class="quote">"He has worked with many of the experts you have already seen on the Jane Ruby Show, like Sasha Latypova of Team Enigma, Bryan Ardis, and so many more."</span> (How come Latypova has worked together with so many ridiculous people who are connected to Stew Peters, like Tau Braun, David Nixon, and Shimon Yanowitz?) During the interview Tau Braun said that people were wondering if COVID jabs contain snake venom or if they contain graphene oxide, but he said they contain both because the graphene oxide acts as a delivery mechanism for the snake venom. At time 13:18, he said: <span class="quote">"How do you get venom into the body and how do you keep it stable? You add graphene oxide."</span> At time 40:33, Tau Braun said that the kalamari clots consist of tissue which contains snake venom ducts: <span class="quote">"Those monstrous clot-looking things are literally tissue that has grown a duct - and specialized ducts - the closest match I found to these fibrotic clots today is the chameleon tongue - it's the long, very very - extremely - it has what's called the tensile strength, it has elasticity to it. But it's extremely strong. Cause it has to whip out like a whip and it has to come back in, and so it has to have expansion at rapid speed, and it has to be able to go back. So it's like elastic."</span> At time 17:40, Tau Braun said that if there is a species of snake that eats rodents, then the snake won't produce venom which affects amphibians but only venom which affects rodents, and then he said that in the same way the snake venom in the COVID vaccines was designed to not affect Aryans because the COVID jabs are a race-specific bioweapon that was created by the Fourth Reich: <span class="quote">"So why are certain people totally fine from this? I'm gonna tell you that this was built by the Fourth Reich, and I'm gonna tell you that Aryans are not having a problem with this vaccine. I'm gonna tell you that you can stick this into an Aryan over and over… and what I mean by Aryan? I mean people that originally came from Viking heritage, Germanic heritage, and that basically you can go and look at those principles of what Nazis believe the superior race to be. And I'm gonna tell you this weapon was not built for them."</span> Tau Braun later also said that the Aryans were planning to kill off nine tenths of humanity. Tau Braun looks like a Middle Easterner, and he seems like a Jew based on some of his posts about Jews on social media, because for example in December 2020 he published a Facebook post which featured a photo of a Jewish passover plate and which included the following text: <span class="quote">"Fun fact the Passover Plate (built for plague in Egypt) has everything on it for Covid Prevention […] Charoset - a sweet, dark-colored paste made of fruits and nuts - Egyptian Jews make it from dates, raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and sweet wine. […] Said in yiddish voice, <span class="quote">'And vee need Pfizer?

[<a href=https://www.drtaubraun.com/about>https://www.drtaubraun.com/about</a>] So it's interesting that he has a background in emergency management like Celeste Solum and Cyrus Parsa.</p>
<p>During Jane Ruby's interview with Tau Braun, she also mentioned that she was friends in DC with someone who used to work in intelligence: <span class="quote">"I had a friend in D.C. - we went out to - you know, he was intelligence under the Reagan thing - but he was very, former intelligence."</span> [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts/</a>, time 20:05] Until 2020 Jane Ruby used to live in DC where there's a huge number of spooks per capita.</p>
<p>I believe the story that COVID vaccines contain hydras was first presented by Carrie Madej on the Stew Peters Show in September 2021.

This means the Hydra's are being genetically modified before they're injected into humans. The good doctor also identified parasites in the vials.</p>

<p>Carrie Madej did an interview with the Chabadnik Jason Shurka, where she claimed that was able to heal from a plane crash by using the Energy Enhancement System technology that is employed at Shurka's UNIFYD Healing centers. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAMtAADC_KQ&t=12m58s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAMtAADC_KQ&amp;t=12m58s</a>] Madej has said that she uses the Messianic Jewish Bible, and she posted a photo on Instagram which showed a page from the New Testament in the Complete Jewish Bible. [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40TheZionistInspector:0/YouCut_20220808_061637448>https://odysee.com/%40TheZionistInspector:0/YouCut_20220808_061637448</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CbSh525OyaT/>https://www.instagram.com/p/CbSh525OyaT/</a>] In 2015, Richard Hirschman updated his Facebook cover photo to a photo which displayed the Messianic Jewish Family Bible and a booklet called <span class="quote">"Celebrating the Sabbath: The Messianic Jewish Way"</span>. [<a href=https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=730445680433744&set=ecnf.100004049568699>https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=730445680433744&amp;set=ecnf.100004049568699</a>] I believe Celeste Solum was the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel, but she is also a Messianic Jew.</p>
<p>The hydras are also supposed to have been found by La Quinta Columna. An article by Expose News said: <span class="quote">"Using optical microscopy, La Quinta Columna finds the famous <span class="quote">'nano-octopus'</span> that appeared in the Pfizer vaccine vial analysed by Dr. Campra, observed by Dr. Carrie Madej under the microscope, and also found by the Polish scientist Dr. Franc Zalewksi."</span> [<a href=https://expose-news.com/2021/12/23/pfizer-injection-contents-la-quinta-columna-confirms-findings-of-polish-scientist-and-dr-carrie-madej/>https://expose-news.com/2021/12/23/pfizer-injection-contents-la-quinta-columna-confirms-findings-of-polish-scientist-and-dr-carrie-madej/</a>]</p>
<p>Ariana Love was one of the main people who was pushing the story that COVID jabs contain an octopus-like creature called <em>Hydra vulgaris</em>. In December 2022 Ariana Love also appeared on the Stew Peters Show saying that PCR tests are used to clone humans: <span class="quote">"Love claimed that <span class="quote">'PCR kits have never been about testing for COVID […] They're cloning devices'</span>. To support her claim, Love cited a study from 2015 by Hoseini and Sauer titled 'Molecular cloning using polymerase chain reaction, an educational guide for cellular engineering'[1]. Love's reasoning is that the article described the use of PCR to perform molecular cloning. Given that COVID-19 detection kits used on humans also rely on PCR, she concluded that the kits must be human cloning devices."</span> [<a href=https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/pcr-covid-19-tests-arent-cloning-devices-dont-modify-human-genome-ariyana-love-stew-peters/>https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/pcr-covid-19-tests-arent-cloning-devices-dont-modify-human-genome-ariyana-love-stew-peters/</a>, <a href=https://rumble.com/v1gh8dp-patent-pcr-test-linked-to-human-cloning-video-shows-animal-experiments-cros.html>https://rumble.com/v1gh8dp-patent-pcr-test-linked-to-human-cloning-video-shows-animal-experiments-cros.html</a>] In an interview with Age of Truth TV, Ariana Love said that there's a Galactic Federation of 82 species of aliens, and that the above the Galactic Federation is the Universal Council: <span class="quote">"They're okay - I think that they were were white hats working with the Galactic Federation, if you ask me. And I do believe there are benign forces in the universe, um, there is even a higher hierarchy above the Galactic Federation, which is called the Universal Council, and these are geneticists. They populate worlds. The galactic federation is like a police force. They're interested in using their technologies to save species on worlds that are being attacked and subjugated by the fallen. […] Yes. And earth is one of them. We're the 83rd. […] There were 82 species - even Paul Hellyer talked about this - there's there's 82 species in the Galactic Federation - earth is the 83rd - and I believe the Pleiadians are part of it too."</span> [<a href=https://ageoftruth.tv/new-live-stream-19-dec-2021-the-love-doctor-the-devils-alien-monster/>https://ageoftruth.tv/new-live-stream-19-dec-2021-the-love-doctor-the-devils-alien-monster/</a>, time 55:00] There seems to be a lot of crossover between the Stew Peters Network and the various operations of Reiner Füllmich, because Ariana Love also gave an hour-long presentation about graphene oxide to Füllmich's Corona Investigative Committee. [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/s116en%3ab>https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/s116en%3ab</a>]</p>
<p>In 2021, La Quinta Columna published videos where they said that vaccinated parents had <span class="quote">"pandemic babies"</span> who appeared to have completely or almost completely black eyes, and the babies were also developing rapidly so that they were able to walk when they were 3 months old or crawl when they were 2 weeks old. [<a href=https://www.orwell.city/2021/09/black-eyed-babies.html>https://www.orwell.city/2021/09/black-eyed-babies.html</a>] The videos were typical of Stew ops in the sense that they had high visual shock value so they could be easily conveyed to low-IQ people through images or short video clips, just like the stories about the kalamari clots, vaccinated people being magnetic, self-assembling structures found under the microscope, and Melissa McAtee's story that vaccine vials glowed in the dark because they contained luciferase:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-blackeyed.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Apart from the black-eyed-babies, another forgotten episode in COVID history is that in 2021 La Quinta Columna was saying that vaccinated women had black period blood that contained black clots. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/</a>] First a guy from La Quinta Columna said that they had received a letter from their viewer which said: <span class="quote">"Dr. Sevillano, does the Moderna vaccine cause irregular periods and black bleeding clots? My 17-year-old daughter was given a dose of that poison, and now she's with bleeding out of the normal cycle, with black blood and black clots. It's been two months since she was vaccinated. Thank you, and go ahead. We are all La Quinta Columna. I know it."</span> And then the guy from La Quinta Columna answered that it was correct and the symptoms were caused by the vaccine. But for some reason the story about the white kalamari clots seems to have stuck but everyone forgot about the black clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-black-period.jpg width=200>
</div>
<p>Another forgotten episode is that in 2021 before the story about the kalamari clots had been rolled out, Carrie Madej was saying that vaccinated people were growing hydra clots (which makes it seem like they were generating new stories by just combining concepts selected by a random generator): [<a href=https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/>https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-hydraclots.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Carrie Madej told Stew that the clots might actually consist of hydras: <span class="quote">"Let's just look at these water parasites. These things have the potential to grow, and be innumerable, right. If you're growing things, it has the potential to clog your arteries, it can clog capillaries, it can clog lymphatics. So we see blood clotting happening, and plus the body's response to having an infection, or a parasitic invasion, right, would be an inflammatory response, would be to have inflammation, which perhaps clotting an area."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/CU7FTZwr54yP/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/CU7FTZwr54yP/</a>, time 12:12] And then the video cut off to the photo of the clot above, and Madej said: <span class="quote">"So, they're pulling clots sometimes out too that's almost as big as my hand, you know, has finger-like extensions coming from let's say the heart."</span> (I think during the interview Carrie Madej didn't actually say that the clot in the photo came from a heart or that it came from an <span class="quote">"early teen"</span>, but I don't know if she said it somewhere else or if it's something that Ariana Love made up. And the photo of the clot wasn't necessarily even provided by Madej but Stew's production crew could've just inserted it into the video as an example of a blood clot.)</p>
<p>When I searched Google Images for <span class="quote">"bronchial cast"</span>, the image that was shown during Carrie Madej's interview with Stew was one of the top results, complete with the arrows. But the article with the image was published in 2018: [<a href=https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/>https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/</a>]</p>

<p>The standard Stew op is that strange objects are found in COVID vaccines or in the blod of vaccinated people. One time Stew Peters wrote on Gettr that COVID vaccines contained gorilla feces and Neanderthal DNA. The Gettr post included a video of the FEMA whistleblower Celeste Solumn, who I believe was the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel long before the vaccines had even been rolled out: [<a href=https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7>https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7</a>]</p>

[<a href=https://i.imgur.com/Sb35SXc.png>https://i.imgur.com/Sb35SXc.png</a>, <a href=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9UoBRJXEAAeQ82?format=jpg>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9UoBRJXEAAeQ82?format=jpg</a>, <a href=i/gavin-mcinnes-rainbow-star-david.jpg>i/gavin-mcinnes-rainbow-star-david.jpg</a>] I don't know if McInnes was sitting at his own studios or the studios of InfoWars. But I don't think the screenshots are photoshopped, because I found two different different screenshots which both displayed the same image mounted on the wall, and when I searched for the other screenshot on TinEye, I found a third screenshot which was hosted at YouTube because it was used as the thumbnail of a YouTube video, and it was probably used as the thumbnail of a video by Prison Planet TV because it was indexed from a page which featured other videos by Prison Planet TV.

</h2>
<p>In January 2022 when Yeadon did a presentation about Team Enigma's findings for Füllmich's committee, he said: <span class="quote">"As an undergraduate, I worked under military clearance at Porton Down. That's the equivalent of Fort Detrick, it's where the UK military develops its so-called chemical defences. So I was under the Official Secrets Act. They must have thought I wasn't a crazy person at the time. I also worked for six months at the Police Forensic Service headquarters at Aldermaston, so I learned a lot of analytical techniques in that time."</span> [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en?t=135>https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en?t=135</a>, <a href=https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies>https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies</a>] In an expert testimony that Mike Yeadon provided for America's Frontline Doctors, he wrote: <span class="quote">"I have had Government security clearance and worked placements at top-secret facilities at Porton Down (Chemical Defence Establishment) and Aldermaston (Forensic Science Service HQ)."</span> [<a href=https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AFLDS-v-UC-9th-Circuit-Writ-Filed-1.pdf>https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AFLDS-v-UC-9th-Circuit-Writ-Filed-1.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>In an open letter in 2024, Mike Yeadon wrote: <span class="quote">"Part of my undergraduate training involved research placements at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down, Wiltshire, where I was a small cog in the long term development of injected antidotes for nerve gas poisoning to protect British troops."</span> [<a href=https://www.muftisays.com/forums/96-covid19/14893-open-letter-from-mike-yeadon-to-metropolitan-police.html>https://www.muftisays.com/forums/96-covid19/14893-open-letter-from-mike-yeadon-to-metropolitan-police.html</a>] But I don't know if it was just a cover story that he was developing antidotes against nerve agents, like how bioweapon developers are always saying that they are developing vaccines against viruses or they are trying to prevent the next pandemic.</p>
<p>It might be that Yeadon only worked at Porton Down for a short time as a college student, but if he already had a military clearance when he was a college student, it increases the likelihood that he was later also involved in other kinds of work which required a security clearance, or that he was recruited to be part of some intelligence network when he was in college.</p>
<p>Nick Redfern has written that Porton Down was home to experiments where British military personnel were unwittingly subjected to LSD in the 1950s, and he also written that the Rendelsham Forest UFO incident may have been a psychological operation that was staged by people from Porton Down who subjected the witnesses of the incident to psychoactive drugs. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcqiF3NhXdg&t=11m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcqiF3NhXdg&amp;t=11m54s</a>, <a href=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2022/12/The-Rendlesham-Forest-UFO-Incident-s-Some-of-the-Top-Secret-Lesser-known-Parts-of-the-Story/>https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2022/12/The-Rendlesham-Forest-UFO-Incident-s-Some-of-the-Top-Secret-Lesser-known-Parts-of-the-Story/</a>] Nick Redfern also wrote the following about another UFO incident that involved Porton Down: <span class="quote">"On the night of January 23, 1974, an enigmatic event occurred in the large Berwyn Mountain range in North Wales, United Kingdom, that, for some within the UFO research community, has come to be known as the British Roswell. Researcher Andy Roberts summed up this mysterious affair: <span class="quote">'The claim was that a UFO piloted by extraterrestrials crashed, or was shot down, on the mountain known as Cader Berwyn and that the alien crew, some still alive, were whisked off to a secret military installation in the south of England for study.'</span> That secret military installation was said to be none other than Porton Down."</span> [<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=g91EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT159>https://books.google.com/books?id=g91EDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159</a>] So I wonder if Porton Down is also home to some kind of work in psychological operations in addition to research on chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>Norman Pieniazek is another one of these guys like Yeadon who say that viruses flop as bioweapons and the pandemic was fake. But Pieniazek wrote: <span class="quote">"The best source of information is the Soviet attempt at producing biological weapons. It was a massive program under the central organization named BioPreparat. Their leading research institute was Vector, based in Akademgorodok near Novosibirsk in Siberia.

<p>In 2012 Jane Ruby was employed as medical affairs manager for the pharmaceutical company Individor whose products included a alternative to Subutex called Subuxone. She falsified data about Subuxone which led to their CEO being criminally convicted: [<a href=https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2021/alj-cr5928/index.html>https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2021/alj-cr5928/index.html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case involves a company's effort to have one of its drugs covered by the Medicaid program. To achieve this goal, a company executive deliberately submitted false information to MassHealth, the Massachusetts Medicaid agency. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, Petitioner, as the company's chief executive officer, was held criminally accountable for the offense.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>On or about October 10, 2012, RADARS gave Dr. Ruby the Massachusetts-specific analysis, but the results were not what she had expected or hoped for. They showed that, among the three categories of drugs (Suboxone Film, Suboxone Tablet, and buprenorphine-only tablets, like Subutex Tablet), the buprenorphine-only tablets had the lowest rate of unintended pediatric exposure. (1.8 exposures per 10, 000 units versus 2.7 exposures for Suboxone Film and 3.3 exposures for Suboxone Tablet). IG Ex. 2 at 7 (Information ¶ 25).[8]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby did not give Dr. Jeffrey an accurate version of the RADARS analysis. Instead, she manipulated the data by adding the two tablet rates together in order to show that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate of unintentional pediatric exposure in Massachusetts, when, in fact, it did not. On or about October 16, 2012, she emailed the false data to MassHealth, claiming, also falsely, that she had received the calculations from RADARS. She forwarded a copy of her email to Indivior's global medical director. IG Ex. 2 at 7-8 (Information ¶ 27).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby subsequently received additional data on unintended pediatric exposures; it showed that Suboxone Film <em>did not have the lowest rate</em> of unintended pediatric exposure in Massachusetts. She did not provide that data to MassHealth, telling other Indivior employees (although not Petitioner) that her rationale for withholding the additional data was <span class="quote">"don't ask, don't tell."</span> IG Ex. 2 at 9 (Information ¶ 29).[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020 it was announced that the case resulted in a 600 million USD penalty to Individor: [<a href=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525759-indivior-hit-with-600-million-in-civil-and-criminal-penalties-over/>https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525759-indivior-hit-with-600-million-in-civil-and-criminal-penalties-over/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drugmaker Indivior Solutions will pay $600 million in criminal and civil liability over its marketing of opioid-addiction treatment Suboxone, the Justice Department (DOJ) announced.</p>
<p>Indivior pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor in July for making false statements to Massachusetts's Medicaid program, MassHealth, in order to expand access to the drug for children.</p>
<p>Of the $600 million, the company was sentenced to pay $289 million in criminal penalties Wednesday, according to the DOJ.</p>

<a href=#Origins_of_the_story_that_COVID_vaccines_contain_hydrogel id=Origins_of_the_story_that_COVID_vaccines_contain_hydrogel>Origins of the story that COVID vaccines contain hydrogel</a>
</h2>
<p>When Karen Kingston first appeared in alt media, she was presented as a Pfizer whistleblower whose big revelation was that COVID vaccines contained graphene oxide and hydrogel. In 2023 Latypova also started saying that dental anesthetic contained hydrogel. So I tried searching for early tweets about the story that COVID vaccines contained hydrogel to see who mentioned it first. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel%20vaccines%20until%3A2020-7-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel%20vaccines%20until%3A2020-7-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>The earliest tweet I found was a tweet from March 2020 which said: <span class="quote">"I am more concerned about <span class="quote">'DARPA Deployment of Hydrogel'</span> vaccines. (Celeste Solum) yt"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/CYNDI12365/status/1241612603681648641>https://x.com/CYNDI12365/status/1241612603681648641</a>] The second-earliest tweet linked to a video by Celeste Solum that was mirrored on YouTube by the flat earther Jamie Lee (aplanetruth 4u). [<a href=https://x.com/Jrnyman2/status/1249020763929223170>https://x.com/Jrnyman2/status/1249020763929223170</a>, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200407191851/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqTRRm_ffog>http://web.archive.org/web/20200407191851/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqTRRm_ffog</a>] Many other early tweets also linked to YouTube videos by Celeste Solum, so she seems to have been the first person who was talking about hydrogel in connection with COVID vaccines that became popular enough that it was mentioned multiple times on Twitter. Celeste was always saying that hydrogel was a DARPA technology, in the same way Carrie Madej later also started calling it <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span>.</p>
<p>In an interview with Andrew Kaufman in May 2020, Max Igan said: <span class="quote">"Hydrogel is a - it's a nanosubstance, it's developed by DARPA - which is able to fuse with your cells, literally fuse with your cells. It goes in and it interfaces with your cells and becomes part of you. And it can be read - signals - to and from - it's like an interface into -. There's actually a report that's been put out recently by a lady called Celeste Solum. She's quite religious, I mean God bless her, she's quite religious, so the last part of the talk is - last ten minutes is quite religious. But she's a great researcher. Apparently she used to work in one of these weapons development places. And she's a bit of an insider. And she's been reporting on hydrogel. I'll send you a link after the talk, I'd be interested in you having a look at that. And uh, because of the possibility of this actually being in the vaccines, you know, this particular nano-stuff that DARPA's been working on -. And by the way, this is - they've been still working on this while the lockdown's in place. You know, when you think about it, only essential services are functioning, and the development of this hydrogel by DARPA is seen as an essential service for national security. And with the separation of the children - programming people to be separated, everyone be separated, everyone 1.5 minutes apart, 2 minutes apart over time. Forget about having children anymore. They want all the next generation of children to be - I would suggest - vaccinated with this hydrogel, and interface into the matrix, part of the AI machine, as soon as they're born, and keep them all separated from each other. So basically the response to this <span class="quote">'COVID-19'</span> is to remove every aspect of humanity from humankind, keep everybody completely separated, and make everyone - you know, fit them into this interface - into the machine, whether they want it or not. Um, I'd be really interested on you looking into that, and seeing how they may be incorporating that into the vaccines. Cause what you're saying about them modifying DNA: it fits in perfectly with what hydrogel can actually do. And there's some papers on it, some DARPA papers you can actually go look at. I'll send you some links after the talk."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Mg1GT_URHu8/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Mg1GT_URHu8/</a>, time 19:00] I believe the first four people in alt media who interviewed Kaufman were all flat earthers, and the first one of them was James True who also livestreamed Kaufman's first viral presentation, who called himself Kaufman's lead writer, and who said that he had emptied his Patreon account on producing, editing, and advertising Kafuman's videos. Kaufman now says that the earth is flat himself. In January 2020 Max Igan also did a video where he said that the earth was flat, but a few days later he said that he had some kind of a breakdown because he was being targeted with mind control technology and he doesn't actually believe in flat earth. However earlier in 2016 Max Igan did a video of his flight from Chile to Australia, where he supposedly set out to disprove the flat earth model by tracking the direction of his compass during the flight, but he ended up finding that the compass pointed to a direction that was consistent with a flat earth model, which was then used as evidence that the earth was flat by Globebusters and Jeranism (so I think Igan staged a fake video in order hoax to prop up the flat earth theory). Andrew Kaufman's <span class="quote">"Hippocratic Hypocrisy"</span> film was produced and narrated by the flat earth channel Spacebusters, but the only way in which the film featured Kaufman was that it featured clips of his interview with Max Igan.</p>
<p>In a YouTube video in May 2020, Steven Ben-Nun from Israeli News Live said: <span class="quote">"We've got a neighbor, she's been - her daughter - excuse me, her mother is already caught on what's going on. Her eyes are wide open. She realizes the danger of what's going on, the dangers of this vaccine, et cetera. The DARPA - and of course the hydrogel - the hydrogel that will actually infuse into your DNA - very, very nasty stuff. And I got to kind of hold my tongue on this, because on Israeli News Live we shouldn't be going into all these details here, have to save that for Patreon - but let me just tell you this: the neighbor shared with us - she took her son in to the doctor just recently, he has asthma so he's always having trouble with - over this asthmatic related issues there - and her doctor today warmed her to be very cautious when it comes to the vaccine, and don't take it. By the way they will put up their chip - yes, you got that right - but it's not just any kind of chip. When you're dealing with hydrogel, you're talking about infusing it into your DNA."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zomnoTTlRy0&t=6m15s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zomnoTTlRy0&amp;t=6m15s</a>] Ben-Nun used to do many videos together with Celeste Solum, so he may have heard about hydrogel from her but he lied that he heard about it from his neighbor, or maybe both Celeste and Ben-Nun were told by their handlers to start talking about hydrogel. In 2020 Ben-Nun and his friend John Moore were saying that Planet-X would pass by the earth in 2021 which would cause most humans to die, and Ben-Nun was showing screenshots of emails about Planet-X that he supposedly received from an unnamed source from NASA. John Moore says that he is a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. government, and Ben-Nun has also called himself a former CIA agent.</p>
<p>I found no tweets which mentioned Carrie Madej in connection to COVID until July 2020 when a video by her went viral. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-7-7%20carrie%20madej&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-7-7%20carrie%20madej&amp;f=live</a>] One of the topics she discussed in the video was hydrogel. She said: <span class="quote">"DARPA founded a company that produces soft flexible hydrogels - I've mentioned hydrogels in the past - injected beneath the skin to perform health monitoring. They sync to a smartphone app to give the user immediate health insights. However hydrogel nanotechnology grows and spreads in the body once implanted. We do not know how this affects our DNA. We know that it can send information directly and continuously to an artificial intelligence. Ok, so all of us have a smartphone, mine included, we have health apps. One way or another it's on your phone. Sometimes you have to look under a Google app, whatever, it's there. You can disable it but you can't erase it. It's impossible. This is a COVID-19 apps they're putting it into has to do with this. They're getting you set up. You have an app, you have a software. Now all you need is this little hydrogel that's put there. And then forever, everything in your body is monitored. For a woman, your ovulation, when you menstruate, how many times you've had sex - for a man how many times you have had sex - how much alcohol content's in your body, your vitamins and minerals, if you've fallen down, how many steps you're taking, if you're anxious, your emotions and your sleep, everything about you, continuously."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/cfE4DcT62CO6/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/cfE4DcT62CO6/</a>, time 17:38] In October 2021 I believe Carrie Madej became the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines contain hydras.</p>
<p>In September 2020 Makia Freeman wrote an article which said that COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel. [<a href=https://thefreedomarticles.com/hydrogel-biosensor-darpa-gates-implantable-nanotech-covid-vaccine/>https://thefreedomarticles.com/hydrogel-biosensor-darpa-gates-implantable-nanotech-covid-vaccine/</a>] Freeman has written many articles for David Icke's website. I believe David Icke started first saying that the coronavirus doesn't exist on April 6th 2020 UTC when he was interviewed by London Real, but 5 days before it Icke's website published an article about the no-virus theory by Makia Freeman. [<a href=https://davidicke.com/2020/04/01/deep-virus-rabbit-hole-question-everything/>https://davidicke.com/2020/04/01/deep-virus-rabbit-hole-question-everything/</a>]</p>
<p>The earliest tweet I found which said that dental anesthetic contained hydrogel was posted in February 2023 by some Qtard account, and it said: <span class="quote">"Jane Ruby and attorney Todd Callender confirm that ALL INJECTABLES contain DARPA HYDROGEL, flue shots , vxxxines and even dental anesthesia …."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&amp;f=live</a>] The first tweet I found which said that dental anesthetic contained graphene oxide was posted in August 2022, and it linked to a video by La Quinta Columna: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=dental+anesthetic+graphene+until%3A2023-3-3&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=dental+anesthetic+graphene+until%3A2023-3-3&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>In 2024 Justin Leslie came out as a whistleblower who said that Project Veritas was controlled opposition and that James O'Keefe had attended Bohemian Grove. He is supposed to have briefly worked for Pfizer as a <span class="quote">"formulation analytical scientist"</span>. He was meant to appear on Project Veritas as a Pfizer whistleblower like their earlier Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee, but O'Keefe never published his story. However he still did other work for Project Veritas, and he was the undercover operative who recorded his gay date with the mulatto Pfizer employee Jordon Walker (which was such a big hit for O'Keefe that he has now churned out around ten more videos with a similar yellow filter and a similar camera angle).</p>
<p>However Justin Leslie is probably about as genuine as other whistleblowers on Project Veritas, because he claims he gave Carrie Madej a vaccine vial which contained hydras, and he says that virology is a pseudoscience: [<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/documentary-indicates-james-okeefe-attended-bohemian-grove-suggests-hes-a-cia-asset>https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/documentary-indicates-james-okeefe-attended-bohemian-grove-suggests-hes-a-cia-asset</a>]</p>

<p>During the first semester of his master's studies, Leslie reports coming to the realization <span class="quote">"that the whole COVID narrative was absolute nonsense,"</span> that the so-called <span class="quote">"vaccines were actually death shots,"</span> and even further, in a position challenging a well-established consensus, he became convicted that virology itself <span class="quote">"was one big pseudoscience."</span></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>He further accepted his position at Pfizer in March 2021 with the specific intention of becoming a whistleblower should he come across important inside information, even having corresponded with Project Veritas (PV) at this time to offer his services.</p>
<p>After reaching out to PV again, they provided him with undercover recording equipment he began wearing to work in late September 2021. Soon after, he provided PV with a vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and gathered with other PV personnel and Dr. Carrie Madej to investigate the contents in a Mamaroneck, New York apartment on October 14, 2021.</p>
<p>Madej, an internist trained in osteopathic medicine, became well-known on the internet warning viewers to avoid the COVID injections and for examining these substances as well. On this occasion, Leslie explains how the doctor guided the microscope examination of these samples from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and the vial from Pfizer which he had provided.</p>
<p>In the J&amp;J sample the group witnessed what the young whistleblower explained as <span class="quote">"black circles and what looked like parasites revolving around them as if they had a mind of their own."</span> The Moderna and Pfizer samples <span class="quote">"had similar parasitic-like creatures in them,"</span> and while he couldn't identify what he was looking at, he said, <span class="quote">"it was absolutely nightmarish to witness."</span></p>
<p>Six days later, Madej was a guest on the Stew Peters Show where she explained these phenomena, also stating she had been working with an <span class="quote">"amazing team"</span> from PV promising that they would be <span class="quote">"giving their story very soon, which will have so much detail, so much data, so please look for that."</span></p>
<p>But instead of releasing this story that several members of this PV team witnessed themselves, Leslie states <span class="quote">"this entire story was buried by Project Veritas"</span> and it never came out, even as other researchers such as Dr. Robin Wakeling in New Zealand, and Dr. David Nixon in Australia, corroborated the findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article also mentioned that he promoted Stew ops about changes in the blood of vaccinated people seen with dark field microscopy, calamari clots, and luciferase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The documentary covers several other stories Leslie believes were of vital importance to the public which were declined for publication by Project Veritas. These include evidence of significant <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/blood-damage-explains-many-harmful-impacts-of-covid-vaccines/>changes in blood</a> following COVID <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bayer-executive-mrna-shots-are-gene-therapy-marketed-as-vaccines-to-gain-public-trust/>vaccine</a> injections, the widespread presentation of large <span class="quote">"white fibrous"</span> <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/70-of-embalmers-report-finding-strange-blood-clots-beginning-in-mid-2021/>blood clots</a> which began to appear in corpses beginning in 2021, and indications of the <span class="quote">"glowing"</span> enzyme <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bombshell-pfizer-whistleblower-says-vaccine-glows-contains-toxic-luciferase-graphene-oxide-compounds/>luciferase</a> being present in the injections, which Leslie testifies he witnessed himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During an interview with Stew Peters in October 2021, Carrie Madej said: <span class="quote">"I have worked with Project Veritas - an amazing team there - and they were able to work with a whistleblower from Pfizer, and through chain of custody they brought forward some of the vials. So I have some of my own images. But Project Veritas will, you know, be giving their story very soon which will have so much detail, so much data."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vnzy9f-shocking-dr%2e-carrie-madej-releases-first-look-at-pfizer-vial-contents.html>https://rumble.com/vnzy9f-shocking-dr%2e-carrie-madej-releases-first-look-at-pfizer-vial-contents.html</a>, time 1:32] So it matches up with Justin Leslie's story.</p>
<p>The Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee has also said that COVID vaccines contain hydrogel, nanotechnology, graphene oxide, and quantum dots:</p>

<p>The earliest reference to Melissa McAtee/Strickler I found on Twitter was from October 7th 2021 UTC after she had already come out as a whistleblower on Project Veritas, and after they had already released a slickly produced video of her interview with O'Keefe (which now has about 4 million views on YouTube).

</h2>
<p>In July 2024 the <span class="quote">"International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research"</span> published a paper by Daniel Broudy and Young Mi Lee titled <span class="quote">"Real-Time Self-Assembly of Stereomicroscopically Visible Artificial Constructions in Incubated Specimens of mRNA Products Mainly from Pfizer and Moderna: A Comprehensive Longitudinal Study"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102</a>]</p>
<p>Even though the authors used an optical microscope, they wrote that they were able to see structures that <span class="quote">"resembled carbon nanotube filaments"</span>: <span class="quote">"As time progressed during incubation, simple one- and two-dimensional structures over two or three weeks became more complex in shape and size developing into stereoscopically visible entities in three-dimensions. They resembled carbon nanotube filaments, ribbons, and tapes, some appearing as transparent, thin, flat membranes, and others as three-dimensional spirals, and beaded chains."</span> Ana Maria Mihalcea also wrote that a photo by David Nixon showed a <span class="quote">"carbon nanotube"</span> even though Nixon has said that his photos were taken with an optical microscope at 400-fold or 2000-fold magnification level. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>]</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy is an associate editor of the IJVTPR journal which published his paper, but I guess it's not a conflict of interest. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>] The associate editors of the paper also include Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, Stephanie Seneff, James Lyons-Weiler, Russel Blaylock, and Shimon Yanowitz. In September 2024 CHD posted a video where Mary Holland interviewed Ana Maria Mihalcea about who showed microscope footage of how there were blinking lights in the blood of vaccinated people. [<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970362971853192>https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1845970362971853192</a>]</p>
<p>On the page for the editorial team of IJVTPR, the bio for Shimon Yanowitz says that <span class="quote">"242 citations of his publication about image processing appear on the Web of Science"</span>. It might just be a coincidence that he has been specialized in image processing like Daniel Broudy. But actually I wouldn't be surprised if whatever agency casted Broudy and Yanowitz for their roles would've chosen them because their qualifications included image processing.</p>
<p>The introduction of the paper in IJVTPR said: <span class="quote">"The fact that such nanotechnology is in the COVID-19 injectables was first discussed, we believe, by Campra and colleagues (2021a, 2021b; Spectroscopy &amp; Campra, 2021) and was followed up by Yanowitz (2022a, 2022b, 2023a, 2023b) as documented in part by Hughes (2022) with 26 references to Campra et al. and 26 to Yanowitz's early work."</span> The references to Yanowitz were links to videos he did with Sasha Latypova, Maria Zeee, and Doctors for COVID Ethics.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the paper also mentioned Latypova: <span class="quote">"Sasha Latypova, an executive and researcher for the pharmaceutical industry, discovered an extreme deviation in side effects among the batch-to-batch vials of mRNA COVID-19 injectables."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102/291>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102/291</a>] However Latypova wrote this tweet about the paper: <span class="quote">"I saw the research published in this paper being done a year ago. I am in the same signal group with the authors. No judgement, but the paper does NOT show <span class="quote">'self-assembling nanotechnology'</span>. There is a bunch of optical microscopy (can't see nano) and no evidence of coherent technology. Nano-and micro-junk is not technology! A lot of this is just hydrogel curing and decomposing. That it makes some regular looking structures is not a proof of anything other than don't inject this crap. Now that John Campbell is promoting it, this confirms that it's a red herring, a distraction. He never speaks about real threats, at least not when they matter. His channel is heavily supported/promoted by someone behind this whole crime and he is a puppet."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1832422894799819219>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1832422894799819219</a>] I pointed out to her that she had promoted the earlier Stew Ops in the same genre by David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor, but she said that <span class="quote">"Yes, I wrote this and I stand by this, as Matt did a lot of good observational work and at least at the time was careful about making grandiose claims that <span class="quote">'nanotechnology'</span> cult members are not making."</span> However it's interesting that she said that she was in the same Signal group with the authors. When she interviewed Shimon Yanowitz in 2022, Yanowitz also said that they had a mutual friend in South Korea, which probably meant Young Mi Lee.</p>
<p>Based on Daniel Broudy's ResearchGate profile it would appear like he is an expert in propaganda rather than science: [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Broudy>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Broudy</a>]</p>

<p>Daneil Broudy's bio on the website of the Asia-Pacific Journal says that he used to work for the military but now he focuses on <span class="quote">"systems and techniques of mass manipulation in state and corporate public relations"</span>: <span class="quote">"Daniel Broudy is Professor of Rhetoric and Applied Linguistics in the Graduate School of Intercultural Communication at Okinawa Christian University.

<p>During an interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea, Broudy said that he served in the intelligence corps: <span class="quote">"And when I began doing the research for the corona story, it kinda reminded me a bit about my experiences when I was in the intelligence corps so many years ago."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html>https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html</a>, 12:12]</p>
<p>A bio of Daniel Broudy from 2014 says that he was an <span class="quote">"Army intelligence analyst in Panama during the Noriega regime"</span> (which lasted from 1983 to 1989): <span class="quote">"Daniel Broudy, former Army intelligence analyst in Panama during the Noriega regime, studied rhetoric and linguistics at Deakin University where he earned a doctorate in 2007.

<p>Daniel Broudy is based in Okinawa and he used to work for the US military, but Okinawa is basically one big American military base.

</div>
<p>It's also interesting that Broudy is a professor at a Christian college, because Christian organizations have served as a notorious front for western intelligence in East Asia. Many people in Miles Guo's movement are also Christians. In an interview with Died Suddenly, Broudy's Korean coauthor Young Mi Lee also said that she was a Christian. [<a href=https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1825892636936241392>https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1825892636936241392</a>] There have been a several cults in East Asian countries which have mixed elements of Christianity with western conspiracy culture, like the Unification Church, Miles Guo's movement, the Japanese Pana-Wave cult, and Raelianism (which became the second-most popular in Japan after France).</p>
<p>When I searched for tweets about Young Mi Lee, most of the tweets were posted either by accounts that promoted Miles Guo or accounts that posted about western conspiracy topics in East Asian languages. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=young+mi+lee+until%3A2024-8-30&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=young+mi+lee+until%3A2024-8-30&amp;f=live</a>] One of them was this account that posted in Chinese but that didn't post about Miles Guo, but its header graphic was about the Judeo-Christian Bible:</p>

</div>
<p>The first interview that Young Mi Lee and Daniel Broudy did about their paper was on a podcast by the Twitter account Died Suddenly. Died Suddenly also posted a tweet about their paper which got over 8 million views (which featured one video clip of Richard Hirschman and another video clip of a panel by Ana Maria Mihalcea, Mat Taylor, David Nixon, and Shimon Yanowitz). [<a href=https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1821862671328714830>https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1821862671328714830</a>]</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy wrote an article that was published by PANDA and he did a video presentation for PANDA. [<a href=https://pandata.org/the-serpent-and-the-staff/>https://pandata.org/the-serpent-and-the-staff/</a>, <a href=https://pandata.org/patterns-of-deception-and-deviance-post-truth/>https://pandata.org/patterns-of-deception-and-deviance-post-truth/</a>] He is the co-director and co-editor of an online publication called Propaganda in Focus along with Piers Robinson, who is also a member of PANDA. [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>] The third editor of Propaganda in Focus is Mark Crispin Miller, whose bio says that he used to teach courses on propaganda at New York University and that he has received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-4.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>The War of the Worlds broadcast was orchestrated by psychologists from New York under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. An article published by the Rockefeller Archive described that the authors later received another grant to research the public reaction to the broadcast: <span class="quote">"In his grant proposal, Cantril identified the public reaction to the War of the Worlds broadcast as <span class="quote">'an almost unparalleled source of data'</span> for those interested in understanding the impact of radio on mass movements. It would also be of use to educators troubled by what the response to the broadcast suggests about <span class="quote">'critical thinking and propaganda.'</span> It was a persuasive argument for program officers seeking to understand more clearly how propaganda works, and how to better educate Americans in media literacy."</span> [<a href=https://resource.rockarch.org/story/war-of-the-worlds-rockefeller-philanthropies-disinformation-and-media-literacy-in-the-1930s/>https://resource.rockarch.org/story/war-of-the-worlds-rockefeller-philanthropies-disinformation-and-media-literacy-in-the-1930s/</a>] So I wonder if modern-day researchers of propaganda similarly release propaganda themselves in order to study how the public audience reacts to propaganda.</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy has also coauthored two papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines with Valerie Kyrie, whose bio says that her doctoral thesis focused on the topic of reality perception and its manipulation: <span class="quote">"With a PhD in Experimental Psychology, Masters in Clinical Psychology, Kyrie is working in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management. Her doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49</a>, <a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32</a>] When her bio says that she is working in the area of psychological operations, it might have the overt meaning that she is trying to expose psychological operations conducted by other people, because for example she coauthored an article with Daniel Broudy titled <span class="quote">"The Covid-19 Concoction: A Recipe for Successful Psychological Operations"</span>. [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/the-covid-19-concoction-a-recipe-for-successful-psychological-operations/>https://propagandainfocus.com/the-covid-19-concoction-a-recipe-for-successful-psychological-operations/</a>] However I suspect that it's also intended to have the covert meaning that she is conducting psychological operations herself.</p>
<p>The senior editor of IJVTPR is Christopher A. Shaw who is also listed as an author at Propaganda in Focus. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>, <a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>]</p>
<p>As far as I can tell Lee and Broudy never wrote in their paper that they saw nanobots, but only <span class="quote">"nanobot-like structures"</span>, <span class="quote">"algae-typed magnetic nanobot-like spirals"</span>, <span class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like coils"</span>, <span class="quote">"nanoparticles"</span>, <span class="quote">"nanowires"</span>, and <span class="quote">"nanostructures"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <span class="red">magnetic nanobot-like structure</span> appeared at about 180 days incubation and disappeared later in distilled water.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Nearing the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity - after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days - specific <span class="red">algae-type magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils</span>, dark irregular spirals, appeared near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In the late stage of Moderna incubation (day 630) in distilled water, <span class="red">nanoparticles</span> reappeared floating again as previously seen during initial microscopic observations before culturing had commenced. This reappearance suggests a recycling pattern we describe later in a proposed model at Figure 27. While Moderna showed just a few filamentous structures with unique split ends and a few bundles of loose thin transparent <span class="red">nanowires</span>, Pfizer, in contrast, showed very few nanoparticles floating in close proximity to the filaments or ribbons, but in a background largely cleared of surrounding nano-debris.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Culture dishes were placed directly on a heat template set at 36.5 degrees Celsius overnight. The next morning assembled <span class="red">nanostructures</span> were observed floating over the surface of the medium in more discernible and developed shapes than before the heat (warming) exposure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During an interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea, Young Mi Lee first emphasized that the photos she showed were taken with an optical microscope so nano-scale structures were not visible. But then she showed the photos below from her paper and said: <span class="quote">"These structures are conformed as magnetic nanobot, you know. I saw same structures… exactly the same structure, at 2016 paper… I don't remember the paper name… and cited in our paper as 2019 paper. Anyway, both of papers confirmed these structures are from magnetic nanobots."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html>https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html</a>, 34:27] So because a micro-scale structure had a similar shape as a nano-scale structure, she was able to deduce that the micro-scale structure was composed of nanotechnology. Because I guess nanotechnology works like some kind of a mandelbrot set where larger structures are composed of smaller structures which have a similar shape as the larger structures:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-6.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Next she showed the slide below which featured a real image of a microalgae-based biohybrid robot, but then she compared it to the helical structure shown on the right and she said: <span class="quote">"I didn't know that what is it. But our member Lisa… You know Lisa, you remember? Yeah, Lisa noticed, Lisa from… macronanobot. So whoa! Surprise! Amazing! I found macronanobot from my incubation study with Pfizer, you know."</span> [time 36:44]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-7.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>There were zero hits on Google Search for the word <span class="quote">"macronanobot"</span>, which sounds like an oxymoron. When I asked ChatGPT what the maximum size of a nanobot was, it said that <span class="quote">"Anything significantly larger than a few micrometers would generally not be considered a <span class="quote">'nanobot'</span> but rather a microbot."</span></p>
<p>The papers from 2016 and 2019 which Lee referred to were cited in a paragraph of their paper which said: <span class="quote">"Our culture studies revealed that the Pfizer products in simple distilled water produced a variety of transparent ribbons, thin film-like membranes, coils, and spirals even without exposure to special supplements or ambient energy sources. These patterns of growth and appearance in the culture media could not be explained apart from mechanisms of action peculiar to nanotechnology (Cao, <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201901849>2019</a>; Truong et al., <a href=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/py/c6py00639f>2016</a>)."</span> I didn't find any images of spiral-like structures in either paper though.</p>
<p>The paper by Lee and Broudy said that the spiral structure was <span class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like"</span>: <span class="quote">"Nearing the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity - after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days - specific algae-type magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils, dark irregular spirals, appeared near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14)."</span> But I guess it's good enough if it's just nano-robot like even though it's on a completely different scale than nanobots.</p>
<p>Lee and Broudy also wrote that they analyzed skin samples of a patient with a variety of Morgellons disease: <span class="quote">"During the initial period of incubation, skin extracts (a variety of Morgellons) from an injected subject were placed in normal saline. The donor of the extracts was a patient suffering from the side effects of a paralytic seizure sustained just days after injection of the mRNA experimental product. Her specimens from the Moderna injectable were anonymized and coded as Extract 1 (E1). During the initial examination of the skin extract, surrounding particles appeared and seemed to exhibit a symbiotic relationship through direct observation under the stereomicroscope. After one month incubation of E1, enough seed-shaped particles, less than 1 μm in their largest dimension, sufficiently developed in size were observed floating and moving around the main portion of the skin extract in the saline solution of the culture dish."</span> In 2022 Shimon Yanowitz also told Sasha Latypova that his blood contained an entity that might have been Morgellons, and it looked very mean and it made red blood cells nervous. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/</a>, time 9:21] Lee and Broudy cited the video as a source in a paragraph of their paper which said it was a fact that COVID vaccines include nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The policy of the IJVTPR journal says: <span class="quote">"Citations of blogs, websites, government agencies, or other sources that either lack a peer-review process or that are known to publish researchers with undisclosed pecuniary biases, are not acceptable unless flagged appropriately and critiqued."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about</a>] However the paper by Lee and Broudy cited 5 Rumble videos, 2 BitChute videos, drsambailey.com, anamariamihalceamdphd.substack.com, karenkingston.substack.com, and thehighwire.com, but none of those sources were was critiqued or flagged as unreliable.</p>
<p>The People's Voice published an article about Lee and Broudy's paper titled <span class="quote">"Japan Declares State of Emergency After <span class="quote">'Nanobots'</span> Found in 96 Million Citizens"</span>. [<a href=https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/>https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/</a>] However the main text of the article didn't say anything about Japan declaring a state of emergency or nanobots being found in 96 million citizens. The article was accompanied by a video by Sean Adl-Tabatabai but it didn't say anything about Japan declaring a state of emergency or nanobots being found in 96 million people either. (Sean Adl-Tabatabai founded TPV together with his gay husband. He has previously worked for BBC and MTV, and afterwards he was the webmaster of David Icke's website, he produced some of David Icke's movies, and he started a short-lived TV channel with David Icke. But Icke also used to work for the BBC as a sportscaster.)</p>
<p>When I searched for the earliest tweets that matched the phrase <code>96 million nanobots</code>, the first three users after Sean Adl-Tabatabai who posted about the story all seemed like fake accounts: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&src=typed_query&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495>https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495</a>, <a href=https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567>https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-8.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The avatars of two of the three users look AI-generated. The account on the left portrays a black man from Ghana who posts a large number of tweets about American political topics for some reason. It had posted about 40,000 tweets by September 2024 but its oldest tweet returned by the search was from July 2024 (even though that might be if it had changed its username in July 2024, because the search doesn't return tweets that were posted under a different username). [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AJA_strategist%20until%3A2024-7-18&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3AJA_strategist%20until%3A2024-7-18&amp;f=live</a>] If you look at the left side of his avatar image, the ear and shoulder look too blurred compared to the face or to the curtain on the background (unless the blur would've been produced by some kind of a digital effect and it wasn't real blur produced by the lens of the camera). But the face in general has the kind of overal blurry appearance as AI-generated 3D images. The avatar of the white man looks even more clearly fake, and the tufts of hair on the left side of the photo are also highly blurred compared to the front of the face:</p>

</div>
<p>The display name of the other account is Steabhán Mac Giolla Riabhaigh, which would probably be the name of only a single person in the world if he was a real person. But when I googled for the name, all of the results seemed to be about either the Twitter account or about two YouTube channels which only had a couple of short videos. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/%40SteabhanMac3/videos>https://www.youtube.com/%40SteabhanMac3/videos</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE3co78i-TfHOePvlNvfrcw/videos>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE3co78i-TfHOePvlNvfrcw/videos</a>] The newest video on the other channel was a video by Stew Peters.</p>
<p>A thread about the article by The People's Voice was posted by this account that posts in Turkish and that seems to primarily post about flat earth: [<a href=https://x.com/2024T2024/status/1824279665390805141>https://x.com/2024T2024/status/1824279665390805141</a>]</p>

<p>Tweets about the paper were also posted by IlluminatiCoin, John O'Looney, nikola 3, Sudden And Unexpected, Concerned Citizen, Kim Dotcom, and Alex Jones, which are all accounts that are frequently reposted by bots that promote content about COVID from the controlled alt media:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-13.jpg width=1400>
</div>
<p>I also tried searching for tweets that matched Daniel Broudy's name from the days after he was interviewed by Died Suddenly. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=daniel%20broudy%20until%3A2024-8-22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=daniel%20broudy%20until%3A2024-8-22&amp;f=live</a>] One of the first tweets was posted by this user which portrays a Portuguese man who lives in Japan, but his avatar is clearly also fake: [<a href=https://x.com/IceSohei/status/1826283957161427284>https://x.com/IceSohei/status/1826283957161427284</a>]</p>

<p>Another tweet was posted by this account that posts in Chinese:</p>

<p>However when I scraped the most recent retweets and quote tweets by the Chinese account up to the point when the infinite scrolling stopped loading more tweets, it had reposted almost no Chinese accounts, but all of the accounts it had reposted at least 6 times posted in English except for its own account. [<a href=https://x.com/lex_is_lex%5f>https://x.com/lex_is_lex%5f</a>] They included accounts like the flat earther health guru David Wolfe whose account is probably a bot or a human-bot hybrid. [<a href=bot2.html#David_Avocado_Wolfe>bot2.html#David_Avocado_Wolfe</a>] And they also included iluminatibot, redpillb0t, and thehealthb0t, which are overtly presented as bots and which post tweets from the same pool:</p>

<p>About a month after Lee and Broudy's paper had been published, the IJVTPR journal published a commentary on the paper by Anne Ulrich, who is the chair of biochemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. She wrote the following: [<a href=https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/106/321>https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/106/321</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has long been known in the field of biophysics that all of the intriguing geometries described here by Lee and Broudy (2024) can emerge naturally from lipid preparations, as are used in the modRNA vaccinations in the form of lipid nanoparticles. They may show up especially when samples are stored over extended periods - or under inappropriate conditions. The astonishing μm-sized architectures can be explained by a simple physical process called lipid self-assembly. Notably, lipids make up the bulk of the vaccine ingredients, in other words, 2.5 mg/ml (one quarter of which is cholesterol), compared to a mere 0.1 mg/ml modRNA, in the presence of about 100 mg/ml sucrose and salts (as declared for ready-to-use Comirnaty/BNT162b2). Therefore, instead of seeking an explanation for the strange objects in terms of exotic additives, it is more plausible to start looking at the materials that are already known to be abundantly present in the injectable formulations.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In fresh modRNA preparations or samples that have been stored properly, no objects should be visible under an optical microscope, because the original nanoparticles with a diameter of around 55 nm are well below the resolution limit of 200 nm (Unruh et al., 2024). According to the manufacturer, the unopened injectable suspensions are stable for up to 10 weeks in a refrigerator. However, if they are stored for longer times or at higher temperatures, or are subjected to freeze-thawing, dilution, agitation, different salt concentrations or pH values, they can break down progressively. The delicate RNA chains are generally sensitive to hydrolysis by acids, bases, bacteria, and enzymes (for example, trace amounts of ribonuclease on the human skin), as well as to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen. Lipids can also decompose chemically in similar ways. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna injectables are in fact quite stable towards physical stressors for up to 8 days. However, the cholesterol and RNA contained therein are photosensitive and tend to get oxidized under irradiation corresponding to bright sunlight (Fongaro et al., 2023). As a result of any such degradation process, the lipids will rearrange in new ways once they have lost their cohesion due to fragmentation of the RNA chains or due to any change in the molecular composition of the sample.</p>
<p>It is commonly accepted that the physical shapes and sizes of lipid nanoparticles (especially in combination with RNA or DNA) tend to be only meta-stable. This means that the particles are kinetically trapped and have not yet reached their lowest energy state thermodynamically. As a consequence, time-dependent changes in their morphological appearance would be expected simply upon letting them stand. It is important to note that Lee and Broudy (2024) not only incubated their material for extended periods of up to 12 months; but, in fact, they diluted some samples with distilled water or blood plasma. To other samples they added oxidants like H2O2 or ClO2, or they mixed them with some electrolyte solutions, or various colloidal/mineral suspensions. Any changes in the aqueous environment, as well the addition of low molecular weight compounds, proteins or colloids, can dramatically affect the stability of nanoparticles. Under the diverse experimental conditions that were used, a regrouping of the lipids into other types of structures is not at all surprising.</p>
<p>A lipid mixture can often take on several different phase states and/or structural shapes, as is conveniently displayed in a phase-diagram, usually as a function of temperature and water content. But other parameters, too, have an influence of the phase behaviour of lipid systems, such as the component ratios, salt, pH, additives, pressure, etc., many of which will have been affected under the different experimental conditions. It is obvious that some molecular phase separation or de-mixing has taken place in some of the incubated vaccine samples, allowing the poorly water-soluble cholesterol to crystallize out. This interpretation can fully explain the appearance of the sharp-edged platelets and angular chips (top left corner of Figure 1), which have already been attributed to cholesterol crystals (or even simple salt) in earlier discussions cited by Lee and Broudy (2024).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The McCullough Foundation caught a lot of flak after they tweeted a link to Lee and Broudy's paper, but they later deleted the tweet and posted a link to the rebuttal by Anne Ulrich instead. [<a href=https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1834316750764069339>https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1834316750764069339</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 IJVTPR published a paper by David Hughes titled <span class="quote">"What Is in the So-called COVID-19 <span class="quote">'Vaccines'</span>? Part 1: Evidence of a Global Crime Against Humanity"</span>. It featured images of microchips by the Fifth Column and images of hydras by Carrie Madej: [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-17.jpg width=1400>
</div>
<p>However David Hughes is also a writer at Propaganda in Focus, where his bio says that he lectures in security studies and his areas of research include <span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span class="quote">"the class relations between psychological operations"</span>: [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-18.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>So IJVTPR has published papers about nanotechnology in COVID shots by at least 3 different people who are all specialized in researching propaganda or psychological operations, who are Daniel Broudy, Valerie Kyrie, and David Hughes. The team of three propagandists has also written articles that were published by Solari Report and Unlimited Hangout: [<a href=https://researchmap.jp/d_broudy?lang=en>https://researchmap.jp/d_broudy?lang=en</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-19.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The article published in Solari Report said that <span class="quote">"we have prepared a video summary of our article, which was presented as part of the Doctors for Covid Ethics Fifth Symposium in December 2022"</span>: [<a href=https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/>https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-20.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Doctors for COVID Ethics is kind of a shady organization, and earlier on this page I pointed out how Latypova and Yeadon have also been speakers in their symposiums, and in 2022 they published a long article by Latypova before she had her own Substack. The paper by Lee and Broudy cited four different videos by Shimon Yanowitz, but one of them was a presentation he did for Doctors for COVID Ethics:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-21.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Not surprisingly David Hughes claims that the pandemic was fake, because he wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19 pandemic'</span> was a Big Lie: there is no credible epidemiological evidence to support its existence. Rather, the <span class="quote">'pandemic'</span> was a media-driven social phenomenon that served to deflect attention from far-reaching technocratic agendas being advanced across every area of life."</span> [<a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-41850-1_6>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-41850-1_6</a>] He also wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19 pandemic'</span> was, in the view of Kyrie and Broudy (2022a), conjured out of <span class="quote">'mass hysteria, malpractice, censorship and juggled data.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>Added in December 2024: Youngmi Lee has now updated her Orcid profile. [<a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1210-4726>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1210-4726</a>] VaccineMole wrote: <span class="quote">"Her academic journey in Obstetrics and Gynecology began in the '80s and '90s. Later, in 1997, she expanded her education by traveling to the U.S. as a visiting doctor at both the Evanston Continence Center in Evanston, IL, where she practiced for three months, and at the University of Illinois at Chicago. There, she engaged as a researcher in Reproductive Endocrinology and worked in a Molecular Biology lab for one year, enhancing her expertise in the field. Although most of her research publications are in Korean Scientific Journals and are difficult to access, one notable study was conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1998."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/VaccineMole/status/1868730154425434257>https://x.com/VaccineMole/status/1868730154425434257</a>] It's often a red flag when someone in alt media has ties to a foreign country or they have lived in a foreign country, like how Reiner Fullmich and Sucharit Bhakdi have also both lived in the United States but they now seem to be responsible for importing US-produced disinformation to Europe. Limeng Yan also got married to her husband in New York in 2014 because her husband's family already lived in the US at the time. [<a href=https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/home0009/research/li-meng-yan>https://sites.google.com/housatonicits.com/home0009/research/li-meng-yan</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>One way to gauge whether someone in alternative media is genuine or not is to look at which channels they did their alt media on, but if it's the Stew Peters Show like in the case of Sasha Latypova and David Nixon, then they're probably not legitimate.</p>
<p>Another sign that someone is not legitimate is if they don't publish much of their own research in textual form but they're more focused on doing video or audio interviews. For example Sasha Latypova had a Telegram channel before she appeared on Stew Peters, but I don't know about any presence that Karen Kingston or Richard Hirschman had in the COVID conspiratard movement before they started doing video interviews.</p>
<p>I tried to compile a table of the earliest video or audio interviews that various people mentioned in this HTML file did in alt media. The table might be missing a few early interviews for some people. The dates are generally in UTC but some dates might be a day off from UTC dates. Some dates are the date when a tweet about a video was posted on Twitter which might be one or a few days off from the date of the video. Out of the people in this table, J.J. Couey and David Martin started posting videos on their own YouTube channel before their earliest interview listed here.</p>

</h2>
<p>Stew Peters posted this tweet in April 2024: <span class="quote">"The <span class="citation" data-cites="DiedSuddenly_">@DiedSuddenly_</span> account has been hijacked by <span class="citation" data-cites="LaurenWitzkeDE">@LaurenWitzkeDE</span> et al and is currently not being run by the Stew Peters Network."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915</a>] Around the same time he filed a lawsuit against Lauren Witzke's production company TLM Global, which he had hired to produce his show and films. [<a href=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/>https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/</a>]</p>
<p>An article about the lawsuit said the following: [<a href=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire>https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial complaint, which notes that Fokiss is doing business as the Stew Peters Network, accuses the TLM team of making <span class="quote">"unauthorized donation solicitations"</span> on a website associated with <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly."</span> Fokiss' complaint also alleged all of the defendants made <span class="quote">"improper"</span> applications for trademarks associated with the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> brand. The court filing also includes a copy of a termination letter that Peters apparently sent to Szall on January 27, 2024 in an attempt to end their business relationship. That letter describes the <span class="quote">"ownership confusion of the <span class="quote">'DIED SUDDENLY'</span> name, twitter page, and documentary"</span> along with <span class="quote">"unapproved postings, fundraisers, and even subscription sign ups"</span> that Peters called <span class="quote">"unacceptable"</span> and even <span class="quote">"criminal."</span></p>
<p>Despite these concerns Peters indicated in the letter a willingness to continue to work with Szall, Witzke, and TLM. Peters specified that Crosstalk <span class="quote">"may continue to air on the SPN."</span> He also discussed the terms for this, which he indicated were part of a separate <span class="quote">"contract."</span> The deal outlined by Peters in the letter indicated that <span class="quote">"Crosstalk"</span> was fully produced by TLM and then delivered to his company on the afternoon it was aired. He wrote that TLM needed to pay $1,600 monthly to air on the network. The exchange indicates that, at least in this case, Peters charged other hosts to make content for his network, which offered them the benefit of exposure to his following. Peters also wrote that TLM had an <span class="quote">"ongoing obligation to complete and deliver … the remaining two documentaries"</span> for which he said they were already <span class="quote">"paid in full for by the Stew Peters Network."</span></p>
<p>The complaint details the amount TLM was paid to make documentaries for Peters. It also identified Goldco, a relatively mainstream company that helps clients invest in gold and other precious metals as the primary funder of the Stew Peters Network and its documentaries.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Goldco had two sponsorship agreements with Peters' company that ran from April 2022 to the end of last month. He has continued to identify the company as a sponsor in more recent broadcasts as well. The complaint described Goldco as providing <span class="quote">"the majority of the Network's annual budgets and production requirements."</span> Goldco and its CEO, Trevor Gerszt, did not respond to questions from TPM about its role financing Peters' network, and its extremist content.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Peters' company provided TLM a <span class="quote">"documentary budget"</span> of $379,000 through two separate payments last year that were <span class="quote">"generally tied to the Plaintiff's obligations to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2024 on the Fresh and Fit podcast, one of the hosts asked Stew Peters: <span class="quote">"Didn't you say in a lawsuit that you were almost completely funded by a Jewish gold company Goldco?"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4x7str-stew-peters-meets-fresh-and-fit.html>https://rumble.com/v4x7str-stew-peters-meets-fresh-and-fit.html</a>, time 48:24] Then Stew answered: <span class="quote">"Could I say that I'm funded by a Jewish gold company? Yeah, I am. I mean, Goldco is a great company. They sponsored the film. So in essence I guess you could say that I'm funded by these people. These people give me the funds to go create material and content that I produce to the public for free. So, yeah, I mean, I guess you could say that. The guy that owns Goldco, uh, says that he's a Jew, so."</span> [clip at <a href=https://x.com/_RantCast/status/1832767843655684448>https://x.com/_RantCast/status/1832767843655684448</a>]</p>
<p>During the same podcast Stew Peters also said that Lauren Witzke had a fake white nationalist persona: <span class="quote">"She's like this, um, fake Christian white nationalist gal that has like this online presence of being like, um, you know, Ms. Nick Fuentes kind of sort of. You know, take all of his view points, carbon copy them, put them into her - her online presence, that's her persona. Ok, but she's now like pregnant with a Mexican who I think is gay, a brown baby, and she's like, <span class="quote">'Yeah, whatev'</span>."</span> [time 54:25; clip at <a href=https://x.com/RightWingWatch/status/1795475776663363958>https://x.com/RightWingWatch/status/1795475776663363958</a>]</p>
<p>In the initial claim filed by Stew Peters basically stated that Goldco owned his ass: [<a href=https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982.1.0.pdf>https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982.1.0.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>43. On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a sponsorship agreement with GoldCo (the <span class="quote">"GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement"</span>), a company that provides services in the precious metals industry.</p>
<p>44. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, GoldCo and Plaintiff worked out an annual budget for GoldCo's sponsorship of the Network.</p>
<p>45. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, Plaintiff had certain requirements it had to meet such as mentioning GoldCo as a sponsor throughout its Network and also producing and releasing a certain amount of documentaries during each GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement contractual term.</p>
<p>46. The initial GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement term commenced on April 28, 2022 and ended on April 28, 2023 (the <span class="quote">"Initial Term"</span>).</p>
<p>47. Since the Initial Term, Plaintiff and GoldCo have renewed the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement for a second term (the <span class="quote">"Second Term"</span>), which commenced on April 28, 2023 and is set to expire on April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>48. While GoldCo is not a party to this action, the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement is a vital piece to the relationship, duties, and responsibilities of the parties hereto because the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, and the requirements therein, provided the majority of the Network's annual budgets and production requirements.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>53 . Both Plaintiff and TLMG understood that their Agreement regarding Network Production and Documentary Production and the obligations therein were generally tied to the Plaintiff's obligations to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement because GoldCo provided the majority of the budget for the production of the Network and also because the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement had strict requirements regarding the number of documentaries that would be released by Plaintiff in each contract term.</p>

<p>In 2023 when Stew Peters was attacked by Media Matters because of his antisemititism, Lauren Witzke posted a tweet which said <span class="quote">"Support Stew from this slanderous attack and buy gold here: goldco.com/stew"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709576077771706637>https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709576077771706637</a>] She also posted a tweet which said <span class="quote">"Media Matters will be hearing from our very vicious and money hungry Jewish lawyer!"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709579540710797680>https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709579540710797680</a>]</p>
<p>An interview of Goldco's founder said: <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'As a young boy in South Africa, I would get silver dollars on birthdays and Jewish holidays,'</span> he says. <span class="quote">'I would look at these older coins and was amazed. I would savor them and collect them.'</span>"</span> [<a href=https://calbizjournal.com/gold-standard/>https://calbizjournal.com/gold-standard/</a>] Lust for gold and silver seems to be hardwired in the blood of these people.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby's interview with Young Mi Lee included a long advertisement for a company called Augusta Gold &amp; Silver, which was also listed as the first sponsor in the description of the video.
