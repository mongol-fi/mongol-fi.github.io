</h2>
<p>Around November 2022, J.J. Couey started to say that RNA viruses cannot cause pandemics, that COVID was caused by localized releases of infectious cDNA clones, and that the laboratory origin of the virus is a distraction and that gain-of-function research is not very dangerous. And Couey also started doing streams of videos by no-virus people like Andrew Kaufman, and he started saying that the no-virus people are right in a lot of ways but that he wanted to create a more nuanced version of their theory. Around the same time in late 2022, Mike Yeadon, Sasha Latypova, and Karen Kingston all started to promote a similar story that COVID was not caused by a virus, that viruses are not capable of causing pandemics, and that gain-of-function research is not actually that dangerous. Latypova said that COVID may have been caused by a release of aerosolized nanoparticles or by some kind of a release of toxins. And Kingston said that COVID was caused by an aerosol attack of bat vaccines that only contained the spike protein but not the full virus.</p>
<p>In a Substack post in February 2023, Latypova wrote the following: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230304144011/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/deliberate-deployment-of-bio-chemical>http://web.archive.org/web/20230304144011/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/deliberate-deployment-of-bio-chemical</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lab Leak is baloney. I hope you can see it now as it is being unveiled in the most unsubtle way right on cue before WHO pandemic treaty is being put in place.</p>
<p>They are trotting this earthshattering breaking story now, finally telling you the <span class="quote">"truth"</span> (yeah, we lied a little bit about pangolins and bats, but it was for your own good, silly peasants!) because WHO treaty is happening now, and they need everyone to fall in line supporting the global totalitarian biosecurity state, where the unelected overlords will <span class="quote">"protect you"</span> from <span class="quote">"lab leaks from enemies and rogue scientists"</span>, by putting you in 15-minute prisons, I mean smart cities, and murdering you with protective military prototype <span class="quote">"vaccines"</span>.</p>
<p>If you still think lab leaks are a thing - please explain how they can happen, when nobody can produce animal to animal infection by <span class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> in the lab? But it can leak and infect the whole world outside the lab! Far from the lab and skipping areas in between! Just not inside it.</p>
<p>Please don't fall for this narrative. There are no lab leaks. There is deliberate deployment of bio-chemical warfare agents, toxins of various kinds, including nano-scale particles by which materials that are not terribly harmful can become much more so. This deployment can be done via aerosols, formulations in food, transdermal, etc. These are deployed by the military enforcement arm of the global banking cartel, and they do not hold allegiance to any people or nations.</p>

<p>In another Substack post in December 2022, Latypova wrote: [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/the-mouse-king>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/the-mouse-king</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this brilliant <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1660073740>presentation</a>, JJ Couey explains why, and what Sars Cov 2 biowarfare agent actually is - a purified viral clone that is marginally dangerous for a short period of time and does not spread by itself.</p>
<p>If you hear <span class="quote">"every PhD student can make a deadly pathogen in a home lab"</span> - please do not fall for this 3-letter agencies-inspired nonsense. While the techniques maybe available, these <span class="quote">"engineered viruses"</span> are duds that cannot and do not spread as they get rapidly attenuated by interaction with all living nature. To make something remotely dangerous one needs to make and purify A LOT of biological material, which is very expensive and requires substantial manufacturing facilities. PhD students do not have these kind of resources. You know who does? The Government-Military-Academia-Pharmaceutical complex that appropriates and spends billions to <span class="quote">"keep you safe"</span> from <span class="quote">"rogue PhD students"</span>. However, the government-academia-pharma cartel cannot make anything that lives and spreads by itself. They have to apply their biowarfare materials in some other ways, such as aerosols, gels and other formulations and even then it is only dangerous to small numbers of people and for a short period of time. Here's Peter Daszak's <a href=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966-defuse-proposal>DEFUSE</a> proposal to DARPA explaining how he was going to make these <span class="quote">"novel automated aerosolization systems"</span>, <span class="quote">"transdermal nanoparticles applications"</span>, and <span class="quote">"edible adhesive gels"</span> and test them on bat colonies in caves (which are probably a good model for a crowded city during the commuter hour).</p>
<p>Pandemics do not exist in nature. Epidemics, if they do occur are local and self-extinguishing, because that's how nature works. The evil psychopaths cannot really make pandemics happen. They can only scare you into believing these are possible in order to gain control over you and establish their cherished dream - a global totalitarian biosecurity state. Be Not Afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an audio interview in February 2023, Latypova said that COVID was not caused by a virus: <span class="quote">"I agree with the fact that this wasn't a virus - wasn't a respiratory virus - wasn't a pandemic. Pandemics don't exist. Nothing can spread around the world, nothing like by itself. It needs a lot of help. So what they have done is they have applied in certain areas, but in combination with propaganda, they applied some sort of toxins, they probably weren't just chemicals. You know, that would be my first guess."</span> [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/tnt-radio-discussion-with-jesse-zurawell>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/tnt-radio-discussion-with-jesse-zurawell</a>, time 51:44]</p>
<p>In a video interview in August 2022, Mike Yeadon said the following: [<a href=https://genkimanquest.substack.com/p/dr-mike-yeadon-on-respiratory-viruses>https://genkimanquest.substack.com/p/dr-mike-yeadon-on-respiratory-viruses</a>, <a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/dMFGHuOuucsI/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/dMFGHuOuucsI/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be - I'll call them the perpetrators, the people running this global crime, it's a global crime to take over all of humanity - what they've done is they've pretended that there was a serious new respiratory viral health threat, this virus in Wuhan.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there never was an exaggerated - there never was any new health threat whatsoever. Partly the beauty of this is, it can't go wrong, there are no moving parts. There's literally, the only moving part is the PCR test. The initial thing, an exaggerated health threat.</p>
<p>Now, some people believe there's a new virus. But if so, it is not any more serious than influenza, not really, because flu vanished at the same time by sheer coincidence.</p>
<p>Personally, I have come to the conclusion, and I will credit Andrew Cowan [sic; he combined the names of Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan] and his colleagues, I had a really good chat with those guys early in 2020, and it bothered me, bothered me, bothered me. I realized over time I could no longer maintain my understanding of respiratory viruses as I thought I knew them.</p>
<p>And then I learned a new bit of information recently and it was just, it collapsed the possibility that respiratory viruses as described exist at all. They don't.</p>
<p>People do get ill, people are ill, and people have exactly the same illnesses - Peter, and your listeners - exactly the same illnesses as before that horrible Yeadon said viruses don't exist. They still have quote <span class="quote">"colds"</span>, they still have quote <span class="quote">"flu"</span>. I think we don't know what causes them and they're not respiratory viruses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2022, Karen Kingston wrote that Stew Peters asked her to explain what happened in Wuhan, and then because of that she issued a statement on the Stew Peters Show where she said the following: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20221216072116/https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/what-happened-in-wuhan-75-billion>http://web.archive.org/web/20221216072116/https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/what-happened-in-wuhan-75-billion</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Residents of Wuhan and other cities of China, Italy and the United States, were victims of a coordinated nanoparticle bioweapon attack, a bioweapon attack using the same nanoparticles that are in all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Most victims became infected with the nanoparticles via a direct aerosol attack, surface transmission, or food and beverage contamination.</p>
<p>US citizens should be horrified to learn that EcoHealth Alliance, the NIH, the DOD, and other departments within our US government refer to lipid nanoparticles (nanocarriers) as vaccine technology that can a deliver toxin, chemical weapon, and/or weapon of biowarfare.</p>
<p>The EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA clearly identifies nanoparticle bioweapons as spike proteins, spike protein nanoparticles that are <span class="quote">"bat vaccines."</span> EcoHealth lays out the plan to"'vaccinate" residents of select Chinese cities as well as US residents with spike-protein nanoparticle bat-vaccines via aerosol attack, surface transmission, and food and beverage contamination. The purposes of the nanoparticle bat-vaccines are to suppress the human immune system while turning human beings into carriers of lethal diseases.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>COVID-19 is caused by an advanced nanoparticle bioweapon that uses mRNA technology to strategically deteriorate and destroy cardiovascular, neurological, immune and reproductive systems. COVID-19 is NOT caused by a virus, gain-of-function or wild-type.</p>
<p>Lastly, the victims who were originally inoculated with the bioweapon in 2020 were not highly-contagious, if infectious at all. The first round of nanoparticle bioweapons did not contain mRNA codes. They were <span class="quote">"empty rounds."</span> There were also over 200 mRNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020. The virus was never isolated because multiple mRNA sequences were released.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It's important to understand that <span class="quote">"gain-of function viruses"</span> are simply mRNA codes. mRNA is not a biosynthetic substance itself, mRNA is a software code. SARS-CoV-2 is not a virus, it's a software code programmed into nanoparticles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how in the article above Kingston even wrote that SARS-CoV-2 is not a virus. Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"The bioweapons developed by EcoHealth, US and CCP are far worse than <span class="quote">'GOF viruses'</span>. Military nanoparticle bioweapons <span class="quote">'spike proteins'</span> were intentionally released on global citizens (not a virus).Every human being has the right to know this info."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1606065203367407616>https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1606065203367407616</a>] Kingston also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Why did the CIA put out the Chinese lab leak as a cover story for COVID-19? Because COVID-19 is not caused by a mRNA gain-of-function SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 is caused by the lipid nanoparticle technology, an Ai bioweapon."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1613576186596294656>https://x.com/Kingston_Truth/status/1613576186596294656</a>]</p>
<p>Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, Jane Ruby, and Stew Peters all use the word <span class="quote">"bioweapon"</span> to refer to COVID vaccines. When I searched for old tweets by Stew Peters which contained the word virus, it seemed like in the first half of 2021 he was speaking of the virus as if it actually exists, but in the second half of 2021 he started putting scare quotes around the word virus, and in August 2021 he linked to an article about Christine Massey's FOIA requests where he wrote: <span class="quote">"The whole COVID <span class="quote">'Virus'</span> thing just crumbled. Completely."</span> And then in December 2021 after he interviewed Karen Kingston, Stew Peters posted a large number of tweets like this where he promoted Karen Kingston's theory: [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1604153555656622081>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1604153555656622081</a>]</p>

<p>Fans of our Pfizer crew seem to be convinced that the lab leak narrative is a distraction and that COVID was caused by a nanoparticle attack:</p>

<p>Added later: Before Latypova appeared on Stew Peters in January 2022, she was already saying that the virus hasn't been isolated on Telegram: [<a href=https://t.me/COVID1984chat/252193>https://t.me/COVID1984chat/252193</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-telegram.png width=500>

<p>During a Twitter space in 2024, Latypova said that she and her husband got sick at the same time and she lost her sense of smell and taste, but she didn't need to take a COVID test because she knew it was fake: <span class="quote">"Myself and my husband got simultaneously sick. I never took any COVID test - cause, I just, you know, I knew it was fake - but the symptomology was very very characteristic, the loss of taste and smell."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/SeanBFlanagan/status/1797332010446311485>https://x.com/SeanBFlanagan/status/1797332010446311485</a>, time 53:55]</p>

<p>Added in 2025: Yeadon has now gone full no-virus, and he says that HIV does not exist: [<a href=https://x.com/MikeYeadon3828/status/1907693102145364047>https://x.com/MikeYeadon3828/status/1907693102145364047</a>]</p>

<p>Latypova was a co-founder of iCardiac Technologies which did a multimillion-dollar deal with Pfizer in 2007: [<a href=https://rbj.net/2007/01/29/icardiac-technologies-signs-deal-with-pfizer/>https://rbj.net/2007/01/29/icardiac-technologies-signs-deal-with-pfizer/</a>]</p>

<p>Prior to iCardiac Technologies, Ms. Latypova headed sales and business development at VirtualScopics, Inc., a technology spin out from the University of Rochester, which achieved peak market capitalization of over $200 million (NASDAQ: VSCP). During her tenure at VirtualScopics, she expanded the client portfolio from one lead customer, Pfizer, to 6 of the top-10 pharmaceutical companies as well as multiple smaller pharmaceutical and medical device clients.</p>

<p>Karen Kingston has said that she used to be a <span class="quote">"top-performing cardiovascular specialty representative with Pfizer"</span> and that afterwards Pfizer was one of the clients of her consulting firm called Varitage. [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-perception-reality>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/is-perception-reality</a>] Her LinkedIn says that from 1996 to 1998, she was a <span class="quote">"Labs/Cardiovascular Healthcare Representative"</span> at Pfizer where she <span class="quote">"took Manhattan territory from near last in the North East Region to #1"</span> and she was <span class="quote">"promoted to Cardiovascular Healthcare Representative for the east side of Manhattan"</span>, and that from 1998 to 2000 she worked as an account supervisor for CDM New York in Manhattan, which was <span class="quote">"integral in the relaunch of Viagra by shifting focus of the campaign to younger men and establishing the clinical relevance of sexual health to overall wellness"</span>. [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenkingstonkk/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenkingstonkk/</a>] Her LinkedIn profile also says that she has been the president and founder of Varitage from 2007 until present, with the following description: <span class="quote">"Services range from strategic business planning and clinical communications to the development of broad-reaching digital marketing plans and e-commerce platforms. Clients include industry leaders, such as Pfizer and Medtronic, to start-ups and leading venture capital firms, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corporation."</span></p>

<p>On a subreddit of the United States Army, there was a question about what work in psyops really involves, where someone answered that they were specialized in psychological operations and that it was <span class="quote">"very similar to public relations and marketing with different audiences"</span>. [<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rwyrfb/what_is_psyops_really/>https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rwyrfb/what_is_psyops_really/</a>] And another user also answered: <span class="quote">"Did Psyop for 6years now do Marketing. It's very similar just different target audience and you're not selling Tide detergent."</span> Karen Kingston seems to have followed the opposite career trajectory.</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon is sometimes erroneously described as the former vice president of Pfizer, but he was only the vice president and chief scientific officer of Pfizer's division for allergy and respiratory research. An article from 2012 said: <span class="quote">"Ziarco's CEO Dr Mike Yeadon was chief scientific officer, allergy and respiratory research, during his time at Pfizer, before the US pharma firm announced last year it would leave the facility."</span> [<a href=https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/pfizer_helps_fund_biotech_venture_from_former_researchers_at_closed_kent_facility_446225>https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/pfizer_helps_fund_biotech_venture_from_former_researchers_at_closed_kent_facility_446225</a>] In an interview of Yeadon in 2013, he was described as the former <span class="quote">"head of allergy and respiratory biology"</span> of Pfizer. [<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3936>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3936</a>] An article by Yeadon from 2020 said: <span class="quote">"Dr Mike Yeadon is the former CSO and VP, Allergy and Respiratory Research Head with Pfizer Global R&amp;D and co-Founder of Ziarco Pharma Ltd."</span> [<a href=https://dailysceptic.org/2020/09/20/lies-damned-lies-and-health-statistics-the-deadly-danger-of-false-positives/>https://dailysceptic.org/2020/09/20/lies-damned-lies-and-health-statistics-the-deadly-danger-of-false-positives/</a>]</p>
<p>An article about Mike Yeadon's company Ziarco said: [<a href=https://drug-dev.com/ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-secures-financing/>https://drug-dev.com/ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-secures-financing/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ziarco recently announced the closing of an initial $6-million tranche of Series A financing totalling $27 million. The round was led by Biotechnology Value Fund L.P, with participation by Pfizer Venture Investments.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the financing, Ziarco has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize a portfolio of clinical, preclinical, and research anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic assets. In return, Pfizer will receive equity as well as certain product-based milestone and royalty payments. Ziarco will use the proceeds of the financing to continue development of these assets and advance proprietary research.</p>

<p>Many of the stories that Latypova has covered are also somehow related to Pfizer, as you can see from these descriptions of her BitChute videos:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>It would make sense for Pfizer to insert a bunch of people in alt media to first say that Pfizer vaccines contain hydras, and next that Pfizer vaccines contain snake venom, and then that Pfizer vaccines contain self-assembling robot arms. It makes anti-vaxxers look ridiculous, and it causes genuine criticism of the vaccines to get buried within a sea of false information.</p>

<p>I believe Latypova did her alt media debut on January 7th 2022 UTC on the Stew Peters Show, or at least I didn't find tweets about any earlier appearances she did in alt media: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-3-1+%28sasha+OR+alexandra%29+latypova&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-3-1+%28sasha+OR+alexandra%29+latypova&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The Rumble video for Stew's interview with Latypova was titled <span class="quote">"LIVE: Hackers Reveal DEADLY Jab Lot Numbers, HORRIFIC Pfizer Teen Trial Data and MORE!"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data%2d.html>https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data%2d.html</a>] The description of the video said: <span class="quote">"Recently on this show Dr. Jane Ruby came on and gave us the remarkable information that a huge percentage of side effects tracked in the CDC's VAERS database are linked to just a small percentage of the vaccine batches produced by Pfizer and Moderna. This data came from a group calling itself Team Enigma. They're a group of independent researchers with experience in medical R&amp;D, statistics, data analytics, and everything else you'd need to investigate a vaccine's impact on millions of people. A lot of Team Enigma is anonymous but thankfully one of their number has agreed to speak publicly. Sasha Latypova joins us to discuss."</span></p>
<p>Team Enigma's analysis was based on publicly available data from VAERS, but Stew Peters and Jane Ruby misrepresented it as data that came from hackers. The video for Latypova's first appearance on Stew Peters was titled <span class="quote">"LIVE: Hackers Reveal DEADLY Jab Lot Numbers, HORRIFIC Pfizer Teen Trial Data and MORE!"</span> Stew introduced Latypova as <span class="quote">"one of the analysts that took this data from the hackers"</span>, but Latypova wasn't on the show yet at that point so she couldn't correct him, and Latypova didn't claim herself that the data came from hackers. [<a href=https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data-.html?start=1155>https://rumble.com/vs59wj-live-hackers-reveal-deadly-jab-lot-numbers-horrific-pfizer-teen-trial-data-.html?start=1155</a>] A few days before Latypova went on Stew's show, Jane Ruby talked about Team Enigma on Stew's show. She said this about them: <span class="quote">"They told me that they were informed by professional hackers that - this is big news, nobody else has broken this - that these professional hackers got into Pfizer and Moderna systems, and they were able to verify the lots. Craig Paardekooper has a list of all of the Moderna batches deployed so far. And Moderna also has a web tool - this will probably disappear after the Stew Peters Show airs - it has a web tool for checking the expiration dates of batches - and these computer guys hacked Moderna's website and got the entire list of Moderna batches, the full list of batch codes, and they did the same for Pfizer."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vrvjfu-breaking-deadly-vax-lot-numbers-identified-still-in-circulation.html?start=585>https://rumble.com/vrvjfu-breaking-deadly-vax-lot-numbers-identified-still-in-circulation.html?start=585</a>] At the end of the segment Stew said: <span class="quote">"This is gonna go away though. This search function is gonna go away. And thanks to these hackers as well, and for your time investigating, being inside of that, thank you so much Dr. Jane Ruby."</span> A few days before Latypova went on Stew's show, a website called <span class="quote">"Before It's News"</span> also published an article that said: <span class="quote">"Hackers broke into all the pharmaceutical companies and stold all the medial data on vaccines thank God!!!!

<p>On January 8th 2022 UTC which was a day later than Latypova appeared on Stew Peters, the Odysee channel of Füllmich's Corona Investigative Committee published a video where Mike Yeadon did a presentation of Team Enigma's vaccine lot variability data. One of his slides said that the slides were prepared by Team Enigma and the filename of the slides was <span class="quote">"VAERS by LOT-Dec13-video ver Latypova -1.pptx"</span>: [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en>https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en</a>]</p>

<p>Latypova said on Twitter: <span class="quote">"I gave Mike Yeadon these slides when he was going on Reiner Fullmich's Corona Committee, bc he asked me. During the video he said <span class="quote">'my colleague'</span> and <span class="quote">'she'</span> - that's referring to me. At the time I was practically unknown."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1877585275326705931>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1877585275326705931</a>]</p>
<p>A transcript of Yeadon's presentation was published by UK Column. [<a href=https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies>https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies</a>] In June 2022, Latypova and Yeadon were both speakers in a symposium by Doctors for COVID Ethics which was hosted by UK Column.

<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-yeadon-pdf.jpg width=1000>

<p>Doctors for COVID Ethics also published a Spanish translation of Latypova's article. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.es%5f.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sasha-revised2.es%5f.pdf</a>] Doctors for COVID Ethics is an organization of Sucharit Bhakdi. Bhakdi and Füllmich are both based in Germany but they have previously lived in the U.S.</p>

<a href=#International_connections_and_Miles_Guos_bots id=International_connections_and_Miles_Guos_bots>International connections and Miles Guo's bots</a>
</h2>
<p>After Latypova's appeared on the Stew Peters Show in January 2022, her second-oldest interview I found was done by a Dutch channel called <span class="quote">"Medisch weekjournaal"</span> and her third-oldest interview I found was done by J.J. Couey who used to work at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam (which George Webb says is home to one of NATO's main bioweapon labs). And it might be a coincidence, but the main guy in Team Enigma was Craig Paardekooper, who lives in the UK but who is of Dutch ancestry.</p>
<p>Content by people who appear on the Stew Peters Network is often translated to several non-English languages, just like QAnon content and content by Miles Guo's network. The story about graphene oxide originally came from a Spanish group called La Quinta Columna, but they also have an Odysee channel where they post content from the Stew Peters Network with subtitles in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish: [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational?view=content>https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational?view=content</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-quinta-odysee.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's Twitter bots also post video clips from English-language alt media with subtitles in various languages, and often even bots that primarily post in Chinese randomly post videos with subtitles in European languages. Often the same bots also post tweets in several different languages, like how the account shown below posted tweets in Chinese, German, French, and Spanish. For example the bot below posted a clip of an interview of Latypova with Chinese subtitles, but the bot has also tweeted in languages like German, Spanish, and French: [<a href=https://x.com/369Jessica369/status/1579301325996969985>https://x.com/369Jessica369/status/1579301325996969985</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guobot.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>(Or actually I don't know if some of the accounts are hybrids between manually-ran accounts and bots, or they might be bots which pick some of their tweets from a pool of human-written templates, or they might be manually-ran accounts which post some automated tweets, but I'll refer to them as bots for the sake of convenience.)</p>
<p>One of the Guo bots also promoted J.J. Couey's story that people who say that the virus is a bioweapon are trying to trick you into being afraid of the virus. The same bot posted photos from the first anniversary of the New Federal State of China, which was held at the One World Trade Center in New York City, and which featured Limeng Yan as one of the speakers along with the former DIA head Mike Flynn and the naval intelligence officers Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-jc-guobot.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's bots often have English names, like how the bots in the screenshots above are named 369Jessica369 and Judy Anderson.</p>
<p>The funeral director John O'Looney was also promoted by Miles Guo's bots: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-1-1+john+o%27looney+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2022-1-1+john+o%27looney+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-looneybot.jpg width=500>

<p>The account below posted a clip of a video by Latypova, but the same account has tweeted in languages like French and Italian, and it has tweeted about <span class="quote">"Q drops"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-guobot.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor are the Three Microscope Stooges whose specialty is using an optical microscope to find nanotechnology in COVID vaccines or human blood. All three of them have been promoted by Sasha Latypova and all three of them have appeared on the Stew Peters Show. The Twitter account in the screenshot below posted a link to an interview of Shimon Yanowitz by Stew Peters, but the same account has also posted links to news stories in random European languages. The profile picture of the Twitter account is an emblem of the Australian branch of Miles Guo's Himalaya Supervisory Organization:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yanowitz-bot.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>It's interesting that Himalaya Supervisory Organization has branches on several different continents, just like how Children's Health Defense has a European chapter, an Australian chapter, and an African chapter. Miles Guo's bots seem to promote content both by people associated with CHD and people associated with the Stew Peters Network. Latypova was also a speaker in an event in Sweden that was jointly organized by a Swedish organization and the European chapter of CHD. [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/quick-faq-about-upcoming-events-in>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/quick-faq-about-upcoming-events-in</a>]</p>
<p>Miles Guo's network has a bunch of translators who translate their content to foreign languages. The CHD has a blog called <span class="quote">"The Defender"</span> which is translated to German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. [<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defensor/?lang=es>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defensor/?lang=es</a>] La Quinta Columna's Odysee channel posts videos with subtitles in the same set of languages, except they sometimes also post videos with Russian or Romanian subtitles.</p>
<p>Miles Guo's movement seems like another iteration of the formula that Western intelligence agencies employed to create the Unification Church and Falun Gong, because all three of them had an East Asian figurehead based in New York, all three of them controlled media empires which promoted Christianity and conspiracy content, and all three of them also publish media in various Western languages in addition to East Asian languages. Many of the East Asian people associated with Guo are Christians, like how Dinggang Wang is called Luther because he is a Lutheran (and Limeng Yan is also a Lutheran according to one source but I haven't verified it). The Unification Church also had an arm called CAUSA which operated several newspapers, publishing houses, and radio stations in Latin America. Falun Gong runs an English-language conspiracy video channel called Edge of Wonder TV, which has promoted a lot of junk conspiracies like ancient aliens and QAnon. In February 2020, Guo's news site GNews published an article which said that there was a high concentration of sulphur dioxide over Wuhan which indicated that a massive number of bodies were being burned in Wuhan, but as one of their sources, they cited the website of a Chinese-language radio station called <span class="quote">"Sound of Hope"</span> which is based in the United States and which is ran by Falun Gong. [<a href=https://gnews.org/m/16240>https://gnews.org/m/16240</a>] (Actually earlier on January 5th, some guy on Twitter had already spotted the high sulphur dioxide level over Wuhan, but he said that it came from an aluminum plant which burned petroleum coke to make anodes. [<a href=https://x.com/psravenscroft1/status/1213935504057454592>https://x.com/psravenscroft1/status/1213935504057454592</a>])</p>
<p>The accounts that promote Miles Guo are also promoting Mike Yeadon and Karen Kingston: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=yeadon+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=yeadon+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/search?q=karen+kingston+lang%3Azh&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=karen+kingston+lang%3Azh&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-yeadon.jpg width=400><img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-kingston.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>(The screenshots above show that the Guo accounts post a lot of links to Gettr, but it's probably because Guo's foundation is one of the owners of Gettr, so many of the Guo accounts even use the logo of Gettr as their profile picture. Most of the Guo accounts are probably bots, but Guo's movement also includes members who are known as <span class="quote">"ants"</span> who promote his content in a manner that is sometimes difficult to distinguish from bots.)</p>
<p>The tweet below included a clip of a video where Bret Weinstein talked about DRASTIC which was translated to Chinese with a watermark of the Himalaya Supervisory Organization: [<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-guo-drastic.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Miles Guo's movement has several Discord groups where I believe people who work as Guo's translators post clips of videos from English-language alt media with Chinese subtitles, so the people in the Discord groups might choose themselves which videos they end up translating. So even if Guo's movement would be ran by western intelligence, it doesn't necessarily mean that all of the people whose videos they translate would also be controlled opposition.</p>
<p>In December 2022 Michael P. Senger was one of the first people who started promoting JC's new Scooby Doo theory, because he wrote a long Substack post about one of JC's streams titled <span class="quote">"DRASTIC Founder Renounces Lab Leak Theory of COVID's Origins"</span>. But Senger is also the author of an anti-China book titled <span class="quote">"Snake Oil: How Xi Jinping Shut Down the World"</span>: [<a href=https://www.michaelpsenger.com/p/drastic-founder-renounces-lab-leak>https://www.michaelpsenger.com/p/drastic-founder-renounces-lab-leak</a>]</p>

<p>Michael P. Senger's bio says that <span class="quote">"his work can be found in Tablet Magazine, on Twitter under the handle <span class="citation" data-cites="michaelpsenger">@michaelpsenger</span>, and on Substack at michaelpsenger.substack.com"</span>.

<p>In October 2023 when Israel was totally taken by surprise by Hamas which they did not create and fund themselves, Michael P. Senger tweeted a link to an article by Voice of America, where he quoted text that said: <span class="quote">"Antisemitic remarks have flooded China's heavily censored online platforms...since the Hamas attacks on Israel...

Chinese state-run media has spread the unverified rumor that Israeli forces are using white phosphorus bombs against civilians in a manner that contravenes international law."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714446208696209834>https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714446208696209834</a>] And he tweeted a link to an article by Wall Street Journal which said that China <span class="quote">"has embraced the Palestinian cause in a way it hadn't done in decades. Its once cordial ties with Israel are in tatters."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714063843918299176>https://x.com/michaelpsenger/status/1714063843918299176</a>] Limeng Yan has also posted a large number of similar tweets where she says that CCP is supporting Palestine.

<p>Karen Kingston reminds me of Cyrus Parsa, because both of them pretend to be experts on AI and 5G and they blame everything on China. Cyrus Parsa has a master's degree in homeland security. Celeste Solum also says that she used to work for FEMA and DHS, but she's another one of these people who claim to be former insiders in the system, and who are interviewed by people like Stew Peters and Mike Adams, and who talk about topics like AI, nanotechnology, quantum dots, and hydrogel. I think Cyrus Parsa first entered into alt media through Owen Shroyer's show, which should be a huge red flag. The oldest tweet I found which mentioned Parsa was made in October 2019 by an account called <span class="quote">"Informal Warfare"</span> whose profile picture is a drawing of Alex Jones, and the second oldest tweet I found was a link to an interview that Parsa did with Owen Shroyer the same day. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2019-12-30+%22cyrus+parsa%22&amp;f=live</a>] In December 2019, Parsa filed a lawsuit against <span class="quote">"Google L.L.C, Facebook inc, DeepMind Inc, Alphabet Inc, Neuralink Inc, Tesla Inc, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, CISON PR NewsWire &amp; John Doe's 1-29"</span> for reasons such as <span class="quote">"MISUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, CYBERNETICS, ROBOTICS, BIOMETRICS, BIOENGINEERING, 5G AND QUANTUM COMPUTING TECNNOLOGY, and for transfering AI technology to China, and for violation of several genocide conventions because of China's treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Christians, and Falun Gong"</span>.

Mr. Cyrus Parsa filed a suit against Google, FB and a few others in California. Spread the news. I am calling on the Uyghurs and other freedom lovers to back Mr. Parsa!!!"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/Trailbl16797622/status/1208942910454013953>https://x.com/Trailbl16797622/status/1208942910454013953</a>] (For some reason there seems to be a huge number of these Uyghur separatist accounts on Twitter who post in English.)</p>
<p>The same kind of people who are employed to produce disinformation that is targeted against foreign adversaries are also employed to produce disinformation that is targeted against the domestic population. For example Dr. Eowyn had one of the most popular blogs about Sandy Hook and she wrote three chapters in Jim Fetzer's book about Sandy Hook. In 2016 it was revealed that her real name was Maria Hsia Chang, and that she was a practicioner of Falun Gong and she wrote a book about Falun Gong where she presented them in a favorable light, and that she had written several academic articles which basically promoted the line of Epoch Times on East Asian policy. [<a href=https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/>https://www.crisisactorsguild.com/2016/01/18/who-writes-this-shit-who-is-dr-eowyn/</a>] Her old bio on the website of her university said that she <span class="quote">"is a lecturer for the U. S. Department of Defense's Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, as well as the U. S. Marine Corps War College"</span>. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm>https://web.archive.org/web/20070104091632/http://www.unr.edu/cla/polisci/famaria_hsia_chang.htm</a>] Dr. Eowyn also collaborated with David Weiss, who used to be an assistant of the Sandy Hook hoaxer Wolfgang Halbig. David Weiss later became a flat earther, and in March 2020 he was one of the very first big names in alt media who started to say that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not exist. [<a href=novirus.html#David-Weiss-and-Timothy-Rothschild>novirus.html#David-Weiss-and-Timothy-Rothschild</a>] One video that David Weiss did with Stew Peters was titled <span class="quote">"TRUTH About Flat Earth Theory: Biblical Firmament vs. Round Ball Earth Propaganda"</span>, and the description of the video said: <span class="quote">"This week on Stew Peters premium, we are joined by Dave Weiss to discuss NASA and Big Tech's lies surrounding the shape of the earth we all live on."</span> [<a href=https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/truth-about-flat-earth-theory-biblical-firmament-vs-round-ball-earth-propaganda/>https://stewpeters.com/video/2022/11/truth-about-flat-earth-theory-biblical-firmament-vs-round-ball-earth-propaganda/</a>] In one episode of the Stew Peters Show, the first guest was Emily Grace Rainey who they described as a <span class="quote">"former Special Operations psyop officer"</span>, and the second guest was David Weiss who presented his sales pitch about flat earth. [<a href=https://www.stewpeters.com/video/2022/12/power-blackouts-sweep-nation-former-special-operations-psyop-officer-warns-of-incoming-war/>https://www.stewpeters.com/video/2022/12/power-blackouts-sweep-nation-former-special-operations-psyop-officer-warns-of-incoming-war/</a>] I don't know how long Stew Peters has been a flat earther, but by 2023 he was saying on Twitter that the earth is flat. [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1686187946141999105>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1686187946141999105</a>, <a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1695953001599349218>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1695953001599349218</a>, <a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1642979962318643204>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1642979962318643204</a>]</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon recommended people to listen to interviews of the flat earther Sage of Quay: <span class="quote">"If you don't yet have that understanding, that a small group of powerful families have organised the way the world works with increasing precision down the centuries, it will be harder to see the otherwise <span class="quote">'hidden hand'</span>. I recommend listening to recent interviews given by Mike Williams aka Sage of Quay."</span> [<a href=https://suavek1.substack.com/p/the-arguments-for-no-virus-part-8>https://suavek1.substack.com/p/the-arguments-for-no-virus-part-8</a>] Sage of Quay was one of the many flat earthers who were early promoters of the no-virus theory. His blog has now been deleted and his posts weren't archived at the Wayback Machine, but he seems to have posted videos about the no-virus theory Owen Benjamin and David Icke in early April 2020, and he may have already written about the theory in March 2020.

<p>In October 2022, Latypova posted an interview she did with David Nixon on BitChute. The description of the video said: <span class="quote">"I recently spoke with Dr. David Nixon who was able to conduct several experiments with Pfizer injectable substance under standard optical microscope. David found that when the sample is shielded from electromagnetic field by the Faraday bag no assembly happens in it. When the slide is left overnight near a wifi router, square shaped structures appear, and then continue to grow for a long period of time."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/amzAJHl5TVfZ/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/amzAJHl5TVfZ/</a>]</p>
<p>The interview David Nixon did with Latypova is the oldest interview listed on his website: [<a href=https://drdavidnixon.com>https://drdavidnixon.com</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-david-nixon.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>However I found two people who had interviewed Nixon before Latypova, who were Maria Zeee and Ana Maria Mihalcea. [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational/M%C3%A1s-hallazgos-de-nano-y-microtecnolog%C3%ADa-dentro-de-las-vacunas-COVID-19%2e>https://odysee.com/%40laquintacolumnainternational/M%C3%A1s-hallazgos-de-nano-y-microtecnolog%C3%ADa-dentro-de-las-vacunas-COVID-19%2e</a>, <a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>] Nixon's interview with Maria Zeee was translated by La Quinta Columna to French, Spanish, and Portuguese, and the translated versions were mirrored by several channels on Rumble, BitChute, and Odysee.</p>
<p>Latypova posted several tweets like this where she promoted David Nixon's microscope images: [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706455087512740183>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1706455087512740183</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-smartbubbles.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In October 2022, Latypova even wrote an article about David Nixon's microscope imagery for trialsitenews.com, where she didn't have anything critical to say about Nixon's images, but she just wrote that the rectangular structures that were shown in the videos were not cholesterol or salt crystals: [<a href=https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119>https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/direct-microscopic-examination-of-pfizers-covid-19-injections-contents-of-the-vials-are-interacting-with-electromagnetic-fields%2e-0d437119</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-trialsite.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>In 2022 Maria Zeee broke the news that David Nixon had found self-assembling robot arms in COVID vaccines. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v1prv94-world-first-robotic-arms-assembling.html>https://rumble.com/v1prv94-world-first-robotic-arms-assembling.html</a>] At time 8:52, Maria Zeee said: <span class="quote">"I want to ask you, Dr. Nixon, because it looks like little robot arms, even."</span> Then Nixon circled the part of the video below where I added the red circle, and he said: <span class="quote">"This is - this - you look at the way the levers are working in this - but, you know that - you've got triangles, you've got levers, you've got pinchers. [...] It even falls up on itself, goes up to get the leverage. [...] It creates some sort of a propulsion system, I mean, you look at the rotation on <em>that</em>."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-robot-arm.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Nixon has said that his photos were taken with a regular optical microscope at 400-fold or 2000-fold magnification level. However Ana Maria Mihalcea wrote that one of Nixon's photos featured a <span class="quote">"carbon nanotube"</span>: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>http://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000%2a/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-nanotube.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Nixon's videos actually even display the real contents of vaccine vials, but if they do, then the crystallized structures may be cholesterol, because cholesterol is an ingredient of the Pfizer vaccines: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20210527170119/https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download>http://web.archive.org/web/20210527170119/https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-cholesterol.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In September 2022, Latypova published a video on BitChute where she interviewed the Israeli electric engineer Shimon Yanowitz, who showed photos of his blood under a light microscope. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/</a>] The description of the video said that <span class="quote">"the images show disturbing changes which are typical of the blood after Covid-19 injections, yet Shimon did not have the shots"</span>. Yanowitz said that the objects in his blood may have come from either shedding or chemtrails. At time 9:48, he said that the <span class="quote">"ribbon"</span> in the photo below might be Morgellons, and that it looked <span class="quote">"very mean"</span> and that it made red blood cells nervous: <span class="quote">"How did this ribbon - we can maybe elaborate a lot, we can discuss if this is something called Morgellons or another thing - but this seems to be composed of the same material - maybe carbon-based - that we see in the jabbed people. And this is very worrying, because I shouldn't be having it. We can see it's not natural. It's definitely not organic. And it looks very mean. And it's not the end of the story. And, so, you can also see that the red blood cells are getting very nervous around this entity."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-latypova-yanowitz.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 13:55 in the interview with Latypova, Yanowitz said: <span class="quote">"And this is just a tiny drop from my finger, and we can see all these dinosaurs emerging from this tiny blood drop."</span> (So maybe we can add dinosaurs to the list of objects that the Stew crew has found in blood or vaccines... Even though actually Yanowitz just used the word dinosaur as a descriptive term for a type of object that was visible in the photos, but I bet a certain percentage of his audience thinks that it's real dinosaurs.)</p>
<p>Latypova seemed to accept Yanowitz's claims at face value and she didn't ask him any tough questions, just like was the case with her interview with David Nixon. So is it a coincidence that Latypova did her alt media debut on the Stew Peters Show and she is promoting all of these Stew ops?</p>
<p>The oldest BitChute video I found that featured Yanowitz was an interview he did with the no-virus Jew Tom Cowan. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=shimon+yanowitz>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=shimon+yanowitz</a>] The oldest tweets which match the name Shimon Yanowitz in double quotes are also about his interview with Tom Conman.

<p>I believe Karen Kingston made her alt media debut in July 2021 when she appeared first on the TV show of Doug Billings and next on the Stew Peters Show. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22karen+kingston%22+until%3A2021-7-29&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22karen+kingston%22+until%3A2021-7-29&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://www.bek.news/therightside/fe0c4a3a-d139-472b-ad84-da00938fd881/>https://www.bek.news/therightside/fe0c4a3a-d139-472b-ad84-da00938fd881/</a>] The show of Doug Billings is aired on BEK TV, which is a cable TV channel where they also air the Stew Peters Show, and Stew Peters is mentioned in about a quarter of the TV channel's most recent Facebook posts. [<a href=https://www.facebook.com/bektvnews>https://www.facebook.com/bektvnews</a>] When Karen Kingston first appeared on the shows of Doug Billings and Stew Peters, she was presented as a former Pfizer employee whose big revelation was that COVID vaccines contain graphene oxide and hydrogel: [<a href=https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/>https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/former-pfizer-employee-confirms-poison-in-covid-vaccine/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stew Peters brings us another blockbuster interview with Karen Kingston, a former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She comes forward with indisputable documentation that must be shared with the ENTIRE WORLD, immediately.</p>
<p>She says, <span class="quote">"I read the patent to look for graphene oxide. It is not listed in the patent because it is a trade secret. Remember, Bill Gates saying that there was a trade secret?"</span> However, the Chinese patent does list graphene oxide. She says the main reason it's not listed in the US patent is because graphene oxide is poisonous and it's well-known that it's poisonous. The other reason is because it's the main ingredient of Hydrogel, which is the liquid AI template that's used for some of Elon Musk's research and Bill Gates, as far as creating an interface between humans and the internet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Karen Kingston later also started to say that COVID vaccines contained hydras and snake venom. In 2021 Stew Peters asked her: <span class="quote">"So you are equivocally saying that hydra exists in this shots?"</span> Then she answered: <span class="quote">"Transgenic hydra does. So transgenic hydra is like a chimeric virus. It's when you take an organism and you artificially induce DNA from other organisms, other species, into that organism."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/NJqVMmI0b2DV/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/NJqVMmI0b2DV/</a>, time 7:25] The description of an episode of The Stew Peters Show from 2022 said: <span class="quote">"This segment of The Stew Peters Show brings on another researcher of the COVID-19 Snake Venom theory, Karen Kingston!

<p>In a Substack post in 2023 Latypova wrote: [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/covid-and-marburg-weapons-systems>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/covid-and-marburg-weapons-systems</a>]</p>

<p>It could be that injecting as much DARPA hydrogel as possible in as many people as possible was the primary goal.</p>
<p>The goal maybe twofold - kill off whatever % they can do with plausible deniability in the first round of covid/injections where approximately 5% of vials/doses end up being extremely toxic. By doing this, they identify the population that can tolerate the injections of hydrogel materials, the ones that don't die off right away, and that are brainwashed and obedient enough to continue jabbing themselves. Then <span class="quote">"demonstrate"</span> the 2 vector and tell them - we can control you now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2023 Latypova was on InfoWars, she said: <span class="quote">"I have some anecdotal evidence from the various sources that are reliable - that they don't have an incentive to lie about this. And I personally recorded the video with a researcher in Australia. We were looking at a common brand of dental anesthetic under microscope, just simply looking as it dries, just a drop of it drying under microscope. And we observed a bizarre chemical process - or you know, the physical chemical process - that is not consistent with just being kind of a suspension in water solution of lidocaine. It was clearly hydrogel. And hydrogels are used in injection in various materials - various medical materials - but they should be disclosed. This wasn't disclosed anywhere. And hydrogels are used to increase the stability of a fragile component, or increase the circulation time in the body, or stability. And so maybe that's why they formulated it this way, but they don't disclose it."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/</a>, time 35:55] Near the end of the interview Jane Ruby asked if there's also hydrogel in the white long calamari clots that have supposedly been found by embalmers and funeral directors like Richard Hirschman, but Latypova answered that hydrogel is probably incorporated into the calamari clots.

<p>Karen Kingston also wrote: <span class="quote">"Smart hydrogel is the key nanobiotechnology that creates the deadly clots featured in Died Suddenly."</span> [<a href=https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech>https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/millions-of-self-assembling-nanotech</a>]</p>
<p>In September 2023 Latypova tweeted a photo of a glass vial with the text: <span class="quote">"Pfizer injections are hydrogel. Visible right here."</span> Someone posted this reply: <span class="quote">"Odd that with over 100 vials analyzed, I've never seen anything like what you are represented here. What is this? Where did it come from and what did you add?"</span> But Latypova replied: <span class="quote">"This is a photo from Pfizer manufacturing line in US. Manual inspection of vax vials. I have talked to many scientists and doctors and there are hours of video footage of the vials (ex-US) and they confirm the substance prior to dilution is hydrogel.

<p>In 2023 Latypova did a video about hydrogel in dental anesthetic with David Nixon and Shimon Yanowitz. Her blog post about the video said: <span class="quote">"Shimon Yanowitz, a researcher from Israel joined me and David on a zoom call to observe in real time what happens with a common dental anesthetic injectable under microscope. The brand of anesthetic is Septodont and the product name is Lignospan. David placed a drop of it on a microscope slide and simply observed as it was drying. The process revealed that the substance is likely hydrogel due to the <span class="quote">'bubbling'</span> phenomenon as it dries. The process becomes more energetic when a cellphone is placed next to the sample."</span> [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/looking-at-dental-anesthetic-under</a>]</p>
<p>Someone made a compilation of video clips about dental anesthetic, which featured a clip where Latypova told Jane Ruby that people should avoid getting sustained release dental anesthetic because it contains hydrogel, and a clip where Latypova talked to Jane Ruby about her video with David Nixon: [<a href=https://rumble.com/v3yffiq-dental-anaesthetics-graphenenanotech.html>https://rumble.com/v3yffiq-dental-anaesthetics-graphenenanotech.html</a>]</p>

<p>In July 2023 Totality of Evidence compiled a timeline of videos about dental anesthetic, where the earliest entry was about Mat Taylor's interview with Stew Peters: [<a href=https://totalityofevidence.com/dental-anaesthetics-nanotech/>https://totalityofevidence.com/dental-anaesthetics-nanotech/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-dentaltotality.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Latypova also had an original theory that variation in batch lethality might be explained by variation in the level of hydrogel in the batches: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230712153341/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/more-on-the-issue-of-placebo-batches>http://web.archive.org/web/20230712153341/https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/more-on-the-issue-of-placebo-batches</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am fairly certain that there were no saline placebo batches in broad commercial distribution (with exception of televised injections of government officials and dedicated Pfizer/Moderna employee batches). Here is why.</p>
<p>Vax substance visually looks different from normal saline, because it is formulated as a special type of hydrogel. Very likely it's what is called DARPA hydrogel, stuff that places like Robert Langer lab at MIT and Charles Lieber lab at Harvard work on.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Also, Melissa MacAtee, a whistleblower from Pfizer Chesterfield manufacturing facility reported this appearance of substance in vials. It glows opalescent blue, because it is a hydrogel:</p>
<p><img src=i/pfizerstew-mcatee-hydrogel.webp width=160></p>
<p>She reported that Pfizer placed labels on vials unusually low to hide the substance, but it could still be visible when the product is handled anywhere in the supply chain. Therefore, if there were vials of saline amongst vials with hydrogel, someone would notice this. Too much risk of accidental detection by people who are not in on the scam.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>So, there could be a possibility that Pfizer <span class="quote">"dilutant"</span> is empty LNP (hydrogel). It is possible to formulate a thin version of hydrogel such that it looks like water. In the places where it was used people would get higher toxicity events and in other places where they got their own saline procured - would be lower toxicity.</p>
<p>My current conclusion is that all vials are hydrogel, and some contain more concentrated toxic biological materials (nucleic acid chains), plasmid DNA, toxic metals and other garbage. Empty hydrogel is not benign, but it also gets unevenly diluted during vaccination, and that results in another level of heterogeneity which explains why many people don't have any side effects. Some doses end up being mostly saline with a bit of hydrogel that does not cause much damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Substack post I quoted above, Latypova referred to the <span class="quote">"Pfizer whistleblower"</span> Melissa McAtee. The earliest tweet about her I found was from October 2021, when she appeared on Project Veritas as a whistleblower who said that Pfizer vaccines contain luciferace and graphene oxide. [<a href=https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-leaks-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-internal-emails-from-chief>https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-leaks-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-internal-emails-from-chief</a>] She was soon later interviewed by Candace Owens on DailyWire and by the MyPillow guy's cohost on Lindell TV, and an article about her was published by Red Voice Media, and the next month she also appeared on Stew Peters.

<p>When Karen Kingston first emerged in alt media, her two big reveleations were that COVID vaccines contained graphene oxide and that COVID vaccines contained hydrogel. Even though Latypova pushed the story about hydrogel, she said that Kingston's story about graphene oxide was fake: <span class="quote">"This is based on a fake story in Expose which was fed to everyone by Karen Kingston. She designed that fake story knowingly, as she is competent enough to read the Pfizer report quoted and see it was not about the GO in the jab composition. this is how fake diversions are made"</span>.

The Pfizer document is unrelated to vax ingredients, it's just an imaging experiment where graphene is used for cryo-EM imaging set up. Karen Kingston mislead a bunch of good people. <a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/pfizer-evidence-of-graphene-oxide>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/pfizer-evidence-of-graphene-oxide</a>"</span>.

<p>In November 2022, Reiner Füllmich's International Crimes Investigative Committee hosted a panel about nanotechnology. The main stars of the panel were Shimon Yanowitz and David Nixon, who claimed that they had used a light microscope to find self-assembling structures in their blood and in COVID vaccines. It was the first time when Mike Yeadon was featured as a co-host of Füllmich's panel (even though to Yeadon's credit, he actually said in a polite way that the evidence presented by Nixon and Yanowitz was not very convincing): [<a href=https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/icic-international-crimes-investigative>https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/icic-international-crimes-investigative</a>]</p>

<p>In September 2023, Latypova posted a Substack article where she recommended people to watch a video by Mat Taylor where he claimed that he found nanotechnology in COVID vaccines with an optical microscope.

<p>David Nixon's website has a section for <span class="quote">"Important Videos from my Colleagues"</span>, which features videos by Latypova, Mihalcea, and Mat Taylor: [<a href=https://drdavidnixon.com/1/en/topic/important-videos-from-my-colleagues>https://drdavidnixon.com/1/en/topic/important-videos-from-my-colleagues</a>]</p>

<p>Latypova posted this reply to a Twitter thread about Jane Ruby: <span class="quote">"I don't know what the <span class="quote">'correct'</span> position on GO and snake venom. Do you? These are open questions. Snake venom (and many other venoms) as synthetic peptides is backbone of medicinal chemistry for example."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1665017138447360000>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1665017138447360000</a>] She also said this about Ruby: <span class="quote">"I have not seen her saying anything that's false. Please check your sources of information. If you have anything you can point to that she said was really not true, please let me know. Not just difference in opinion"</span>.

<p>In September 2022 Latypova was interviewed by Ana Maria Mihalcea. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/gNvF3fCvNMth>https://www.bitchute.com/video/gNvF3fCvNMth</a>] At time 47:43 Latypova said <span class="quote">"we have some electrical engineers in our group"</span>. She may have referred to Shimon Yanowitz and Mat Taylor who were members of the IIRT group, because David Nixon said that Latypova was a member of IIRT. [<a href=https://drdavidnixon.com/1/en/topic/week-9>https://drdavidnixon.com/1/en/topic/week-9</a>]</p>
<p>At time 48:03 Latypova said: <span class="quote">"I believe there is an interaction between what materials are being pumped into the people through these injections and other means. And the, the telecommunications aspect, because - you know, and I just started discussing it and I will be with the next expert, we'll be talking more about it - but they told me, you know, 5G - the difference between 5G and all the previous Wi-Fi's is that if 5G is beam-forming. The other ones were, you know, you just kind of spread it around and once it spread around, it doesn't really hit anything, you know, in so much energy. What happens with the beam-forming, it concentrates energy. And for example, if you are, if I am here on my cell phone, I have this material in my body that is super conductive like graphene, I'm on my cell phone. And then as behind me, if 5G is beam-forming, it's going to hit me because it's trying to access my cell phone. And I can be in the, in the direct hit of this energy that then going through me will find graphene. And it will increase and, you know, graphene can resonate at much higher frequency. And it will create energy, it will create micro burst of energy where that graphene exists in my body."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:00:23, Latypova said: <span class="quote">"Now as far as what is being shed, it's hard to say. It could be spike protein, but it could also be something that also induces spike protein creation in your body. So I don't think spike protein necessarily needs to be coded for by mRNA. I think it's just a product of destruction of cells. And so it can be induced by other means, such as in different materials, nanoparticulate contaminants, maybe metals, any types of toxicity - cellular toxicity - I'm pretty sure can produce it."</span></p>
<hr />
<p>By 2024 Latypova said she was sure nanobots and microchips were a psyop: <span class="quote">"I know for sure it's part of the informational psyops campaign because, again, limited messaging, continuous repeated messaging of the same thing and a lot of anonymous bots running around and anonymous large accounts online promoting the same BS, ok. And it is BS because - and I've seen - and I know some of the people, and interact with them, who are looking at these things in the microscope."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5gnghp-sasha-latypova.html?start=4593>https://rumble.com/v5gnghp-sasha-latypova.html?start=4593</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2023 Latypova wrote that she was agnostic about whether vaccines contained graphine oxide: <span class="quote">"Does graphene oxide exist? Yes! Is it in the covid injections? Could be! As I wrote previously, my current educated guess is that GO is the <span class="quote">'new asbestos'</span> that can be legally used in making of food and drugs (because there are no regulations of it). Among new materials uses as drug carriers, graphene oxide has been widely used due to its high biocompatibility with a high drug loading capacity. It is likely used in filtration or as a component of hydrogels used in the injectable mRNA vaxxes and possibly other injectable drugs now. Specifically, GO is well dispersed in an aqueous solution, which significantly enhances the interfacial bonding within the components, and transfer stress efficiently. These advantages make GO an attractive nanocomposite material as a drug carrier in the field of biomedicine and biotechnology, while being combined with a polymer or inorganic matrix (which is what DARPA hydrogel is - a polymer matrix)."</span> [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/why-i-dismiss-nanotechnology-and>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/why-i-dismiss-nanotechnology-and</a>]</p>

<p>At the end of Latypova's article about David Nixon's microchips, she wrote that the source of her article was a paper by David Hughes titled <span class="quote">"What is in the so-called COVID-19 <span class="quote">'Vaccines'</span>? Part 1: Evidence of a Global Crime Against Humanity"</span>.

[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52</a>]</p>
<p>In the paper Hughes presented microscope images by various researchers, which showed that vaccines contained structures like microchips, hydras, Morgellons fibers, nanoantennas, motherboards, graphene oxide razor blades, carbon nanotubes, nano-octopuses, mesospores, SIM cards, <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> parasites, hydrogel, microbubbles, long stick-like organisms, parasites attached to magnets, eggs that were hatching new structures, dark crystals, microelectric circuitry, and so on. And he wrote that the researchers must be onto something because <span class="quote">"at least 26 different investigations of the <span class="quote">'vaccine'</span> contents (almost entirely unrelated to one another) from 16 different countries on five continents converge on remarkably similar findings"</span>. Hughes said this about his paper: <span class="quote">"The article is 132 pages long. Even if some of the evidence presented might have an innocent explanation, certainly not all of it does, and most of it, in my opinion, quite obviously looks nefarious."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/NKxjTRgM0tGn>https://www.bitchute.com/video/NKxjTRgM0tGn</a>, 3:35]</p>
<p>In April 2022 before Latypova had started her Substack, she wrote a long article about the Pfizer trials that was published by Solari. [<a href=https://solari.com/review-of-pfizers-non-clinical-program-by-sasha-latypova/>https://solari.com/review-of-pfizers-non-clinical-program-by-sasha-latypova/</a>] Latypova later presented the article in the fourth symposium of Doctors for COVID Ethics, which was organized by D4CE in collaboration with CHD, Solari, and UK Column. [<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-iv-freedom-is-the-cure/>https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-iv-freedom-is-the-cure/</a>]</p>
<p>The fifth D4CE symposium featured presentations by Catherine Austin Fitts, two other people from Solari, Sasha Latypova, and the nanobot propagandist trio of Daniel Broudy, David Hughes, and Valerie Kyrie.

The thumbnail of their presentation showed one of David Nixon's microscope images, and a follow-up article to their presentation was published by Solari.

<p>A bio of David Hughes says that he lectures in security studies and his areas of research include <span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span class="quote">"the class relations between psychological operations"</span>. [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>] Valerie Kyrie's bio says that she is <span class="quote">"working in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that her <span class="quote">"doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32</a>] Daniel Broudy used to serve in military intelligence but he is now an expert on propaganda. Broudy and Kyrie have also coauthored two papers about nanotechnology in vaccines that were published by IJVTPR.</p>
<p>The editorial board of IJVTPR includes Daniel Broudy and Shimon Yanowitz, but it also includes Mary Holland and Brian Hooker from CHD. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>] And it includes Mark Skidmore who coauthored articles about the <span class="quote">"missing money"</span> with Catherine Austin Fitts, and who conducted a vaccine survey that was funded by Fitts. Skidmore also pushed stories about graphene razor blades and vaccine-induced magnetism.

<p>In 2024 Solari named David Hughes as their hero of the week. [<a href=https://solari.com/hero-of-the-week-april-29-2024-david-a-hughes/>https://solari.com/hero-of-the-week-april-29-2024-david-a-hughes/</a>] In 2024 Fitts interviewed Hughes about psychological warfare.

<p>In 2024 and 2025, Fitts organized two <span class="quote">"Omniwar"</span> symposiums that were livestreamed by CHD, and that featured a similar cast of characters as the earlier symposiums hosted by Doctors for COVID Ethics. Both Omniwar symposiums featured presentations by David Hughes and Daniel Broudy. A tweet about the second symposium said: <span class="quote">"The Solari Report and Catherine, collaborating with the four members of the Study Group on Technology and Power - technocracy expert Patrick Wood (<span class="citation" data-cites="StopTechnocracy">@StopTechnocracy</span>) and scholars David A.

<p>The pinned post on David Nixon's Substack promotes a book by David Hughes. [<a href=https://davidnixon.substack.com/p/covid-19-psychological-operations>https://davidnixon.substack.com/p/covid-19-psychological-operations</a>] The book featured endorsements by five people, who were Catherine Austin Fitts, Daniel Broudy, the nanobot microscopist guy Mat Taylor, and two people I was not familiar with (Bruce Scott and Kees van der Pijl).</p>
<p>The Omniwar symposium also featured a presentation about nanotechnology by Lissa Johnson, whose bio says: <span class="quote">"Dr. Lissa Johnson is an independent researcher who writes about the psychological aspects of public affairs, psychological operations, human rights abuse, citizenship, and the exercise and abuse of power. Her qualifications include undergraduate degrees in media studies and in behavioural science, with an honours thesis in neuroimmunology, an MA in clinical psychology, and a PhD on the psychological processes involved in manipulating reality-perception."</span> [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/author/r_f29phidn_84_al7q/>https://propagandainfocus.com/author/r_f29phidn_84_al7q/</a>] So she even did her PhD degree on the manipulation of reality perception, just like Valerie Kyrie. I wonder what kind of employment opportunities there are for people who are experts on the manipulation of reality perception.</p>
<p>In 2024 the CHD came under fire because they published an interview of Ana Maria Mihalcea, who said that she saw nanobots and quantum dots in vaccines under a microscope, that she and David Nixon found microchips that emitted MAC addresses in vaccines, that there's MAC addresses emitted from graves, that calamari clots are formed when nanobots eat red blood cells, that calamari clots contain the same polymers that are being sprayed in chemtrails, and that there's microelectronics from chemtrails in the blood of wild deer.

CHD responded to criticism of the video by saying that Mihalcea's claims were backed up by a presentation by Lissa Johnson in the first Omniwar symposium: [<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1846270778649550882>https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1846270778649550882</a>]</p>

<p>CHD's CEO Mary Holland has degrees in Russian and Soviet studies, she spent a semester in the USSR in college, and she studied Soviet law under a Federal Language Area Studies scholarship program. [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-holland/details/education/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-holland/details/education/</a>] The Wikipedia article about area studies says: <span class="quote">"Area studies programs originated within the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor agency to the CIA"</span>. [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_studies>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_studies</a>] The same article says: <span class="quote">"Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism - including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the CIA, the FBI, and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state."</span> Her scholarship program was previously called the National Defence Foreign Language Fellowship program, which was funded by the National Defense Education Act. [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Language_Area_Studies>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Language_Area_Studies</a>] Mary Holland later also worked for three years in Moscow, and she wrote a book titled <em>Human Rights and Legal Reform in the Russian Federation</em> for an NGO called Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.

<p>The director of the <span class="quote">"Children's Health Defense Military Chapter"</span> is Pam Long, whose bio says that she <span class="quote">"served as a medical intelligence officer for NATO Stabilization Forces"</span>. [<a href=https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/pam-long/>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/pam-long/</a>] In October 2020 the CHD published her article where she said that there was a plan to incorporate hydrogel nanotechnology in COVID vaccines, and that the technology would have enabled tracking people remotely, and it may have been connected to a DARPA program to create supersoldiers.

<p>In 2025 CHD posted a video where Suzanne Humphries said that she saw structures that looked like microchips in vaccines under a microscope.

And she said that there's mysterious ingredients in vaccines and mysterious ingredients in chemtrails, and that one purpose of the ingredients is to <span class="quote">"install an operating system in your body"</span>.</p>
<p>After people criticized Suzanne Humphries for her claim about the microchips, she wrote on Twitter: <span class="quote">"I find the gaslighting very interesting.

I once had a website called life of the blood. Now my videos are only on BITCHUTE because I don't have to pay to put them there.

However, as Youngmi Lee and Daniel Broudy wrote in 2024, <span class="quote">'a reflexive and singular focus on the declared components of the COVID injectables represents a bias of its own, and a lack of due diligence on our critics'</span> part.'"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/solari_the/status/1942674895214612828>https://x.com/solari_the/status/1942674895214612828</a>]</p>
<p>Catherine Austin Fitts was one of the earliest big names in alt media who started promoting the no-virus theory, because in April 2020 she published a series of videos by Jon Rappoport about how viruses are not real.

<p>When Fitts was the Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the secretary of HUD was Jack Kemp, who was a 33rd degree freemason, Bohemian Grove attendee, CNP member, and a friend of Larry King of Franklin Scandal fame (not the guy with suspenders).

Its main star was Catherine Austin Fitts but it also featured David Martin. [<a href=https://arlingtoninstitute.org/transitiontalks/past-speakers/>https://arlingtoninstitute.org/transitiontalks/past-speakers/</a>]</p>
<p>David Martin did many of his earliest appearances in alt media together with Sacha Stone, but Sacha Stone was another one of the earliest big names in alt media who started to say that viruses are not real. Around the year 2010, Sacha Stone was the <span class="quote">"Director-General of Europe"</span> of the Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Organization, and David Martin was the chairman of IREO's <span class="quote">"Economic Innovations Committee"</span>.

<p>In May 2022 Jane Ruby organized an event at Palm Beach called <span class="quote">"Pharmaceutical Insider Expose"</span>, where the speakers consisted of David Martin, Sasha Latypova, Karen Kingston, and Mike Yeadon: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20220503133508/https://truthaboutbigpharma.wordpress.com/>http://web.archive.org/web/20220503133508/https://truthaboutbigpharma.wordpress.com/</a>]</p>

<p>Sasha Latypova's company iCardiac conducted clinical trials, but David Martin was also the president of a company called Mosaic Tech which worked with clinical trials.

<p>In July 2023 David Martin did an interview with Alec Zeck where he said that viruses are not real, that nucleic acids are not real, that DNA is not real, and that atoms are not real.

</h2>
<p>On the howbad.info website, the members of Team Enigma are listed as Mike Yeadon, Alexandra Latypova, Craig Paardekooper, Walter Wagner, and Jessica Rose (in that order). [<a href=https://www.howbad.info/background.html>https://www.howbad.info/background.html</a>]</p>
<p>Around two months before Latypova presented Team Enigma's data on the Stew Peters Show in January 2022, Expose News published two articles about Team Enigma's findings. The first article was titled <span class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - 100% of Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of the batches produced according to official Government data"</span>, and the second article was titled <span class="quote">"EXCLUSIVE - VAERS data shows 100% of reported Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of batches produced and the majority were sent to red Republican States across the USA"</span>.

<p>In October 2021 Steve Kirsch emailed the other article by Expose News to WelcomeTheEagle88, Jessica Rose, and Mathew Crawford, after which they started investigating the data, and WelcomeTheEagle88 emailed Craig Paardekooper about some errors in the data. [<a href=https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/jj-couey-george-webb-latypova-hot>https://welcometheeagle.substack.com/p/jj-couey-george-webb-latypova-hot</a>] Then WelcomeTheEagle88 wrote that afterwards Yeadon joined Team Enigma through Kirsch's circle: <span class="quote">"It was shortly after this that Mike Yeadon was putting his feelers out basically looking for Team Enigma through Steve Kirsch and friends. I can't find the email, but I actually responded to Dr. Yeadon, I actually thought he was looking for me?"</span> WelcomeTheEagle88 also wrote: <span class="quote">"it was Team Enigma aka Craig Paardekooper and Sasha Latypova that were first out of the gate with lot# number analysis and then the help of Dr. Mike Yeadon, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, and Reiner Fuellmich the story and Team Enigma launched"</span>.</p>
<p>Latypova also said that she was in contact with Kirsch in 2021 (even though at that point I believe she hadn't appeared anywhere on alt media): <span class="quote">"I told Steve the product was adulterated in 2021, he dismissed me and my analysis as <span class="quote">'conspiracy'</span>, he actually used that word."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1716113671955354057>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1716113671955354057</a>]</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon said: <span class="quote">"I was at the scene of the accident. The person who did the work originally was a British guy called Craig Paardekooper, Craig Paardekooper. And Sasha Latypova and Mike Yeadon saw this and we made a b-line [?] for him. And that's how Sasha, Mike, and Craig met. So I didn't make any contribution to the analysis, except to say it cannot be tolerable that we have this degree of batch-to-batch variation."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5b8FB1FhY0&t=47m15m>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5b8FB1FhY0&amp;t=47m15m</a>]</p>
<p>I believe Jane Ruby had also discussed the articles by Expose News in 2021 before she interviewed Latypova in January 2022, so I don't know if that's how she came to be connected to Team Enigma and Latypova. However at the start of one of Jane Ruby's interviews with Latypova, Ruby said: <span class="quote">"My guest today is someone very special, who I've worked with really since the beginning of the entire COVID scam in 2020."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6wSCNCHm1dUa/</a>, time 14:53] That was news to me, because I haven't found any references to Latypova in alt media before 2022. So did she do her debut interview with Stew Peters and Jane Ruby because she had known Jane Ruby long before then? Ruby and Latypova have both talked about how they know a lot people in the pharmaceutical industry because they used to work for the industry, so is that also how they knew each other?</p>
<p>In May 2021 when Jane Ruby was a guest host for Owen Shroyer's War Room show, she also interviewed WelcomeTheEagle88 about VAERS data. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/iwW55F7hHdmw/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/iwW55F7hHdmw/</a>]</p>
<p>Expose News is kind of a shady outlet, or it appears to be like the British equivalent of Red Voice Media's news site, because both of them have published a large number of articles about stories that are covered on the Stew Peters Network. For example Expose News has published articles about David Nixon's story that COVID vaccines contain self-assembling microchips, Bryan Ardis's story that COVID is caused by snake venom in the tap water and that COVID jabs contain snake venom, and Carrie Madej's story that COVID jabs contain hydras.

<p>Latypova said this about Yeadon's role in Team Enigma: <span class="quote">"Mike Yeadon helped me get the work published in Expose (UK), but he did not do this analysis himself. He presented my work at the Corona Investigative Committee, he asked me and I of course was happy for him to do so. He was very supportive, he looked at our analyses and provided feedback."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1938004409696604254>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1938004409696604254</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>I had the impression that Latypova and Yeadon did presentations of Team Enigma's work in alt media but most of the work was done by Craig Paardekooper. However Latypova said: <span class="quote">"However I AM THE FIRST AUTHOR of batch variability analysis, I FOUND IT FIRST and published on it, and Craig read my work and verified for himself. Craig and I launched the website together, he was broke and I paid for it to be hosted for a while."</span> [<a href=https://openvaet.substack.com/p/from-opioids-and-fraud-to-maga-and/comment/134006909>https://openvaet.substack.com/p/from-opioids-and-fraud-to-maga-and/comment/134006909</a>]</p>

<p>La Quinta Columna is the Spanish group which supposedly first found out that COVID jabs contain graphene oxide, but Jane Ruby brags about how she was the first to break La Quinta Columna's story in English-language media, and she also says that she broke the news about Richard Hirschman's calamari clots: [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1619624953036558338</a>, <a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1604355938881789952</a>]</p>

<p>If the calamari clots were caused by COVID vaccines, then why was the story about the calamari clots breaking news more than a year after the jabs had been rolled out? When I searched Twitter for <code>embalmer clot until:2022-1-27</code>, I didn't find any references to the calamari clots that predated Hirschman's interview with Jane Ruby. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=embalmer+clot+until%3A2022-1-27&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=embalmer+clot+until%3A2022-1-27&amp;f=live</a>] I only found a few tweets which linked to an article from September 2021 titled <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'The Clots Were The Size Of Pancakes'</span> - Texas Embalmer Opens Up About Covid Horrors"</span>, but the clots discussed in the article weren't the kind of long white clots that Hirschman is supposed to have found.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby also tweeted that she was the first to find Richard Hirschman <span class="quote">"through a source"</span>: <span class="quote">"That is my story, that is the story upon which that movie/documentary was made and I was left out. I am that story, I found the Embalmer through a source, I've vetted him over weeks, and I broke the story worldwide in an exclusive Jan 2022"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1645423764304191492>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1645423764304191492</a>] Mathew Crawford said: <span class="quote">"Note that it was DMED whistleblower Theresa Long who <span class="quote">'found'</span> Hirschman."</span></p>
<p>In a Substack post from January 2022 where Kirsch posted a link to Jane Ruby's video, he wrote: [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/worldwide-exclusive-embalmers-find</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got a text of images from Pierre Kory. He asked me to guess what he sent.</p>
<p>I thought they were images from Ryan Cole.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>He said these were from an embalmer and referred me to Lt. Col. Theresa Long who knows the embalmer.</p>
<p>Funeral Director and embalmer Richard Hirschman reveals, for the first time ever, arteries and veins filled with unnatural blood clot combinations with strange fibrous materials that are completely filling the vascular system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe Steve Kirsch was the second person in alt media after Jane Ruby who interviewed Richard Hirschman. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=richard%20hirschman>https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=richard%20hirschman</a>] Kirsch has published two surveys about the calamari clots that were done by Tom Haviland who is a retired Major General in the Air Force. In the second survey published in 2024, 197 out of the 269 embalmers surveyed are supposed to have answered yes to a question that asked if they had seen the calamari clots in corpses that they embalmed in the year 2023. [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/embalmer-survey-2023-over-75-are>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/embalmer-survey-2023-over-75-are</a>] Theresa Long was described as <span class="quote">"an aviation safety officer and Army flight surgeon"</span>, so it's interesting that she and Haviland have both served in the Air Force.</p>
<p>Kirsch also posted the list below which was purported to show a quarterly percentage of embalming cases with the new type of clots seen by Richard Hirschman. But it seems like made up data similar to Kirsch's data from the anonymous military doctor, and Kirsch didn't even provide any methodology or details of how the percentages were calculated (and if really a new type of clots was seen in about half of dead people, then why wouldn't it be mentioned in genuine scientific publications?): [<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1883344288467357848>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1883344288467357848</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-kirschtable.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Kirsch also did a video with Tom Haviland where they interviewed a couple of people who were said to be funeral directors or embalmers. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4c2e79-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html>https://rumble.com/v4c2e79-vsrf-live-113-embalmer-data-revealed.html</a>] Some guy who was presented as an embalmer named Bill said that he started seeing the calamari clots around July or August 2021: <span class="quote">"Prior to this - I mean, I've been an embalmer over 30 years - I had never ever seen this - prior to, I'm gonna say July or August of 2021."</span> [time 31:12] Kirsch also asked an embalmer called Lorin Ware <span class="quote">"And you started seeing them in mid-2021?"</span> But she answered <span class="quote">"Yes sir"</span>, and then Kirsch asked: <span class="quote">"Was it like a light switch turning on, or did it happen pretty gradually?"</span> And she answered that <span class="quote">"It was like a light switch turning on."</span> [time 26:00] But if everyone started suddenly seeing the clots in mid-2021 then how come no-one was speaking out about them until January 2022?</p>
<p>John O'Looney is a funeral director who was interviewed in the Died Suddenly film. During an interview in 2024 John Campbell asked John O'Looney when he first started seeing the new type of blood clots. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&t=10s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdRfbPrGIY&amp;t=10s</a>] Then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"So, really, in 2021, about halfway through, we started seeing lots and lots of people who were passing away suddenly, who were a lot younger than those that we were used to."</span> And a bit later O'Looney said this about the calamari clots: <span class="quote">"I've got a BIE-registered embalmer who works for me fulltime, who's done 22 years, and he's never seen them before, uh, 2021, no."</span> And then Campbell said: <span class="quote">"So some people have think they've seen some small ones in 2020, but that's not your experience: it's 2021 they started, midway through 2021."</span> And then O'Looney answered: <span class="quote">"Yes, 100%, yeah."</span></p>
<p>However I didn't find O'Looney mentioning the calamari clots anywhere in 2021. During an interview that he did on September 30th 2021, the only time he mentioned blood clots was when he said: <span class="quote">"Children will get cardio issues, inflammation of the heart. There will be blood clots and all the things I'm seeing as a funeral director. Now as a funeral director I'm seeing four main causes of death coming into me now.

And also in a video that O'Looney did in December 2021, he said: <span class="quote">"We used to see a blood clot very very rarely, but now I've seen more this year than I have in the previous 14."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/OTvtHkCNzlNE/</a>, time 0:58] But he didn't say anything about white fibrous clots even though he said he has seen a lot of clots. In another interview of O'Looney dated September 1st 2021, he didn't mention any kind of clots. [<a href=https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html>https://rumble.com/vlyri3-uk-funeral-director-seeing-alarming-rise-in-deaths.html</a>]</p>
<p>There were 16 tweets which matched the search phrase <code>from:olooneyjohn until:2021-12-31 clot</code> but none of them mentioned anything about white rubbery calamari clots.

[<a href=https://twitter.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1419982639415631873>https://twitter.com/OlooneyJohn/status/1419982639415631873</a>] Then O'Looney posted this comment: <span class="quote">"Just imagine having the ability to induce blood clots and vaccine recipients over Wi-Fi..."</span> However Reuters said this about the video: <span class="quote">"The circuit board was actually taken from a Virgin Media box for cable television - the casing of which can be seen on the bonnet of the van as the camera pans at the end of the footage. Virgin Media confirmed to Reuters it believed the circuit board had been taken from an old TV box, and the <span class="quote">'COV-19'</span> engraving was not authentic."</span> [<a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/>https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22R35E/</a>] So it might be that the people who made the video even left the casing of the box visible so the video would be easier to debunk.</p>
<p>Many anti-vaxxers on Twitter suspect O'Looney of being controlled opposition who is attempting to discredit anti-vaxxers: [<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1804717634270978122>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1804717634270978122</a>]</p>

<p>Richard Hirschman posted a video on Twitter with this description: <span class="quote">"This is a video of me removing one of the strange white fibrous clots, from the right jugular vein. The person who was recording it is Nicky King, who is also an embalmer. I didn't notice it until I lifted the vessel up. I could feel it inside the vein. I only show this because people still don't believe it and ask for video evidence. What's causing this? I can't say for sure, but I didn't start seeing this until early 2021. Unfortunately, I still find strange clotting in several bodies that I embalm."</span> [<a href=https://twitter.com/r_hirschman/status/1759337235042758748>https://twitter.com/r_hirschman/status/1759337235042758748</a>] However the video looked like a carotid endarterectomy where atherosclerotic plague was removed from the carotid artery (or maybe a jugular vein which runs next to the carotid artery). [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_endarterectomy>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_endarterectomy</a>] Carotid plaques have a similar light yellowish color as the supposed calamari clots.</p>
<p>Richard Hirschman was the main star of the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> film by Stew Peters. The main theme of the film were the long fibrous clots that were allegedly found by embalmers and funeral directors. The credits of the <span class="quote">"Watch the Water"</span> film say that the film was written, produced, directed, filmed, and edited by Matthew Miller Skow and Nicholas Stumphauzer.

So basically the Died Suddenly film was a sequel to a film which claimed that COVID was caused by snake venom in tap water.</p>
<p>The Died Suddenly film also includes a video of basketball player Keyontae Johnson collapsing, but he collapsed on December 12th 2020.

Shurka says that he was chosen to be a messenger of the TLS and that his mentor Ray is a member of the TLS. There's two books that were published under Shurka's name but that were supposedly written by Ray. Both books are supposed to have been originally written in Hebrew, and in the other book called <span class="quote">"The Pyramid Code"</span>, Ray said that he was taken to an extraterrestiral planet called Nashia by Rabbi AA who is <span class="quote">"a 424-year-old human being with immense spiritual and supernatural abilities"</span>.

<p>The description of one episode of the Jane Ruby Show said: <span class="quote">"On today's Dr. Jane Ruby Show, Dr. Jane interviews Counter-bioterrorism expert Dr. Tau Braun who explains that self-replicating nanoparticles in the C19 shots are programmed to grow venom ducts inside the human body. His theory is that the jabbed are growing live venom gland cells and other animal structures. Dr. Jane shows you the DOJ's research using cone snail venom to make huge amounts of deadly synthetic conotoxins. They say that deep ocean cone snail venom is a serious threat to humans who never dive that deep!"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v54l80n-the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts.html>https://rumble.com/v54l80n-the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts.html</a>] At time 8:50 when Jane Ruby introduced Tau Braun, she said: <span class="quote">"He has worked with many of the experts you have already seen on the Jane Ruby Show, like Sasha Latypova of Team Enigma, Bryan Ardis, and so many more."</span> (How come Latypova has worked together with so many ridiculous people who are connected to Stew Peters, like Tau Braun, David Nixon, and Shimon Yanowitz?) During the interview Tau Braun said that people were wondering if COVID jabs contain snake venom or if they contain graphene oxide, but he said they contain both because the graphene oxide acts as a delivery mechanism for the snake venom. At time 13:18, he said: <span class="quote">"How do you get venom into the body and how do you keep it stable? You add graphene oxide."</span> At time 40:33, Tau Braun said that the calamari clots consist of tissue which contains snake venom ducts: <span class="quote">"Those monstrous clot-looking things are literally tissue that has grown a duct - and specialized ducts - the closest match I found to these fibrotic clots today is the chameleon tongue - it's the long, very very - extremely - it has what's called the tensile strength, it has elasticity to it. But it's extremely strong. Cause it has to whip out like a whip and it has to come back in, and so it has to have expansion at rapid speed, and it has to be able to go back. So it's like elastic."</span> At time 17:40, Tau Braun said that if there is a species of snake that eats rodents, then the snake won't produce venom which affects amphibians but only venom which affects rodents, and then he said that in the same way the snake venom in the COVID vaccines was designed to not affect Aryans because the COVID jabs are a race-specific bioweapon that was created by the Fourth Reich: <span class="quote">"So why are certain people totally fine from this? I'm gonna tell you that this was built by the Fourth Reich, and I'm gonna tell you that Aryans are not having a problem with this vaccine. I'm gonna tell you that you can stick this into an Aryan over and over... and what I mean by Aryan? I mean people that originally came from Viking heritage, Germanic heritage, and that basically you can go and look at those principles of what Nazis believe the superior race to be. And I'm gonna tell you this weapon was not built for them."</span> Tau Braun later also said that the Aryans were planning to kill off nine tenths of humanity. Tau Braun looks like a Middle Easterner, and he seems like a Jew based on some of his posts about Jews on social media, because for example in December 2020 he published a Facebook post which featured a photo of a Jewish passover plate and which included the following text: <span class="quote">"Fun fact the Passover Plate (built for plague in Egypt) has everything on it for Covid Prevention [...] Charoset - a sweet, dark-colored paste made of fruits and nuts - Egyptian Jews make it from dates, raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and sweet wine. [...] Said in yiddish voice, <span class="quote">'And vee need Pfizer?

[<a href=https://www.drtaubraun.com/about>https://www.drtaubraun.com/about</a>] So it's interesting that he has a background in emergency management like Celeste Solum and Cyrus Parsa.</p>
<p>During Jane Ruby's interview with Tau Braun, she also mentioned that she was friends in DC with someone who used to work in intelligence: <span class="quote">"I had a friend in DC - we went out to - you know, he was intelligence under the Reagan thing - but he was very, former intelligence."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v54l80n-the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts.html?start=1205>https://rumble.com/v54l80n-the-jabbed-are-growing-animal-venom-glands-and-ducts.html?start=1205</a>] Until 2020 Jane Ruby used to live in DC, which is where the headquarters of CIA, FBI, NSA, and ONI are located.</p>
<p>I believe the story that COVID vaccines contain hydras was first presented by Carrie Madej on the Stew Peters Show in September 2021.

<p>Ariana Love was one of the main people who was pushing the story that COVID jabs contain an octopus-like creature called <em>Hydra vulgaris</em>. In December 2022 Ariana Love also appeared on the Stew Peters Show saying that PCR tests are used to clone humans: <span class="quote">"Love claimed that <span class="quote">'PCR kits have never been about testing for COVID [...] They're cloning devices'</span>. To support her claim, Love cited a study from 2015 by Hoseini and Sauer titled 'Molecular cloning using polymerase chain reaction, an educational guide for cellular engineering'[1]. Love's reasoning is that the article described the use of PCR to perform molecular cloning. Given that COVID-19 detection kits used on humans also rely on PCR, she concluded that the kits must be human cloning devices."</span> [<a href=https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/pcr-covid-19-tests-arent-cloning-devices-dont-modify-human-genome-ariyana-love-stew-peters/>https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/pcr-covid-19-tests-arent-cloning-devices-dont-modify-human-genome-ariyana-love-stew-peters/</a>, <a href=https://rumble.com/v1gh8dp-patent-pcr-test-linked-to-human-cloning-video-shows-animal-experiments-cros.html>https://rumble.com/v1gh8dp-patent-pcr-test-linked-to-human-cloning-video-shows-animal-experiments-cros.html</a>] In an interview with Age of Truth TV, Ariana Love said that there's a Galactic Federation of 82 species of aliens, and that the above the Galactic Federation is the Universal Council: <span class="quote">"They're okay - I think that they were were white hats working with the Galactic Federation, if you ask me. And I do believe there are benign forces in the universe, um, there is even a higher hierarchy above the Galactic Federation, which is called the Universal Council, and these are geneticists. They populate worlds. The galactic federation is like a police force. They're interested in using their technologies to save species on worlds that are being attacked and subjugated by the fallen. [...] Yes. And earth is one of them. We're the 83rd. [...] There were 82 species - even Paul Hellyer talked about this - there's there's 82 species in the Galactic Federation - earth is the 83rd - and I believe the Pleiadians are part of it too."</span> [<a href=https://ageoftruth.tv/new-live-stream-19-dec-2021-the-love-doctor-the-devils-alien-monster/>https://ageoftruth.tv/new-live-stream-19-dec-2021-the-love-doctor-the-devils-alien-monster/</a>, time 55:00] There seems to be a lot of crossover between the Stew Peters Network and the various operations of Reiner Füllmich, because Ariana Love also gave an hour-long presentation about graphene oxide to Füllmich's Corona Investigative Committee.

<p>In 2021, La Quinta Columna published videos where they said that vaccinated parents had <span class="quote">"pandemic babies"</span> who appeared to have completely or almost completely black eyes, and the babies were also developing rapidly so that they were able to walk when they were 3 months old or crawl when they were 2 weeks old. [<a href=https://www.orwell.city/2021/09/black-eyed-babies.html>https://www.orwell.city/2021/09/black-eyed-babies.html</a>] The videos were typical of Stew ops in the sense that they had high visual shock value so they could be easily conveyed to low-IQ people through images or short video clips, just like the stories about the calamari clots, vaccinated people being magnetic, self-assembling structures found under the microscope, and Melissa McAtee's story that vaccine vials glowed in the dark because they contained luciferase:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-blackeyed.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>Apart from the black-eyed-babies, another forgotten episode in COVID history is that in 2021 La Quinta Columna was saying that vaccinated women had black period blood that contained black clots. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/WGjJ2rgw14N9/</a>] First a guy from La Quinta Columna said that they had received a letter from their viewer which said: <span class="quote">"Dr. Sevillano, does the Moderna vaccine cause irregular periods and black bleeding clots? My 17-year-old daughter was given a dose of that poison, and now she's with bleeding out of the normal cycle, with black blood and black clots. It's been two months since she was vaccinated. Thank you, and go ahead. We are all La Quinta Columna. I know it."</span> And then the guy from La Quinta Columna answered that it was correct and the symptoms were caused by the vaccine. But for some reason the story about the white calamari clots seems to have stuck but everyone forgot about the black clots:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-black-period.jpg width=200>
</div>
<p>Another forgotten episode is that in 2021 before the story about the calamari clots had been rolled out, Carrie Madej was saying that vaccinated people were growing hydra clots (which makes it seem like they were generating new stories by just combining concepts selected by a random generator): [<a href=https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/>https://ambassadorlove.blog/2021/11/01/transgenic-hydras-parasites-a-biological-weapons-system-for-rapid-human-cloning/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-hydraclots.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Carrie Madej told Stew that the clots might actually consist of hydras: <span class="quote">"Let's just look at these water parasites. These things have the potential to grow, and be innumerable, right. If you're growing things, it has the potential to clog your arteries, it can clog capillaries, it can clog lymphatics. So we see blood clotting happening, and plus the body's response to having an infection, or a parasitic invasion, right, would be an inflammatory response, would be to have inflammation, which perhaps clotting an area."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/CU7FTZwr54yP/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/CU7FTZwr54yP/</a>, time 12:12] And then the video cut off to the photo of the clot above, and Madej said: <span class="quote">"So, they're pulling clots sometimes out too that's almost as big as my hand, you know, has finger-like extensions coming from let's say the heart."</span> (I think during the interview Carrie Madej didn't actually say that the clot in the photo came from a heart or that it came from an <span class="quote">"early teen"</span>, but I don't know if she said it somewhere else or if it's something that Ariana Love made up. And the photo of the clot wasn't necessarily even provided by Madej but Stew's production crew could've just inserted it into the video as an example of a blood clot.)</p>
<p>When I searched Google Images for <span class="quote">"bronchial cast"</span>, the image that was shown during Carrie Madej's interview with Stew was one of the top results, complete with the arrows. But the article with the image was published in 2018: [<a href=https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/>https://empr.com/home/news/heart-failure-patient-coughs-up-bronchial-tree-shaped-blood-clot/</a>]</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The standard Stew op is that strange objects are found in COVID vaccines or in the blod of vaccinated people. One time Stew Peters wrote on Gettr that COVID vaccines contained gorilla feces and Neanderthal DNA. The Gettr post included a video of the FEMA whistleblower Celeste Solumn, who I believe was the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel long before the vaccines had even been rolled out: [<a href=https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7>https://gettr.com/post/p2rc1em2ae7</a>]</p>

<p>When I searched Twitter for references to Jane Ruby in the early days of COVID, I found a link to an article by Jane Ruby from April 2020 where she wrote that she had to cancel a dinner with Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago because she had caught COVID.

<blockquote>
<p>Cambridge Analytica was used semi-legally in USA (after consulting with Rudi Giullliani's law firm) and had a campaign that flooded swing states and middle America with sock puppet accounts spewing bile, fake stories designed to outrage and videos showing France and Germany under Sharia law. Many of these videos were produced or shared by Gatestone Media which also provides content for Rebel Media. John Bolton sits on the board Gatestone Media. He was the architect of the war on terror and now the National Security Advisor. The main owner of Gatestone is Nina Rosenwald who is the heiress to Sears. Nina Rosenwald was, in 2003, a recipient of the Louis Brandeis Award, given by the Zionist Organization of America for her pro-Israel advocacy. Rebecca Mercer also helps fund Gatestone Media via her family foundation. Funding for Gatestone also comes from the MEF (Middle East Forum) a hard line, conservative pro-Israel think tank.</p>
<p>Robert Mercer also finances Rebel Media. Rebel media employs Tommy Robinson, Lauren Southern and Laura Loomer all of whom are right wing antagonists that are scant with the facts. Most of these people have at some point been promoted by Breitbart or Infowars.</p>
<p>Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley Lennon, Paul Harris - see the article below) and James O Keefe also receive funding via the David Horowitz Freedom Center which is financed by Robert Shillman who is a board member for Friends of Israel's Defence Forces. Robert Shillman also provides funding for Rebel Media. Nina Rosenwald, the heiress to Sears, also funds James O Keefe and Project Veritas. Geert Wilders, the Dutch far right antagonist is also financed by the David Horowitz Freedom Centre. The MEF helps fund Tommy Robinsons legal team (he is currently in jail for breach of bail conditions - he jeopardised a trial by filming the defendants specifically against court orders). According to MEF, the organisation is also <span class="quote">"sponsoring and organising the second <span class="quote">'Free Tommy Robinson'</span> gathering in London on July 14"</span>. The statement was signed by MEF Director Gregg Roman, who has previously <span class="quote">"worked in Israel's Defence and Foreign Ministries"</span>.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Robert Mercer invested in Breitbart with money from his own personal fortune and some from the Koch Brothers, via an investment arm called G.A.I. G.A.I was ran by Mercer ally and ex Goldman Sachs exec Steve Bannon, whose films Mercer has also financed. Steve Bannon goes on to become chief editor of Breitbart when Andrew Breitbart dies and later campaign manager and a top aide to President Trump. Mercer is the main financier of Breitbart.</p>

<p>In 2017 Laura Loomer started a <span class="quote">"Free Laura"</span> campaign after she was arrested for interrupting an anti-Trump stage play.

Her book was named after a speech by Breitbart, and she dedicated her book to the media warriors who were following the path laid by Andrew Breitbart.

<p>George Webb is another citizen journalist who used to live in DC, but he also self-published a book about citizen journalism called <span class="quote">"Citizen Journalism &amp; Public Intelligence: How To Tell Your Story"</span>. George Webb was first introduced to his former sidekick Jason Goodman by Lee Stranahan, who was a protege of Andrew Breitbart.

<p>After the former police chief Alan Hostetter was charged because of his involvement in the Capitol Riot, he filed a motion to dismiss where he said that January 6th was a COINTELPRO operation and that he was set up by an operation that included Robert Shillman.

The people at the meeting also included Robert Shillman, who Hostetter described as a <span class="quote">"multi-billionaire who made his fortune in the tech industry"</span> who <span class="quote">"portrayed himself as someone who was always looking for worthy non-profits to support and could be helpful in funding efforts to resist the oppressive Covid lockdowns and other actions being take at the state and local level"</span>.

<p>Latypova's daughter Soph used to have a YouTube channel with almost a million subscribers, but after her channel got deleted, her show was hosted at CENSORED.TV from 2019 until January 2023. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230203044238/https://censored.tv/watch/show/soph>http://web.archive.org/web/20230203044238/https://censored.tv/watch/show/soph</a>] CENSORED.TV is the platform of Gavin McInnes, who was the founder of Proud Boys and a co-founder of Vice Media. McInnes used to work for Rebel Media which Ezra Levant called <span class="quote">"my Zionist company"</span>.

<p>In 2017 when McInnes was a guest on InfoWars, he sat in a studio where there was an image mounted on the wall that looked like a rainbow-colored Star of David placed over a rainbow flag (where the flag had six colors like the gay flag and not seven colors like the Noahide flag): [<a href=https://i.imgur.com/Sb35SXc.png>https://i.imgur.com/Sb35SXc.png</a>, <a href=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9UoBRJXEAAeQ82?format=jpg>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9UoBRJXEAAeQ82?format=jpg</a>]</p>

<p>I don't know if McInnes was sitting at his own studios or the studios of InfoWars. But I don't think the screenshots are photoshopped, because I found two different screenshots which both displayed the same image mounted on the wall, and when I searched for the other screenshot on TinEye, I found a third screenshot which was hosted at YouTube because it was used as the thumbnail of a YouTube video, which was probaby a video uploaded by Prison Planet TV because the image was indexed from a page which featured other videos by Prison Planet TV.

</h2>
<p>In January 2022 when Yeadon did a presentation about Team Enigma's findings for Füllmich's committee, he said: <span class="quote">"As an undergraduate, I worked under military clearance at Porton Down. That's the equivalent of Fort Detrick, it's where the UK military develops its so-called chemical defences. So I was under the Official Secrets Act. They must have thought I wasn't a crazy person at the time. I also worked for six months at the Police Forensic Service headquarters at Aldermaston, so I learned a lot of analytical techniques in that time."</span> [<a href=https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en?t=135>https://odysee.com/%40Corona-Investigative-Committee/Mike-Session-86-en?t=135</a>, <a href=https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies>https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dr-mike-yeadons-key-testimony-part-i-the-eight-covid-lies</a>] In an expert testimony that Mike Yeadon provided for America's Frontline Doctors, he wrote: <span class="quote">"I have had Government security clearance and worked placements at top-secret facilities at Porton Down (Chemical Defence Establishment) and Aldermaston (Forensic Science Service HQ)."</span> [<a href=https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AFLDS-v-UC-9th-Circuit-Writ-Filed-1.pdf>https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AFLDS-v-UC-9th-Circuit-Writ-Filed-1.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>In an open letter in 2024, Mike Yeadon wrote: <span class="quote">"Part of my undergraduate training involved research placements at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down, Wiltshire, where I was a small cog in the long term development of injected antidotes for nerve gas poisoning to protect British troops."</span> [<a href=https://www.muftisays.com/forums/96-covid19/14893-open-letter-from-mike-yeadon-to-metropolitan-police.html>https://www.muftisays.com/forums/96-covid19/14893-open-letter-from-mike-yeadon-to-metropolitan-police.html</a>] But I don't know if it was just a cover story that he was developing antidotes against nerve agents, like how bioweapon developers are always saying that they are developing vaccines against viruses or they are trying to prevent the next pandemic.</p>
<p>It might be that Yeadon only worked at Porton Down for a short time as a college student, but if he already had a military clearance when he was a college student, it increases the likelihood that he was later also involved in other kinds of work which required a security clearance, or that he was recruited to be part of some intelligence network when he was in college.</p>

<p>Nick Redfern wrote that Porton Down was home to experiments where British military personnel were unwittingly subjected to LSD in the 1950s, and also wrote that the Rendelsham Forest UFO incident may have been a psychological operation that was staged by people from Porton Down, who subjected the witnesses of the incident to psychoactive drugs. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcqiF3NhXdg&t=11m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcqiF3NhXdg&amp;t=11m54s</a>, <a href=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2022/12/The-Rendlesham-Forest-UFO-Incident-s-Some-of-the-Top-Secret-Lesser-known-Parts-of-the-Story/>https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2022/12/The-Rendlesham-Forest-UFO-Incident-s-Some-of-the-Top-Secret-Lesser-known-Parts-of-the-Story/</a>] He also wrote the following about another UFO incident that involved Porton Down: <span class="quote">"On the night of January 23, 1974, an enigmatic event occurred in the large Berwyn Mountain range in North Wales, United Kingdom, that, for some within the UFO research community, has come to be known as the British Roswell. Researcher Andy Roberts summed up this mysterious affair: <span class="quote">'The claim was that a UFO piloted by extraterrestrials crashed, or was shot down, on the mountain known as Cader Berwyn and that the alien crew, some still alive, were whisked off to a secret military installation in the south of England for study.'</span> That secret military installation was said to be none other than Porton Down."</span> [<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=g91EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT159>https://books.google.com/books?id=g91EDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159</a>] So I wonder if Porton Down is also home to work in psychological operations in addition to research on chemical and biological weapons.</p>

<p>Norman Fenton and Martin Neil have done work for the British defense and intelligence agency DSTL, whose headquarters are located in Porton Down.

The main product of Fenton and Neil's company is the AgenaRisk software, which was originally developed under the name MODIST, but the lead partner of the MODIST project was QinetiQ, and the MODIST project was managed by David Milledge from QinetiQ.

<p>In 2012 Jane Ruby was employed as medical affairs manager for the pharmaceutical company Individor whose products included a alternative to Subutex called Subuxone. She falsified data about Subuxone which led to their CEO being criminally convicted: [<a href=https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2021/alj-cr5928/index.html>https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2021/alj-cr5928/index.html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case involves a company's effort to have one of its drugs covered by the Medicaid program. To achieve this goal, a company executive deliberately submitted false information to MassHealth, the Massachusetts Medicaid agency. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, Petitioner, as the company's chief executive officer, was held criminally accountable for the offense.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>On or about October 10, 2012, RADARS gave Dr. Ruby the Massachusetts-specific analysis, but the results were not what she had expected or hoped for. They showed that, among the three categories of drugs (Suboxone Film, Suboxone Tablet, and buprenorphine-only tablets, like Subutex Tablet), the buprenorphine-only tablets had the lowest rate of unintended pediatric exposure. (1.8 exposures per 10, 000 units versus 2.7 exposures for Suboxone Film and 3.3 exposures for Suboxone Tablet). IG Ex. 2 at 7 (Information ¶ 25).[8]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby did not give Dr. Jeffrey an accurate version of the RADARS analysis. Instead, she manipulated the data by adding the two tablet rates together in order to show that Suboxone Film had the lowest rate of unintentional pediatric exposure in Massachusetts, when, in fact, it did not. On or about October 16, 2012, she emailed the false data to MassHealth, claiming, also falsely, that she had received the calculations from RADARS. She forwarded a copy of her email to Indivior's global medical director. IG Ex. 2 at 7-8 (Information ¶ 27).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Dr. Ruby subsequently received additional data on unintended pediatric exposures; it showed that Suboxone Film <em>did not have the lowest rate</em> of unintended pediatric exposure in Massachusetts. She did not provide that data to MassHealth, telling other Indivior employees (although not Petitioner) that her rationale for withholding the additional data was <span class="quote">"don't ask, don't tell."</span> IG Ex. 2 at 9 (Information ¶ 29).[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020 it was announced that the case resulted in a 600 million USD penalty to Individor: [<a href=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525759-indivior-hit-with-600-million-in-civil-and-criminal-penalties-over/>https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525759-indivior-hit-with-600-million-in-civil-and-criminal-penalties-over/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drugmaker Indivior Solutions will pay $600 million in criminal and civil liability over its marketing of opioid-addiction treatment Suboxone, the Justice Department (DOJ) announced.</p>
<p>Indivior pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor in July for making false statements to Massachusetts's Medicaid program, MassHealth, in order to expand access to the drug for children.</p>
<p>Of the $600 million, the company was sentenced to pay $289 million in criminal penalties Wednesday, according to the DOJ.</p>

<p>The Exceptional Concervative Network was a black conservative media outlet based in DC. It now seems to be defunct, and the newest video on TECN's YouTube channel is from 2023. Many of their newest videos were advertisements for New Tang Dynasty TV. [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/&#x40;Theexceptionalconservativeshow/videos>https://www.youtube.com/@Theexceptionalconservativeshow/videos</a>] TECN's website also had a banner at the top that linked to NTD.tv.

<p>Paul Cottrell and Leo Zagami used to both have radio shows on Global Enlightenment Radio Network, which was run by a black guy from DC called Darrel Neely, whose LinkedIn profile says that he worked as an intelligence specialist for the US Navy. [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dfneely/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/dfneely/</a>] I didn't find evidence of McClenton having an intelligence background, but nevertheless it's safe to be suspicious of media outlets that are based in DC.</p>
<p>One of the people who had a show on TECN was Randy Purham. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20201005110526/https://theexceptionalconservativeshow.com/tecn%C2%AE-tv>http://web.archive.org/web/20201005110526/https://theexceptionalconservativeshow.com/tecn%C2%AE-tv</a>] His LinkedIn bio says that from 1998 to 2020, he worked in Washington DC for the US Army as <span class="quote">"a subject matter expert in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense, protection, offense, and non-proliferation"</span> (but he seems to have worked at several locations apart from DC over the period, so perhaps he picked DC as the location in case he only needed to pick a single location for the whole period). [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpurham/details/experience/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpurham/details/experience/</a>] His bio also says that while he served as a CBRN squad leader in Germany, he gained experience in areas including intelligence operations. The period when he worked for the Army overlaps with the period when he had a show on TECN.</p>
<p>In 2022 Randy Purham was a speaker at a Voices Against Trafficking conference that was livestreamed by NTD and Epoch Times.

<p>In 2020 when Jane Ruby interviewed Alan Dershowitz on her show on TECN, she told him: <span class="quote">"You are probably the greatest defender of civil liberties due process and free speech that we've ever had in American history."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0G6qI4LHEo&10m54s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0G6qI4LHEo&amp;10m54s</a>] Dershowitz was the lawyer who got Epstein his sweetheart deal in 2008, and he also served as a legal consultant for Harvey Weinstein. Jane Ruby also posted a tweet about how Dershowitz said that Epstein was not a trafficker and not working for Mossad.

</h2>
<p>When Karen Kingston first appeared in alt media, she was presented as a Pfizer whistleblower whose big revelation was that COVID vaccines contained graphene oxide and hydrogel. In 2023 Latypova also started saying that dental anesthetic contained hydrogel. So I tried searching for early tweets about the story that COVID vaccines contained hydrogel to see who mentioned it first. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel%20vaccines%20until%3A2020-7-1&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel%20vaccines%20until%3A2020-7-1&amp;f=live</a>]</p>
<p>The earliest tweet I found was a tweet from March 2020 which said: <span class="quote">"I am more concerned about <span class="quote">'DARPA Deployment of Hydrogel'</span> vaccines. (Celeste Solum) yt"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/CYNDI12365/status/1241612603681648641>https://x.com/CYNDI12365/status/1241612603681648641</a>] The second-earliest tweet linked to a video by Celeste Solum that was mirrored on YouTube by the flat earther Jamie Lee (aplanetruth 4u). [<a href=https://x.com/Jrnyman2/status/1249020763929223170>https://x.com/Jrnyman2/status/1249020763929223170</a>, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200407191851/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqTRRm_ffog>http://web.archive.org/web/20200407191851/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqTRRm_ffog</a>] Many other early tweets also linked to YouTube videos by Celeste Solum, so she seems to have been the first person who was talking about hydrogel in connection with COVID vaccines that became popular enough that it was mentioned multiple times on Twitter. Celeste specifically also said that hydrogel was a DARPA technology, in the same way Carrie Madej later started saying that vaccines were going to contain <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span>.</p>
<p>The earliest tweets that matched the phrase <span class="quote">"DARPA hydrogel"</span> were posted in March to April 2020, and I believe they all referred to videos by Celeste Solum: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-5-1+%22darpa+hydrogel%22&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-5-1+%22darpa+hydrogel%22&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>In April 2020 June Knight from WATB TV wrote an article about hydrogel, where she referred to videos by Celeste Solum as her source. [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928223834/https://watb.tv/darpa-hydrogel-sensor/>https://web.archive.org/web/20200928223834/https://watb.tv/darpa-hydrogel-sensor/</a>]</p>
<p>In an interview with Andrew Kaufman in May 2020, Max Igan said: <span class="quote">"Hydrogel is a - it's a nanosubstance, it's developed by DARPA - which is able to fuse with your cells, literally fuse with your cells. It goes in and it interfaces with your cells and becomes part of you. And it can be read - signals - to and from - it's like an interface into -. There's actually a report that's been put out recently by a lady called Celeste Solum. She's quite religious, I mean God bless her, she's quite religious, so the last part of the talk is - last ten minutes is quite religious. But she's a great researcher. Apparently she used to work in one of these weapons development places. And she's a bit of an insider. And she's been reporting on hydrogel. I'll send you a link after the talk, I'd be interested in you having a look at that. And uh, because of the possibility of this actually being in the vaccines, you know, this particular nano-stuff that DARPA's been working on -. And by the way, this is - they've been still working on this while the lockdown's in place. You know, when you think about it, only essential services are functioning, and the development of this hydrogel by DARPA is seen as an essential service for national security. And with the separation of the children - programming people to be separated, everyone be separated, everyone 1.5 minutes apart, 2 minutes apart over time. Forget about having children anymore. They want all the next generation of children to be - I would suggest - vaccinated with this hydrogel, and interface into the matrix, part of the AI machine, as soon as they're born, and keep them all separated from each other. So basically the response to this <span class="quote">'COVID-19'</span> is to remove every aspect of humanity from humankind, keep everybody completely separated, and make everyone - you know, fit them into this interface - into the machine, whether they want it or not. Um, I'd be really interested on you looking into that, and seeing how they may be incorporating that into the vaccines. Cause what you're saying about them modifying DNA: it fits in perfectly with what hydrogel can actually do. And there's some papers on it, some DARPA papers you can actually go look at. I'll send you some links after the talk."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/Mg1GT_URHu8/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/Mg1GT_URHu8/</a>, time 19:00] I believe the first four people in alt media who interviewed Kaufman were all flat earthers, and the first one of them was James True who also livestreamed Kaufman's first viral presentation, who called himself Kaufman's lead writer, and who said that he had emptied his Patreon account on producing, editing, and advertising Kafuman's videos. Kaufman now says that the earth is flat himself. In January 2020 Max Igan also did a video where he said that the earth was flat, but a few days later he said that he had some kind of a breakdown because he was being targeted with mind control technology and he doesn't actually believe in flat earth. However earlier in 2016 Max Igan did a video of his flight from Chile to Australia, where he supposedly set out to disprove the flat earth model by tracking the direction of his compass during the flight, but he ended up finding that the compass pointed to a direction that was consistent with a flat earth model, which was then used as evidence that the earth was flat by Globebusters and Jeranism (so I think Igan staged a fake video in order hoax to prop up the flat earth theory). Andrew Kaufman's <span class="quote">"Hippocratic Hypocrisy"</span> film was produced and narrated by the flat earth channel Spacebusters, but the only way in which the film featured Kaufman was that it featured clips of his interview with Max Igan.</p>
<p>In a YouTube video in May 2020, Steven Ben-Nun from Israeli News Live said: <span class="quote">"We've got a neighbor, she's been - her daughter - excuse me, her mother is already caught on what's going on. Her eyes are wide open. She realizes the danger of what's going on, the dangers of this vaccine, et cetera. The DARPA - and of course the hydrogel - the hydrogel that will actually infuse into your DNA - very, very nasty stuff. And I got to kind of hold my tongue on this, because on Israeli News Live we shouldn't be going into all these details here, have to save that for Patreon - but let me just tell you this: the neighbor shared with us - she took her son in to the doctor just recently, he has asthma so he's always having trouble with - over this asthmatic related issues there - and her doctor today warmed her to be very cautious when it comes to the vaccine, and don't take it. By the way they will put up their chip - yes, you got that right - but it's not just any kind of chip. When you're dealing with hydrogel, you're talking about infusing it into your DNA."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zomnoTTlRy0&t=6m15s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zomnoTTlRy0&amp;t=6m15s</a>] Ben-Nun used to do many videos together with Celeste Solum, so he may have heard about hydrogel from her but he lied that he heard about it from his neighbor, or maybe both Celeste and Ben-Nun were told by their handlers to start talking about hydrogel. In 2020 Ben-Nun and his friend John Moore were saying that Planet-X would pass by the earth in 2021 which would cause most humans to die, and Ben-Nun was showing screenshots of emails about Planet-X that he supposedly received from an unnamed source from NASA. John Moore says that he is a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. government, and Ben-Nun has also called himself a former CIA agent.</p>
<p>I found no COVID-related tweets that mentioned Carrie Madej until July 2020 when a video by her went viral. [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-7-7%20carrie%20madej&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-7-7%20carrie%20madej&amp;f=live</a>] One of the topics she discussed in the video was hydrogel. She said: <span class="quote">"DARPA founded a company that produces soft flexible hydrogels - I've mentioned hydrogels in the past - injected beneath the skin to perform health monitoring. They sync to a smartphone app to give the user immediate health insights. However hydrogel nanotechnology grows and spreads in the body once implanted. We do not know how this affects our DNA. We know that it can send information directly and continuously to an artificial intelligence. Ok, so all of us have a smartphone, mine included, we have health apps. One way or another it's on your phone. Sometimes you have to look under a Google app, whatever, it's there. You can disable it but you can't erase it. It's impossible. This is a COVID-19 apps they're putting it into has to do with this. They're getting you set up. You have an app, you have a software. Now all you need is this little hydrogel that's put there. And then forever, everything in your body is monitored. For a woman, your ovulation, when you menstruate, how many times you've had sex - for a man how many times you have had sex - how much alcohol content's in your body, your vitamins and minerals, if you've fallen down, how many steps you're taking, if you're anxious, your emotions and your sleep, everything about you, continuously."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/cfE4DcT62CO6/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/cfE4DcT62CO6/</a>, time 17:38] In October 2021 I believe Carrie Madej became the first person who started to say that COVID vaccines contained hydras, but more than a year earlier she already said COVID vaccines were going to contain hydrogel.</p>
<p>In September 2020 Makia Freeman wrote an article about how COVID vaccines were going to contain DARPA hydrogel. [<a href=https://thefreedomarticles.com/hydrogel-biosensor-darpa-gates-implantable-nanotech-covid-vaccine/>https://thefreedomarticles.com/hydrogel-biosensor-darpa-gates-implantable-nanotech-covid-vaccine/</a>] Freeman has written many articles for David Icke's website. I believe David Icke first started saying that the coronavirus does not exist on April 6th 2020 UTC when he was interviewed by London Real, but 5 days before it Icke's website published an article about the no-virus theory by Makia Freeman.

<p>The earliest tweet I found which said that dental anesthetic contained DARPA hydrogel was posted in February 2023 by a Qtard account, and it said: <span class="quote">"Jane Ruby and attorney Todd Callender confirm that ALL INJECTABLES contain DARPA HYDROGEL, flue shots , vxxxines and even dental anesthesia ...."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=hydrogel+dental+until%3A2023-12-12&amp;f=live</a>] The first tweet I found which said that dental anesthetic contained graphene oxide was posted in August 2022, and it linked to a video by La Quinta Columna: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=dental+anesthetic+graphene+until%3A2023-3-3&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=dental+anesthetic+graphene+until%3A2023-3-3&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>In December 2021, Sutoova, her father Stefan Suto and her husband Steve Bennun all developed symptoms of COVID-19, although none tested positive for it at the time.</p>
<p>Eighteen days after battling a fever, Suto would be dead in a hotel room in Florida.</p>
<p>Not from sickness, but rather hemolytic anemia due to toxicities of inhaled and intravenous hydrogen peroxide, according to an independent autopsy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Johnson also criticized the family for not taking Suto to the hospital.</p>
<p>Sutoova said at the time, her family had been told by doctors in the medical freedom movement that the COVID procedures in hospitals were killing people.</p>
<p>Johnson also pointed out a recent episode of the family's YouTube channel, in which Bennun explored the flat earth theory, citing it as a reason he would be a <span class="quote">"problematic witness"</span> to a potential jury.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"The (district attorney) is ultimately saying, <span class="quote">'Look, we think you're conspiracy theorists. You should have known what you were doing was nuts,'</span>"</span> asked WSMV4 Investigates.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"There was such a division in the medical community, had literally thousands of doctors that went what they called anti-vax,"</span> Bennun said.</p>
<p>Bennun said along with Madej, the alternative medicine doctors in Florida who continued the hydrogen peroxide treatment stopped speaking with the family.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"They all turned their backs on us. That really began to cause us to question this movement and what their real motives were behind it,"</span> Bennun said.</p>

<p>After Carrie Madej was sued, she took the sovereign citizenship route and claimed that she was not Carrie Madej, but rather she was Freewoman CarrieLynnBeneficiary so she was above the law: [<a href=https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1942779410425294968>https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1942779410425294968</a>, <a href=http://www.the-sidebar.com/2023/04/exclusive-notorious-anti-vax-doctor.html>http://www.the-sidebar.com/2023/04/exclusive-notorious-anti-vax-doctor.html</a>]</p>

<p>She was given multiple, clear opportunities to challenge the claims against her in court for the next 2 and a half years. A judge reviewed the evidence and came to the conclusion that Madej committed intentional and egregious actions that killed my grandfather.</p>

<h2>
<a href=#Project_Veritas_whistleblower_Justin_Leslie id=Project_Veritas_whistleblower_Justin_Leslie>Project Veritas whistleblower Justin Leslie</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2024 Justin Leslie came out as a whistleblower who said that Project Veritas was controlled opposition and that James O'Keefe had attended Bohemian Grove. He is supposed to have briefly worked for Pfizer as a <span class="quote">"formulation analytical scientist"</span>. He was meant to appear on Project Veritas as a Pfizer whistleblower like their earlier Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee, but O'Keefe never published his story. However he still did other work for Project Veritas, and he was the undercover operative who recorded his gay date with the mulatto Pfizer employee Jordon Walker (which was such a big hit for O'Keefe that he has now churned out around ten more videos with a similar yellow filter and a similar camera angle).</p>
<p>However Justin Leslie is probably about as genuine as other whistleblowers on Project Veritas, because he claims he gave Carrie Madej a vaccine vial which contained hydras, and he says that virology is a pseudoscience: [<a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/documentary-indicates-james-okeefe-attended-bohemian-grove-suggests-hes-a-cia-asset>https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/documentary-indicates-james-okeefe-attended-bohemian-grove-suggests-hes-a-cia-asset</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After graduating from the University of Rhode Island in the spring of 2020 with a bachelor's degree in pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences, documentary producer Justin Leslie states he entered a biomedical science master's program at Rutgers University and then took a job as a formulation analytical scientist at Pfizer in Andover, MA.</p>
<p>During the first semester of his master's studies, Leslie reports coming to the realization <span class="quote">"that the whole COVID narrative was absolute nonsense,"</span> that the so-called <span class="quote">"vaccines were actually death shots,"</span> and even further, in a position challenging a well-established consensus, he became convicted that virology itself <span class="quote">"was one big pseudoscience."</span></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>He further accepted his position at Pfizer in March 2021 with the specific intention of becoming a whistleblower should he come across important inside information, even having corresponded with Project Veritas (PV) at this time to offer his services.</p>
<p>After reaching out to PV again, they provided him with undercover recording equipment he began wearing to work in late September 2021. Soon after, he provided PV with a vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and gathered with other PV personnel and Dr. Carrie Madej to investigate the contents in a Mamaroneck, New York apartment on October 14, 2021.</p>
<p>Madej, an internist trained in osteopathic medicine, became well-known on the internet warning viewers to avoid the COVID injections and for examining these substances as well. On this occasion, Leslie explains how the doctor guided the microscope examination of these samples from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and the vial from Pfizer which he had provided.</p>
<p>In the J&amp;J sample the group witnessed what the young whistleblower explained as <span class="quote">"black circles and what looked like parasites revolving around them as if they had a mind of their own."</span> The Moderna and Pfizer samples <span class="quote">"had similar parasitic-like creatures in them,"</span> and while he couldn't identify what he was looking at, he said, <span class="quote">"it was absolutely nightmarish to witness."</span></p>
<p>Six days later, Madej was a guest on the Stew Peters Show where she explained these phenomena, also stating she had been working with an <span class="quote">"amazing team"</span> from PV promising that they would be <span class="quote">"giving their story very soon, which will have so much detail, so much data, so please look for that."</span></p>
<p>But instead of releasing this story that several members of this PV team witnessed themselves, Leslie states <span class="quote">"this entire story was buried by Project Veritas"</span> and it never came out, even as other researchers such as Dr. Robin Wakeling in New Zealand, and Dr. David Nixon in Australia, corroborated the findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article also mentioned that he promoted Stew ops about changes in the blood of vaccinated people seen with dark field microscopy, calamari clots, and luciferase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The documentary covers several other stories Leslie believes were of vital importance to the public which were declined for publication by Project Veritas. These include evidence of significant <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/blood-damage-explains-many-harmful-impacts-of-covid-vaccines/>changes in blood</a> following COVID <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bayer-executive-mrna-shots-are-gene-therapy-marketed-as-vaccines-to-gain-public-trust/>vaccine</a> injections, the widespread presentation of large <span class="quote">"white fibrous"</span> <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/70-of-embalmers-report-finding-strange-blood-clots-beginning-in-mid-2021/>blood clots</a> which began to appear in corpses beginning in 2021, and indications of the <span class="quote">"glowing"</span> enzyme <a href=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bombshell-pfizer-whistleblower-says-vaccine-glows-contains-toxic-luciferase-graphene-oxide-compounds/>luciferase</a> being present in the injections, which Leslie testifies he witnessed himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During an interview with Stew Peters in October 2021, Carrie Madej said: <span class="quote">"I have worked with Project Veritas - an amazing team there - and they were able to work with a whistleblower from Pfizer, and through chain of custody they brought forward some of the vials. So I have some of my own images. But Project Veritas will, you know, be giving their story very soon which will have so much detail, so much data."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/vnzy9f-shocking-dr%2e-carrie-madej-releases-first-look-at-pfizer-vial-contents.html>https://rumble.com/vnzy9f-shocking-dr%2e-carrie-madej-releases-first-look-at-pfizer-vial-contents.html</a>, time 1:32] So it matches up with Justin Leslie's story.</p>
<p>The Pfizer whistleblower Melissa McAtee has also said that COVID vaccines contain hydrogel, nanotechnology, graphene oxide, and quantum dots:</p>

<img src=i/pfizerstew-mcatee.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The earliest reference to Melissa McAtee/Strickler I found on Twitter was from October 7th 2021 UTC after she had already come out as a whistleblower on Project Veritas, and after they had already released a slickly produced video of her interview with O'Keefe (which now has about 4 million views on YouTube). [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22melissa+strickler%22+until%3A2021-10-8&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=%22melissa+strickler%22+until%3A2021-10-8&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXGB5FzhPc>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXGB5FzhPc</a>]</p>
<hr />
<p>In April 2025 Justin Leslie said that the calamari clots are teslaphoresis carbon nanotubial systems: <span class="quote">"It's more just my perspective on the sense of what is the spike protein. It is some sort of toxic poison that is inside of the vaccine in the way that it was formulated. It is what was ultimately causing this teslaphoresis carbon nanotubial system to be created inside the body, which is ultimately what my hypothesis on the blood clots being pulled out of people are. And so, you know, ultimately, from my perspective, it's not even a lab leak, sir, it's a massive psychological operation."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6spd0f-pfizer-whistleblower-justin-leslie-joins-alex-jones-to-reveal-how-mrna-covi.html?start=1267>https://rumble.com/v6spd0f-pfizer-whistleblower-justin-leslie-joins-alex-jones-to-reveal-how-mrna-covi.html?start=1267</a>]</p>

<p>In July 2024 the <span class="quote">"International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research"</span> published a paper by Daniel Broudy and Youngmi Lee titled <span class="quote">"Real-Time Self-Assembly of Stereomicroscopically Visible Artificial Constructions in Incubated Specimens of mRNA Products Mainly from Pfizer and Moderna: A Comprehensive Longitudinal Study"</span>. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102</a>]</p>
<p>Even though the authors used an optical microscope, they wrote that they were able to see structures that <span class="quote">"resembled carbon nanotube filaments"</span>: <span class="quote">"As time progressed during incubation, simple one- and two-dimensional structures over two or three weeks became more complex in shape and size developing into stereoscopically visible entities in three-dimensions. They resembled carbon nanotube filaments, ribbons, and tapes, some appearing as transparent, thin, flat membranes, and others as three-dimensional spirals, and beaded chains."</span> Ana Maria Mihalcea also wrote that one of David Nixon's optical microscope photos showed a <span class="quote">"carbon nanotube"</span>. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20250513035136/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures>http://web.archive.org/web/20250513035136/https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/new-images-of-self-assembly-structures</a>]</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy is a member of the editorial team of the journal IJVTPR which published his paper. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam</a>] The editorial team also includes Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, Stephanie Seneff, James Lyons-Weiler, Russell Blaylock, and Shimon Yanowitz.</p>
<p>The introduction of the paper in IJVTPR said: <span class="quote">"The fact that such nanotechnology is in the COVID-19 injectables was first discussed, we believe, by Campra and colleagues (2021a, 2021b; Spectroscopy &amp; Campra, 2021) and was followed up by Yanowitz (2022a, 2022b, 2023a, 2023b) as documented in part by Hughes (2022) with 26 references to Campra et al. and 26 to Yanowitz's early work."</span> The references to Yanowitz were links to videos he did with Sasha Latypova, Maria Zeee, and Doctors for COVID Ethics.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the paper also mentioned Latypova: <span class="quote">"Sasha Latypova, an executive and researcher for the pharmaceutical industry, discovered an extreme deviation in side effects among the batch-to-batch vials of mRNA COVID-19 injectables."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102/291>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102/291</a>] However Latypova wrote this tweet about the paper: <span class="quote">"I saw the research published in this paper being done a year ago. I am in the same signal group with the authors. No judgement, but the paper does NOT show <span class="quote">'self-assembling nanotechnology'</span>. There is a bunch of optical microscopy (can't see nano) and no evidence of coherent technology. Nano-and micro-junk is not technology! A lot of this is just hydrogel curing and decomposing. That it makes some regular looking structures is not a proof of anything other than don't inject this crap. Now that John Campbell is promoting it, this confirms that it's a red herring, a distraction. He never speaks about real threats, at least not when they matter. His channel is heavily supported/promoted by someone behind this whole crime and he is a puppet."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1832422894799819219>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1832422894799819219</a>] I pointed out to her that she had promoted the earlier Stew Ops in the same genre by David Nixon, Shimon Yanowitz, and Mat Taylor, but she said that <span class="quote">"Yes, I wrote this and I stand by this, as Matt did a lot of good observational work and at least at the time was careful about making grandiose claims that <span class="quote">'nanotechnology'</span> cult members are not making."</span> However it's interesting that she said that she was in the same Signal group with the authors. When she interviewed Shimon Yanowitz in 2022, Yanowitz also said that they had a mutual friend in South Korea, which probably meant Youngmi Lee.</p>

<p>It's also interesting that Broudy is a professor at a Christian college, because Christian organizations have served as a notorious front for western intelligence in East Asia. Many people in Miles Guo's movement are also Christians. In an interview with Died Suddenly, Broudy's Korean coauthor Youngmi Lee also said that she was a Christian.

<p>When I searched for tweets about Youngmi Lee, most of the tweets were posted either by accounts that promoted Miles Guo or accounts that posted about western conspiracy topics in East Asian languages.

[<a href=https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1821862671328714830>https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1821862671328714830</a>]</p>
<p>Daniel Broudy wrote an article that was published by PANDA and he did a video presentation for PANDA. [<a href=https://pandata.org/the-serpent-and-the-staff/>https://pandata.org/the-serpent-and-the-staff/</a>, <a href=https://pandata.org/patterns-of-deception-and-deviance-post-truth/>https://pandata.org/patterns-of-deception-and-deviance-post-truth/</a>] He is the co-director and co-editor of an online publication called Propaganda in Focus along with Piers Robinson, who used to be listed as one of six team members of the Nick Hudson Institute. [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20230508084023/https://pandata.org/panda-team/>http://web.archive.org/web/20230508084023/https://pandata.org/panda-team/</a>] Daniel Broudy is one of three co-editors of Synesthesia Journal, whose review board includes Piers Robinson. [<a href=https://www.synaesthesiajournal.com/contact.html>https://www.synaesthesiajournal.com/contact.html</a>] The third editor of Propaganda in Focus is Mark Crispin Miller, whose bio says that he used to teach courses on propaganda at New York University and that he has received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation:</p>

<p>The War of the Worlds broadcast was orchestrated by psychologists from New York under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. An article published by the Rockefeller Archive described that the authors later received another grant to research the public reaction to the broadcast: <span class="quote">"In his grant proposal, Cantril identified the public reaction to the War of the Worlds broadcast as <span class="quote">'an almost unparalleled source of data'</span> for those interested in understanding the impact of radio on mass movements. It would also be of use to educators troubled by what the response to the broadcast suggests about <span class="quote">'critical thinking and propaganda.'</span> It was a persuasive argument for program officers seeking to understand more clearly how propaganda works, and how to better educate Americans in media literacy."</span> [<a href=https://resource.rockarch.org/story/war-of-the-worlds-rockefeller-philanthropies-disinformation-and-media-literacy-in-the-1930s/>https://resource.rockarch.org/story/war-of-the-worlds-rockefeller-philanthropies-disinformation-and-media-literacy-in-the-1930s/</a>] So I wonder if modern-day researchers of propaganda similarly release propaganda themselves in order to study how the public audience reacts to propaganda.</p>
<p>IJVTPR also published two papers about nanotechnology in COVID vaccines coauthored by Daniel Broudy and Valerie Kyrie. [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49</a>, <a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32</a>] Kyrie's bio says that her doctoral thesis focused on the topic of reality perception and its manipulation: <span class="quote">"With a PhD in Experimental Psychology, Masters in Clinical Psychology, Kyrie is working in the areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and psychological operations / perception management. Her doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of reality-perception and its manipulation."</span> The other paper said: <span class="quote">"The impetus for this cross-disciplinary study was current reports from a substantial proportion of injected subjects who emitted alphanumeric signals in the frequency range corresponding to Bluetooth communications networks. [...] The <span class="quote">'vaccines'</span> (hereafter, <span class="quote">'platforms'</span>) are at the very center of the construction of a global network of communications needed for the commodification of objects and bodies (Sinclair et al., 2019). [...] With researchers and practitioners around the world reporting undeclared and apparently bizarrely (bio)mechanical nano-contents in COVID-19 injections (Anonymous, 2022a; Anonymous 2022b; Botha, 2021; Campra, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2022; Delgado, 2022; Ghitalla, 2021a; La Quinta Columna, 2022; Lee et al., 2022; Monteverde et al., 2022; Shelton &amp; Gray, 2021; Young, 2021), accompanied by evidence of unidentified inorganic structures in the blood of injected individuals (Anonymous, 2022b; Botha, 2021; Ghitalla, 2021b; Koroknay, 2021; van Welbergen, 2021; Yanowitz, 2022; Young, 2021), combined with reports of apparent Bluetooth connectivity in the vaccinated (Sarlangue et al., 2021), a set of possibilities anchored in relevant scientific literatures has been proposed."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49/302>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/49/302</a>]</p>
<p>The senior editor of IJVTPR is Christopher A. Shaw who is also listed as an author at Propaganda in Focus.

<p>As far as I can tell Lee and Broudy never wrote in their paper that they saw nanobots, but only <span class="quote">"nanobot-like structures"</span>, <span class="quote">"algae-typed magnetic nanobot-like spirals"</span>, <span class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like coils"</span>, <span class="quote">"nanoparticles"</span>, <span class="quote">"nanowires"</span>, and <span class="quote">"nanostructures"</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <span class="red">magnetic nanobot-like structure</span> appeared at about 180 days incubation and disappeared later in distilled water.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Nearing the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity - after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days - specific <span class="red">algae-type magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils</span>, dark irregular spirals, appeared near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In the late stage of Moderna incubation (day 630) in distilled water, <span class="red">nanoparticles</span> reappeared floating again as previously seen during initial microscopic observations before culturing had commenced. This reappearance suggests a recycling pattern we describe later in a proposed model at Figure 27. While Moderna showed just a few filamentous structures with unique split ends and a few bundles of loose thin transparent <span class="red">nanowires</span>, Pfizer, in contrast, showed very few nanoparticles floating in close proximity to the filaments or ribbons, but in a background largely cleared of surrounding nano-debris.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Culture dishes were placed directly on a heat template set at 36.5 degrees Celsius overnight. The next morning assembled <span class="red">nanostructures</span> were observed floating over the surface of the medium in more discernible and developed shapes than before the heat (warming) exposure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During an interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea, Youngmi Lee first emphasized that the photos she showed were taken with an optical microscope so nano-scale structures were not visible. But then she showed the photos below from her paper and said: <span class="quote">"These structures are conformed as magnetic nanobot, you know. I saw same structures... exactly the same structure, at 2016 paper... I don't remember the paper name... and cited in our paper as 2019 paper. Anyway, both of papers confirmed these structures are from magnetic nanobots."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html>https://rumble.com/v5byv09-millions-of-self-assembly-nanoparticles-in-covid-19-injections-ep-33.html</a>, 34:27] So because a micro-scale structure had a similar shape as a nano-scale structure, she was able to deduce that the micro-scale structure was composed of nanotechnology. Because I guess nanotechnology works like some kind of a mandelbrot set where larger structures are composed of smaller structures which have a similar shape as the larger structures:</p>
<div>

<p>Next she showed the slide below which featured a real image of a microalgae-based biohybrid robot, but then she compared it to the helical structure shown on the right and she said: <span class="quote">"I didn't know that what is it. But our member Lisa... You know Lisa, you remember? Yeah, Lisa noticed, Lisa from... macronanobot. So whoa! Surprise! Amazing! I found macronanobot from my incubation study with Pfizer, you know."</span> [time 36:44]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-7.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>There were zero hits on Google Search for the word <span class="quote">"macronanobot"</span>, which sounds like an oxymoron. When I asked ChatGPT what the maximum size of a nanobot was, it said that <span class="quote">"Anything significantly larger than a few micrometers would generally not be considered a <span class="quote">'nanobot'</span> but rather a microbot."</span></p>
<p>The papers from 2016 and 2019 which Lee referred to were cited in a paragraph of their paper which said: <span class="quote">"Our culture studies revealed that the Pfizer products in simple distilled water produced a variety of transparent ribbons, thin film-like membranes, coils, and spirals even without exposure to special supplements or ambient energy sources. These patterns of growth and appearance in the culture media could not be explained apart from mechanisms of action peculiar to nanotechnology (Cao, <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201901849>2019</a>; Truong et al., <a href=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/py/c6py00639f>2016</a>)."</span> I didn't find any images of spiral-like structures in either paper though.</p>
<p>The paper by Lee and Broudy said that the spiral structure was <span class="quote">"bio-nano-robot like"</span>: <span class="quote">"Nearing the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity - after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days - specific algae-type magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils, dark irregular spirals, appeared near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14)."</span> But I guess it's good enough if it's just nano-robot like even though it's on a completely different scale than nanobots.</p>
<p>Lee and Broudy also wrote that they analyzed skin samples of a patient with a variety of Morgellons disease: <span class="quote">"During the initial period of incubation, skin extracts (a variety of Morgellons) from an injected subject were placed in normal saline. The donor of the extracts was a patient suffering from the side effects of a paralytic seizure sustained just days after injection of the mRNA experimental product. Her specimens from the Moderna injectable were anonymized and coded as Extract 1 (E1). During the initial examination of the skin extract, surrounding particles appeared and seemed to exhibit a symbiotic relationship through direct observation under the stereomicroscope. After one month incubation of E1, enough seed-shaped particles, less than 1 μm in their largest dimension, sufficiently developed in size were observed floating and moving around the main portion of the skin extract in the saline solution of the culture dish."</span> In 2022 Shimon Yanowitz also told Sasha Latypova that his blood contained an entity that might have been Morgellons, and it looked very mean and it made red blood cells nervous. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZFHWKEYxlCa/</a>, time 9:21] Lee and Broudy cited the video as a source in a paragraph of their paper which said it was a fact that COVID vaccines include nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The policy of the IJVTPR journal says: <span class="quote">"Citations of blogs, websites, government agencies, or other sources that either lack a peer-review process or that are known to publish researchers with undisclosed pecuniary biases, are not acceptable unless flagged appropriately and critiqued."</span> [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about</a>] However the paper by Lee and Broudy cited 5 Rumble videos, 2 BitChute videos, drsambailey.com, anamariamihalceamdphd.substack.com, karenkingston.substack.com, and thehighwire.com, but none of those sources were was critiqued or flagged as unreliable.</p>
<hr />
<p>The People's Voice published an article about Lee and Broudy's paper titled <span class="quote">"Japan Declares State of Emergency After <span class="quote">'Nanobots'</span> Found in 96 Million Citizens"</span>. [<a href=https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/>https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/japans-declares-state-of-emergency-after-nanobots-found-in-96-million-citizens/</a>] However the main text of the article didn't say anything about Japan declaring a state of emergency or nanobots being found in 96 million citizens.</p>
<p>When I searched for the earliest tweets that matched the phrase <code>96 million nanobots</code>, the first three users after Sean Adl-Tabatabai who posted about the story all seemed like fake accounts: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&src=typed_query&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=96%20million%20nanobots%20until%3A2024-8-11&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live</a>, <a href=https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495>https://x.com/JA_strategist/status/1822367446835007495</a>, <a href=https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567>https://x.com/SteabhanMacGR/status/1822381572928180567</a>]</p>

<p>The avatars of two of the three users look AI-generated. The account on the left portrays a black man from Ghana who posts a large number of tweets about American political topics for some reason. It had posted about 40,000 tweets by September 2024 but its oldest tweet returned by the search was from July 2024 (even though that might be if it had changed its username in July 2024, because the search doesn't return tweets that were posted under a different username).

But the face in general has the kind of overal blurry appearance as AI-generated 3D images. The avatar of the white man looks even more clearly fake, and the tufts of hair on the left side of the photo are also highly blurred compared to the front of the face:</p>

<p>The display name of the other account is Steabhán Mac Giolla Riabhaigh, which would probably be the name of only a single person in the world if he was a real person. But when I googled for the name, all of the results seemed to be about either the Twitter account or about two YouTube channels which only had a couple of short videos.

<p>A thread about the article by The People's Voice was posted by this account that posts in Turkish and that seems to primarily post about flat earth: [<a href=https://x.com/2024T2024/status/1824279665390805141>https://x.com/2024T2024/status/1824279665390805141</a>]</p>

<p>About a month after Lee and Broudy's paper had been published, the IJVTPR journal published a commentary on the paper by Anne Ulrich, who is the chair of biochemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. She wrote the following: [<a href=https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/106/321>https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/106/321</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has long been known in the field of biophysics that all of the intriguing geometries described here by Lee and Broudy (2024) can emerge naturally from lipid preparations, as are used in the modRNA vaccinations in the form of lipid nanoparticles. They may show up especially when samples are stored over extended periods - or under inappropriate conditions. The astonishing μm-sized architectures can be explained by a simple physical process called lipid self-assembly. Notably, lipids make up the bulk of the vaccine ingredients, in other words, 2.5 mg/ml (one quarter of which is cholesterol), compared to a mere 0.1 mg/ml modRNA, in the presence of about 100 mg/ml sucrose and salts (as declared for ready-to-use Comirnaty/BNT162b2). Therefore, instead of seeking an explanation for the strange objects in terms of exotic additives, it is more plausible to start looking at the materials that are already known to be abundantly present in the injectable formulations.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In fresh modRNA preparations or samples that have been stored properly, no objects should be visible under an optical microscope, because the original nanoparticles with a diameter of around 55 nm are well below the resolution limit of 200 nm (Unruh et al., 2024). According to the manufacturer, the unopened injectable suspensions are stable for up to 10 weeks in a refrigerator. However, if they are stored for longer times or at higher temperatures, or are subjected to freeze-thawing, dilution, agitation, different salt concentrations or pH values, they can break down progressively. The delicate RNA chains are generally sensitive to hydrolysis by acids, bases, bacteria, and enzymes (for example, trace amounts of ribonuclease on the human skin), as well as to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen. Lipids can also decompose chemically in similar ways. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna injectables are in fact quite stable towards physical stressors for up to 8 days. However, the cholesterol and RNA contained therein are photosensitive and tend to get oxidized under irradiation corresponding to bright sunlight (Fongaro et al., 2023). As a result of any such degradation process, the lipids will rearrange in new ways once they have lost their cohesion due to fragmentation of the RNA chains or due to any change in the molecular composition of the sample.</p>
<p>It is commonly accepted that the physical shapes and sizes of lipid nanoparticles (especially in combination with RNA or DNA) tend to be only meta-stable. This means that the particles are kinetically trapped and have not yet reached their lowest energy state thermodynamically. As a consequence, time-dependent changes in their morphological appearance would be expected simply upon letting them stand. It is important to note that Lee and Broudy (2024) not only incubated their material for extended periods of up to 12 months; but, in fact, they diluted some samples with distilled water or blood plasma. To other samples they added oxidants like H2O2 or ClO2, or they mixed them with some electrolyte solutions, or various colloidal/mineral suspensions. Any changes in the aqueous environment, as well the addition of low molecular weight compounds, proteins or colloids, can dramatically affect the stability of nanoparticles. Under the diverse experimental conditions that were used, a regrouping of the lipids into other types of structures is not at all surprising.</p>
<p>A lipid mixture can often take on several different phase states and/or structural shapes, as is conveniently displayed in a phase-diagram, usually as a function of temperature and water content. But other parameters, too, have an influence of the phase behaviour of lipid systems, such as the component ratios, salt, pH, additives, pressure, etc., many of which will have been affected under the different experimental conditions. It is obvious that some molecular phase separation or de-mixing has taken place in some of the incubated vaccine samples, allowing the poorly water-soluble cholesterol to crystallize out. This interpretation can fully explain the appearance of the sharp-edged platelets and angular chips (top left corner of Figure 1), which have already been attributed to cholesterol crystals (or even simple salt) in earlier discussions cited by Lee and Broudy (2024).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The McCullough Foundation caught a lot of flak after they tweeted a link to Lee and Broudy's paper, but they later deleted the tweet and posted a link to the rebuttal by Anne Ulrich instead. [<a href=https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1834316750764069339>https://x.com/McCulloughFund/status/1834316750764069339</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 IJVTPR published a paper by David Hughes titled <span class="quote">"What Is in the So-called COVID-19 <span class="quote">'Vaccines'</span>? Part 1: Evidence of a Global Crime Against Humanity"</span>. It featured images of microchips by the Fifth Column and images of hydras by Carrie Madej: [<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However David Hughes is also a writer at Propaganda in Focus, where his bio says that he lectures in security studies and his areas of research include <span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span class="quote">"the class relations between psychological operations"</span>: [<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/</a>]</p>

<img src=i/alt-broudy-18.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>So IJVTPR has published papers about nanotechnology in COVID shots by at least 3 different people who are all specialized in researching propaganda or psychological operations, who are Daniel Broudy, Valerie Kyrie, and David Hughes. The team of three propagandists has also written articles that were published by Solari Report and Unlimited Hangout: [<a href=https://researchmap.jp/d_broudy?lang=en>https://researchmap.jp/d_broudy?lang=en</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/alt-broudy-19.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The article published in Solari Report said that <span class="quote">"we have prepared a video summary of our article, which was presented as part of the Doctors for Covid Ethics Fifth Symposium in December 2022"</span>: [<a href=https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/>https://constitution.solari.com/global-class-war-and-the-politics-of-a-hatchet-job-a-reply-to-john-waters/</a>]</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Doctors for COVID Ethics is kind of a shady organization, and earlier on this page I pointed out how Latypova and Yeadon have also been speakers in their symposiums, and in 2022 they published a long article by Latypova before she had her own Substack. The paper by Lee and Broudy cited four different videos by Shimon Yanowitz, but one of them was a presentation he did for Doctors for COVID Ethics:</p>

<p>Not surprisingly David Hughes claims that the pandemic was fake, because he wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19 pandemic'</span> was a Big Lie: there is no credible epidemiological evidence to support its existence. Rather, the <span class="quote">'pandemic'</span> was a media-driven social phenomenon that served to deflect attention from far-reaching technocratic agendas being advanced across every area of life."</span> [<a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-41850-1_6>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-41850-1_6</a>] He also wrote: <span class="quote">"The <span class="quote">'Covid-19 pandemic'</span> was, in the view of Kyrie and Broudy (2022a), conjured out of <span class="quote">'mass hysteria, malpractice, censorship and juggled data.'</span>"</span></p>

<a href=#Table_of_earliest_interviews_of_people_mentioned_on_this_page id=Table_of_earliest_interviews_of_people_mentioned_on_this_page>Table of earliest interviews of people mentioned on this page</a>
</h2>
<p>One way to gauge whether someone in alternative media is genuine or not is to look at which channels they did their alt media on, but if it's the Stew Peters Show like in the case of Sasha Latypova and David Nixon, then they're probably not legitimate.</p>
<p>Another sign that someone is not legitimate is if they don't publish much of their own research in textual form but they're more focused on doing video or audio interviews. For example Sasha Latypova had a Telegram channel before she appeared on Stew Peters, but I don't know about any presence that Karen Kingston or Richard Hirschman had in the COVID conspiratard movement before they started doing video interviews.</p>
<p>I tried to compile a table of the earliest video or audio interviews that various people mentioned in this HTML file did in alt media. The table might be missing a few early interviews for some people. The dates are generally in UTC but some dates might be a day off from UTC dates. Some dates are the date when a tweet about a video was posted on Twitter which might be one or a few days off from the date of the video. Out of the people in this table, J.J. Couey and David Martin started posting videos on their own YouTube channel before their earliest interview listed here.</p>

<a href=#Stews_lawsuit_against_Lauren_Witzke_and_sponsorship_by_GoldCo id=Stews_lawsuit_against_Lauren_Witzke_and_sponsorship_by_GoldCo>Stew's lawsuit against Lauren Witzke and sponsorship by GoldCo</a>
</h2>
<p>Stew Peters posted this tweet in April 2024: <span class="quote">"The <span class="citation" data-cites="DiedSuddenly_">@DiedSuddenly_</span> account has been hijacked by <span class="citation" data-cites="LaurenWitzkeDE">@LaurenWitzkeDE</span> et al and is currently not being run by the Stew Peters Network."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915>https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1776687243760918915</a>] Around the same time he filed a lawsuit against Lauren Witzke's production company TLM Global, which he had hired to produce his show and films. [<a href=https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/>https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68403646/fokiss-inc-v-tlm-global-llc/</a>]</p>
<p>An article about the lawsuit said the following: [<a href=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire>https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/lawsuit-exposes-internal-feuds-and-inner-workings-of-stew-peters-extremist-media-empire</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial complaint, which notes that Fokiss is doing business as the Stew Peters Network, accuses the TLM team of making <span class="quote">"unauthorized donation solicitations"</span> on a website associated with <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly."</span> Fokiss' complaint also alleged all of the defendants made <span class="quote">"improper"</span> applications for trademarks associated with the <span class="quote">"Died Suddenly"</span> brand. The court filing also includes a copy of a termination letter that Peters apparently sent to Szall on January 27, 2024 in an attempt to end their business relationship. That letter describes the <span class="quote">"ownership confusion of the <span class="quote">'DIED SUDDENLY'</span> name, twitter page, and documentary"</span> along with <span class="quote">"unapproved postings, fundraisers, and even subscription sign ups"</span> that Peters called <span class="quote">"unacceptable"</span> and even <span class="quote">"criminal."</span></p>
<p>Despite these concerns Peters indicated in the letter a willingness to continue to work with Szall, Witzke, and TLM. Peters specified that Crosstalk <span class="quote">"may continue to air on the SPN."</span> He also discussed the terms for this, which he indicated were part of a separate <span class="quote">"contract."</span> The deal outlined by Peters in the letter indicated that <span class="quote">"Crosstalk"</span> was fully produced by TLM and then delivered to his company on the afternoon it was aired. He wrote that TLM needed to pay $1,600 monthly to air on the network. The exchange indicates that, at least in this case, Peters charged other hosts to make content for his network, which offered them the benefit of exposure to his following. Peters also wrote that TLM had an <span class="quote">"ongoing obligation to complete and deliver ... the remaining two documentaries"</span> for which he said they were already <span class="quote">"paid in full for by the Stew Peters Network."</span></p>
<p>The complaint details the amount TLM was paid to make documentaries for Peters. It also identified Goldco, a relatively mainstream company that helps clients invest in gold and other precious metals as the primary funder of the Stew Peters Network and its documentaries.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Goldco had two sponsorship agreements with Peters' company that ran from April 2022 to the end of last month. He has continued to identify the company as a sponsor in more recent broadcasts as well. The complaint described Goldco as providing <span class="quote">"the majority of the Network's annual budgets and production requirements."</span> Goldco and its CEO, Trevor Gerszt, did not respond to questions from TPM about its role financing Peters' network, and its extremist content.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Peters' company provided TLM a <span class="quote">"documentary budget"</span> of $379,000 through two separate payments last year that were <span class="quote">"generally tied to the Plaintiff's obligations to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2024 on the Fresh and Fit podcast, one of the hosts asked Stew Peters: <span class="quote">"Didn't you say in a lawsuit that you were almost completely funded by a Jewish gold company Goldco?"</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v4x7str-stew-peters-meets-fresh-and-fit.html>https://rumble.com/v4x7str-stew-peters-meets-fresh-and-fit.html</a>, time 48:24] Then Stew answered: <span class="quote">"Could I say that I'm funded by a Jewish gold company? Yeah, I am. I mean, Goldco is a great company. They sponsored the film. So in essence I guess you could say that I'm funded by these people. These people give me the funds to go create material and content that I produce to the public for free. So, yeah, I mean, I guess you could say that. The guy that owns Goldco, uh, says that he's a Jew, so."</span> [clip at <a href=https://x.com/_RantCast/status/1832767843655684448>https://x.com/_RantCast/status/1832767843655684448</a>]</p>
<p>During the same podcast Stew Peters also said that Lauren Witzke had a fake white nationalist persona: <span class="quote">"She's like this, um, fake Christian white nationalist gal that has like this online presence of being like, um, you know, Ms. Nick Fuentes kind of sort of. You know, take all of his view points, carbon copy them, put them into her - her online presence, that's her persona. Ok, but she's now like pregnant with a Mexican who I think is gay, a brown baby, and she's like, <span class="quote">'Yeah, whatev'</span>."</span> [time 54:25; clip at <a href=https://x.com/RightWingWatch/status/1795475776663363958>https://x.com/RightWingWatch/status/1795475776663363958</a>]</p>
<p>In the initial claim filed by Stew Peters basically stated that Goldco owned his ass: [<a href=https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982.1.0.pdf>https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982/gov.uscourts.flsd.664982.1.0.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>43. On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a sponsorship agreement with GoldCo (the <span class="quote">"GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement"</span>), a company that provides services in the precious metals industry.</p>
<p>44. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, GoldCo and Plaintiff worked out an annual budget for GoldCo's sponsorship of the Network.</p>
<p>45. Pursuant to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, Plaintiff had certain requirements it had to meet such as mentioning GoldCo as a sponsor throughout its Network and also producing and releasing a certain amount of documentaries during each GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement contractual term.</p>
<p>46. The initial GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement term commenced on April 28, 2022 and ended on April 28, 2023 (the <span class="quote">"Initial Term"</span>).</p>
<p>47. Since the Initial Term, Plaintiff and GoldCo have renewed the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement for a second term (the <span class="quote">"Second Term"</span>), which commenced on April 28, 2023 and is set to expire on April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>48. While GoldCo is not a party to this action, the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement is a vital piece to the relationship, duties, and responsibilities of the parties hereto because the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement, and the requirements therein, provided the majority of the Network's annual budgets and production requirements.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>53 . Both Plaintiff and TLMG understood that their Agreement regarding Network Production and Documentary Production and the obligations therein were generally tied to the Plaintiff's obligations to the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement because GoldCo provided the majority of the budget for the production of the Network and also because the GoldCo Sponsorship Agreement had strict requirements regarding the number of documentaries that would be released by Plaintiff in each contract term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023 when Stew Peters was attacked by Media Matters because of his antisemititism, Lauren Witzke posted a tweet which said <span class="quote">"Support Stew from this slanderous attack and buy gold here: goldco.com/stew"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709576077771706637>https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709576077771706637</a>] She also posted a tweet which said <span class="quote">"Media Matters will be hearing from our very vicious and money hungry Jewish lawyer!"</span> [<a href=https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709579540710797680>https://x.com/LaurenWitzkeDE/status/1709579540710797680</a>]</p>
<p>An interview of Goldco's founder said: <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">'As a young boy in South Africa, I would get silver dollars on birthdays and Jewish holidays,'</span> he says. <span class="quote">'I would look at these older coins and was amazed. I would savor them and collect them.'</span>"</span> [<a href=https://calbizjournal.com/gold-standard/>https://calbizjournal.com/gold-standard/</a>] Lust for gold and silver seems to be hardwired in the blood of these people.</p>
<p>Jane Ruby's interview with Youngmi Lee included a long advertisement for a company called Augusta Gold &amp; Silver, which was also listed as the first sponsor in the description of the video. [<a href=https://rumble.com/v5bv8x1-exclusive-pfizermoderna-shots-building-biohybrid-bots.html>https://rumble.com/v5bv8x1-exclusive-pfizermoderna-shots-building-biohybrid-bots.html</a>] The CEO and founder of the company is called Isaac Nuriani, who is related to people with names like Moshe Nuriani and David Levi.

</h2>
<p>In 2025 Fitts, Latypova, and Yeadon were expert witnesses in a Dutch trial where the lawyer Arno van Kessel sued 17 defendants, who included Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Albert Bourla, Ursula von der Leyen, and the former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte: [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova>https://x.com/sasha_latypova</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-witness.png width=550>
</div>
<p>In 2021 van Kessel said that people with two doses won't live longer than 5 years, and he also said that vaccines contain nanobots and graphene: [<a href=https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/advocaat-arno-van-kessel-wil-rutte-voor-de-rechter>https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/advocaat-arno-van-kessel-wil-rutte-voor-de-rechter</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel believes that Bill Gates will control us remotely through the vaccines. <span class="quote">"Honestly, believe me, I'm not a fool. We're going to be controlled remotely. Everyone who gets that shot is going to be screwed. You'll become half robot, half human. That's what happens with nanotechnology, and nanotechnology exists. The patents are real. If you had told me this two years ago, I would have said: you're crazy. But after all the research we've done... I'm not crazy. I'm a lawyer."</span></p>
<p>Gates has never said he wants to kill the world's population with vaccines. But Van Kessel insists. He claims the nanomaterial graphene oxide, an often-debunked conspiracy theory, is in the vaccines to kill people. <span class="quote">"If you've had two shots, I'm convinced you won't live longer than five years. And you do nothing about it."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel seems to be a sovereign citizenship guy, because he said that Mark Rutte was not really the prime minister of Netherlands, but rather the director of a company called the State of the Netherlands that was registered in Washington DC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Kessel says during the investigation he discovered a global conspiracy between the Freemasons and the Rockefeller Foundation, who want to form a single world government: The New World Order . He also claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been tasked with decimating the world population through coronavirus vaccines. The United Nations is said to be invoking Satan and relaying the Rockefeller Foundation's orders to the World Health Organization and the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). These orders would ultimately end up with caretaker Prime Minister Rutte and the various ministers.</p>
<p>We think Rutte is our prime minister, says Van Kessel. But according to him, that's not the case. <span class="quote">"I'm pretty convinced that everything is perception, everything is fiction. What's going on? In our perception, Mark Rutte has the title of prime minister of the Netherlands. In reality, he has the title of a company, director of the State of the Netherlands. Registered in Washington, DC. And he signed an important contract."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In June 2025 van Kessel was arrested by the Dutch anti-terrorism unit DSI because he was suspected of being involved in a criminal network: [<a href=https://bvs.nl/column-in-english/>https://bvs.nl/column-in-english/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simultaneously with a number of sovereigns, lawyer Arno van Kessel from Leeuwarden was also arrested on 11 June just before the NATO summit by 15 members of the Special Intervention Service (DSI) in the presence of the examining magistrate and the dean of the Bar Association of the Northern Netherlands (as is customary with lawyers because of their right to refuse to testify). The dean started a suspension procedure shortly afterwards, without access to details of the case, which raises questions about the independence and care of this step.</p>
<p>On 26 June 2025, Van Kessel's pre-trial detention was extended by 90 days on suspicion of involvement in a <span class="quote">"criminal network"</span> with <span class="quote">"anti-institutional ideology"</span> that may have wanted to collect or use weapons or dangerous substances, possibly in connection with the NATO summit of 24-25 June 2025 in The Hague.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An announcement by the Dutch police said: <span class="quote">"The investigation by the police and Public Prosecution Service in the Northern Netherlands focuses on a criminal network in which a large proportion of the arrested suspects adhere to anti-institutional ideology and may have the intention to use violence. [...] In addition to the arrests, searches were conducted in various locations in the Netherlands. [...] Weapons and ammunition, narcotics, possible explosives, and potentially hazardous substances were found and seized."</span> [<a href=https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2025/juni/11/01-onderzoek-naar-crimineel-netwerk---acht-verdachten-aangehouden.html>https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2025/juni/11/01-onderzoek-naar-crimineel-netwerk—acht-verdachten-aangehouden.html</a>]</p>
<p>Baxter Dmitry wrote that van Kessel was facing euthanasia by a massive death chamber: [<a href=https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/dutch-lawyer-prosecuting-bill-gates-arrested-facing-euthanazia-over-conspiracy-theories/>https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/dutch-lawyer-prosecuting-bill-gates-arrested-facing-euthanazia-over-conspiracy-theories/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-euthanasia.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>However I don't know if the arrests were just a publicity stunt to draw more attention to the court case. One article said this in Dutch: <span class="quote">"During an earlier arrest of a couple from Geesteren, the police also claimed that explosives had been found. In reality, it was an old box of fireworks that had been forgotten for years in one of their sheds."</span> [<a href=https://deanderekrant.nl/arno-van-kessel-en-aantal-soevereinen-met-veel-machtsvertoon-opgepakt/>https://deanderekrant.nl/arno-van-kessel-en-aantal-soevereinen-met-veel-machtsvertoon-opgepakt/</a>]</p>
<p>The audio and video production for Catherine Austin Fitts is done by the Dutch people who used to organize the Secret Space Program conspiracy conference. Fitts said: <span class="quote">"We have a subsidiary in the Netherlands, uh Solari Europa, so I have a Dutch partner, and it's 50/50, you know, myself and my Dutch partner. And that group, they do all our audio, videos, extraordinary people. I met them because during - from 2010 to now, they've been doing conferences on breakthrough energy and the secret space program. And their breakthrough energy group is called GlobalBEM. It's up on the internet, you can see all their presentations. [...] Breakthrough Energy Movement is what it stands for. And, you know, they have a website, and they publish all the stuff. And I've participated in some of the conferences."</span> [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piDqTbBwWRM&start=1h55m19s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piDqTbBwWRM&amp;start=1h55m19s</a>]</p>
<p>After Latypova did her alt media debut on the Stew Peters Show, I belive the next two people who interviewed her were Willem Engel from the Dutch organization Viruswaarheid, and J.J. Couey who used to live in the Netherlands. The first non-solo videos Couey did in alt media were panels hosted by George Webb's mini-me Addy Adds: <a href=clot2.html#Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Cottrell_Couey_Kulacz_and_Webb>clot2.html#Kevin_McCairns_connection_to_Cottrell_Couey_Kulacz_and_Webb</a>. The panels also featured Paul Cottrell who was George Webb's go-to guy on COVID biology. George Webb has said that he used to work with Dutch intelligence in New York, and he wrote a book about Erasmus Medical Center which is where Couey worked. Webb used to be the sidekick of Jason Goodman, whose current sidekick John Cullen speaks Dutch.</p>
<p>(I don't know if any of these Dutch connections are relevant to why Fitts or Latypova were selected as the witnesses in the trial, but I thought they were still worth mentioning.)</p>
<hr />
<p>One of van Kessel's expert witnesses is Joe Sansone, who runs a hypnosis company where his services range from assisting his clients in improving their golf game to helping them explore soul level changes: [<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-sansone-m-s-phd-ccmhc-lmhc-1a683638/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-sansone-m-s-phd-ccmhc-lmhc-1a683638/</a>]</p>

<p>In 2024 Joseph Sansone filed a court case seeking to prohibit the distribution of mRNA vaccines in Florida <span class="quote">"because they are biological and technological weapons of mass destruction"</span>. [<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/breaking-florida-lawsuit-seeks-injunction>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/breaking-florida-lawsuit-seeks-injunction</a>] In his press release about the case he wrote that <span class="quote">"Surgeon General Ladapo has publicly described the mRNA injections as the <span class="quote">'Anti Christ'</span> of drugs."</span> Affidavits to his case were provided by Francis Boyle, Karen Kingston, Ana Mihalcea, Rima Laibow, Andrew Zywiec, Marivic Villa, Avery Brinkley, Ben Marble, and Paul Alexander.</p>
<p>Francis Boyle was also going to testify in van Kessel's case but he died in 2025. Sansone wrote: <span class="quote">"Yes I helped arrange for Boyle to testify in Netherlands case. Been in contact with them over a year."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/PhdSansone/status/1959267285064892715>https://x.com/PhdSansone/status/1959267285064892715</a>]</p>
<p>Ben Marble tweeted in August 2025 that he thinks 1 billion people will have died from COVID vaccines by January 1st 2026: [<a href=https://x.com/BenMarblesX/status/1959420978599256494>https://x.com/BenMarblesX/status/1959420978599256494</a>]</p>

<p>Earlier in 2024 when Sansone filed a court case to ban COVID vaccines in Florida, he went on Maria Zeee's show together with Karen Kingston to discuss the case. [<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/karen-kingston-and-dr-joseph-sansone>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/karen-kingston-and-dr-joseph-sansone</a>] Sansone claimed that the crimes being committed against Floridians included distribution, stockpiling, and use of weapons of biological weapons (18 USC 175), distribution, stockpiling, and use of weapons of mass destruction (FL 790.166), treason (18 USC 2381), domestic terrorism (18 USC 2331), and genocide (18 USC 1091).

<p>Kingston's affidavit for the case said that <span class="quote">"I am able to read and write"</span>, but after that it said <span class="quote">"My Names is Karen Kingston"</span> and <span class="quote">"removal of the COVID-19 injections is an urgent matters"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1959866201276047531>https://x.com/Jikkyleaks/status/1959866201276047531</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-sansone-kingston.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>The earliest interview Sansone posted on his BitChute channel was an interview with Ana Maria Mihalcea. [<a href=https://rumble.com/user/joesansone/videos?page=7>https://rumble.com/user/joesansone/videos?page=7</a>] Sansone later also posted another interview with Mihalcea where they talked about <span class="quote">"mrna nanobots, AI, targeted individual program, and mind control"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/PhdSansone/status/1899248288152326530>https://x.com/PhdSansone/status/1899248288152326530</a>]</p>
<p>Joe Sansone first fell under my radar because I noticed he did many videos with minor players with people connected to calamari clots. The two earliest videos of Laura Kasner I found on Rumble were both posted by Sansone. [<a href=https://rumble.com/search/video?q=%22Laura%20Kasner%22&sort=date&page=2>https://rumble.com/search/video?q=%22Laura%20Kasner%22&amp;sort=date&amp;page=2</a>] Sansone was also one of the first people who interviewed Andrew Zywiec, and there's a semi-viral clip from the interview where Zywiec presented the fake mass spectrometry results of the clots by Solution of Scientists.</p>
<p>In 2023 Sansone was a speaker in a symposium held by Todd Callender's organization VaxxChoice, which also featured Todd Callender (who said that the calamari clots are 5G antennas), Ana Mihalcea, the DMED whistleblower Theresa Long (who supposedly discovered Richard Hirschman by chance and connected him with Jane Ruby), the Qtard lady Ann Vandersteel, and the DMED whistleblower Pete Chambers (who <a href=https://rumble.com/v4uhu30-lt-colnel-dr-peter-chambers-warns-of-possible-future-biological-event%2e.html?start=135]>said he was</a> <span class="quote">"right in the front seat of uh, doing what we call, said, unconventional warfare, which - it has a heavy piece of psychological, psyops, or information operations"</span>).

<a href=#Shimon_Yanowitz_interviewed_by_Latypova_in_April_2022 id=Shimon_Yanowitz_interviewed_by_Latypova_in_April_2022>Shimon Yanowitz interviewed by Latypova in April 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>In April 2022 Latypova published a video where Shimon Yanowitz showed her his microscope images of self-assembling structures in vaccines. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/e9mvTko2Ts0T/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/e9mvTko2Ts0T/</a>]</p>
<p>In the description of the video she wrote: <span class="quote">"Self assembly of structures is evident. This demonstrates clearly that the products are fraudulent and adulterated."</span> At time 41:25 Latypova also said: <span class="quote">"If we had honest regulator, this would be forced to recall. Because the particles, whatever particles, they're not supposed to be - they're not as product described - there's not supposed to be any particles in there. But you clearly have microscopic particles right from the start, and then they assemble into these things. That's, it's a fraudulent, adulterated, contaminated product that should be immediately recalled."</span> Were the images shown by Yanowitz really the level of evidence she needed to declare that the vaccines were contaminated and they should be recalled?</p>
<p>At time 3:15 Latypova said: <span class="quote">"I'm talking to a number of colleagues about starting an independent lab, probably somewhere in the US, and we would be able to do these kinds of experiments."</span></p>
<p>At time 16:14 Yanowitz pointed to the object I circled below, and he said: <span class="quote">"And then we started taking images after - in this case, just 20 to 30 minutes in the chamber - at room temperature, so just, you know, 20, 25 degrees centigrade. And amazingly, these started to behave like eggs, of which things started to hatch."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 29:57 Yanowitz showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"These structures still have some pods or liposomes connected to them. So I assume that these liposomes are going to give off yet more material and nano robots that are clearly inside. The nano robots could be made of DNA, but still they're nano robots."</span> But Latypova just nodded and she didn't have anything critical to say to Yanowitz:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 44:42 Yanowitz showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"This one, which again, it resembles, it looks like it has a character of some electronic circuitry with antenna, whatever. If you look at electronic integrated circuits, you'll see similar features. Maybe not so angular - they tend to be more straight - but certainly rectangular, okay."</span> But Latypova just said <span class="quote">"uh-huh"</span>, even though she should've said it doesn't look anything like electronic circuitry, but it looks like cholesterol:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-yano-eggs-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>At time 51:47 Latypova said: <span class="quote">"The part that you said, you know, it looks like micro circuitry - I talked to - some months ago - I talked to a person who is experienced in semiconductor manufacturing, but from the quality perspective. He was doing a statistical analysis for us on the batches, when we were looking at the batch variability. And he mentioned at the time that - he detected obviously huge variability, and he said this is not statistically controlled process like it's supposed to be. And then he also mentioned - if you've seen the work of La Quinta Columna, the Spanish group that was looking at the microscopic things - and he said, <span class="quote">'Oh, well, I remember this from my semiconductor manufacturing time, you know, when we were trying to reverse engineer some competitor's chip, we would throw it into acid. And these little structures, the way they look, looks almost like that, like the microchip that was thrown into acid to remove to see the circuitry and to see the design.'</span>"</span> Then Yanowitz replied: <span class="quote">"So by coincidence, since I come from electrical engineering, I spent a large part of my career, both in microscopy and in semiconductor inspection. And I know how semiconductor fabrication processes look like, and this is very reminiscent of that."</span></p>
<p>At time 54:16 Yanowitz said: <span class="quote">"We know that magnetic graphene oxide is being loaded on us, by the food industry, by the soft drink - people have - I did the experiment myself. Um, you do electrolysis of some mineral water, and you see dropping particles, and with a magnet you can just - people have stuck magnets not only to their shoulders, but to packages of meat in the supermarket. We are loaded, spraying from the air, with many materials, some of them are magnetic, some are not."</span> But Latypova just said <span class="quote">"uh-huh"</span> and <span class="quote">"wow"</span> and <span class="quote">"yeah"</span>.</p>
<p>At time 1:10:05 Latypova told Yanowitz: <span class="quote">"You collaborate with some really good and intelligent and brave people."</span> Earlier in the video Yanowitz mentioned he had collaborated with La Quinta Columna.</p>
<p>David Hughes had a story similar to Latypova's story of showing the microchip images to someone who was experienced in semiconductor manufacturing. Hughes showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"Now, when Mat Taylor showed these images to an nanotech engineer, the engineer said, <span class="quote">'What kind of circuit is that?'</span> Okay - haven't told him it's anything to do with the vaccines - it was immediately interpreted as circuitry.

</h2>
<p>In April 2025 Latypova was on the Jane Ruby Show, where she talked about chemtrails and the analysis of Jane's chemtrail fog by Mike Adams. Latypova said that she first came up with her poison theory after she and her husband drove through a weird fog and got sick: <span class="quote">"And like those fog events, actually, the weird fog events, they're significant. Because I remember when I got COVID - whatever the COVID was - it was after we drove through a humongous fog event. It was something out of this world. I've never seen anything like this. And you know, I've been on the Pacific coast. The fog is a very common thing here. This was - you could like cut it with a knife. You could not see like - if you extend your arm, you could not see your arm anymore. It was epic. And right after we drove through that cloud for an hour or so, we came home several hours later, both me and my husband were just gone. I mean, it was really neurological. This loss of taste of smell, migraine, it wasn't like it was not even coughing, but it was just the poisoning. You know, that's when I started thinking that, oh, well, it might be a neurotoxin. It's not really a virus. I don't think so."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6tbzmr-prep-act-gives-feds-cover-to-spray-americans-with-poisons.html?start=2287>https://rumble.com/v6tbzmr-prep-act-gives-feds-cover-to-spray-americans-with-poisons.html?start=2287</a>] So she gave the impression it might have been the same type of mystery fog that was sampled by Jane Ruby.</p>
<p>At time 8:30 Jane Ruby said: <span class="quote">"I get hundreds and hundreds of messages a week from all over the country and the world. And there's a pattern forming in what people are talking about, that after a fog or after - sort of a chemtrail attack where they see the skies crisscross, then it gets clear, after that clear - in the clearing time period, people are reporting sick with flu, and respiratory emergencies, and difficulty breathing, and - but like you said - flu symptoms that you might call a pandemic."</span> Apparently pandemics are fake because everything is explained by chemtrails and miasma theory.</p>
<p>In 2024 Latypova wrote: <span class="quote">"I had the covid illness, it was definitely a neurotoxic poisoning, quote nasty"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1818292872569106655>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1818292872569106655</a>] Apparently she now claims the COVID was caused by driving through fog. However when I searched her Twitter and Substack for the keyword <span class="quote">"fog"</span>, I didn't find her mentioning that she got COVID from the fog, so I don't know if she only came up with the story in 2025 to support Jane Ruby's theory that sickness is caused by fog.</p>
<p>In 2023 Latypova wrote that ivermectin cured her and her husband from COVID. [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1721387824543682587>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1721387824543682587</a>] But why would ivermectin work against poisoning by fog?</p>

<p>Jane Ruby said that her sample of mystery chemtrail fog had <span class="quote">"crazy levels of toxic metals"</span>: [<a href=https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1907477783338455173>https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1907477783338455173</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-ruby-fog.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>However Latypova also proposed that symptoms of COVID might be caused by cadmium or lead: <span class="quote">"I think over time the army, by doing these experiments and exercises - maybe originally they used these fluorescent particles as a tracer and they didn't realize they can cause respiratory illness. When they realized they can cause respiratory illness with this, they realized, <span class="quote">'Hey, this is a great way to weaponize it.'</span> So, uh, but also there's a whole category of things now that are called biomimetics, which didn't exist at the time. So biomimetics are chemical agents like these fluorescent - like cadmium or lead. [...] So they're chemicals, mimicking the effects of what's believed to be viruses, right? So they mimic respiratory illness."</span> [<a href=https://rumble.com/v6tbzmr-prep-act-gives-feds-cover-to-spray-americans-with-poisons.html?start=2446>https://rumble.com/v6tbzmr-prep-act-gives-feds-cover-to-spray-americans-with-poisons.html?start=2446</a>]</p>
<p>When someone on Twitter said that COVID is caused by 5G, Latypova said <span class="quote">"I had covid illness in the area that does not have 5G. Therefore, it wasn't 5G that caused covid illness."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1952471371856146666>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1952471371856146666</a>] But she said COVID might rather be caused by chemtrails: [<a href=https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1952458128437465144>https://x.com/sasha_latypova/status/1952458128437465144</a>]</p>

<p>The narrative about toxic mystery fog seems to have emerged around late December 2024: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2024-12-31+%28toxic+OR+mystery%29+fog+min_faves%3A50&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2024-12-31+%28toxic+OR+mystery%29+fog+min_faves%3A50&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The earliest tweets about the mystery fog by Jane Ruby I found were from December 31st 2024 UTC: [<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealdrjaneruby+fog&f=live>https://x.com/search?q=from%3Arealdrjaneruby+fog&amp;f=live</a>]</p>

<p>The earliest BitChute video I found about the toxic mystery fog was posted on December 30th 2024 UTC. It was uploaded by a channel called <span class="quote">"GreatAwakening.io - Truths &amp; Secrets Exposed"</span>. [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=mystery+fog&sort=new>https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=mystery+fog&amp;sort=new</a>]</p>
<p>In January 2025 Stew Peters did a video about the fog, where he said: <span class="quote">"Almost like it's not fog at all. Almost like it's some chemical or biological agent that's being released or sprayed and dropped down onto the masses. And just like I mentioned, wherever this fog goes, people are getting sick. People are reporting headaches, severe flu-like symptoms, or stomach issues."</span> [<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/eSeedvvn7VnC>https://www.bitchute.com/video/eSeedvvn7VnC</a>, 5:50] Next he interviewed a flat earther called Austin Wittsit, who said: <span class="quote">"I think a lot of germ theory is pseudoscience used to push different vaccines and stuff. But one thing that is real is toxic chemicals, similar to DDT, that they spray on people and claim it's polio and stuff. So this seems to be the actual way that they would be able to attack people and their health - would be an actual toxic chemical that you inhale."</span> [12:51] Sounds just like Latypova.</p>
<p>Daily Mail published an article about the mystery fog on January 3rd 2025 UTC, where they compared the fog to Operation Sea Spray: [<a href=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14248393/mystery-fog-operation-sea-spray-chemical-bioweapon.html>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14248393/mystery-fog-operation-sea-spray-chemical-bioweapon.html</a>]</p>

<p>In 2025 Latypova also started talking about Operation Sea Spray, and she said similar operations may have explained symptoms of COVID. [<a href=https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/weaponization-of-disease-agents-part-099>https://sashalatypova.substack.com/p/weaponization-of-disease-agents-part-099</a>]</p>
<p>Several videos also connected the fog to Operation Sea Spray. Some people claimed that the fog in Florida contained the same species of bacteria that was used in Operation Sea Spray (<em>Serratia marcescens</em>):</p>
