miscategorization errors."</span></p>
<p>I wrote about Neil and Fenton's paper here:
<a href=uk.html#Martin_Neil_and_Norman_Fenton_March_2024_preprint_about_the_cheap_trick>uk.html#Martin_Neil_and_Norman_Fenton_March_2024_preprint_about_the_cheap_trick</a>.</p>
<p>Neil and Fenton's cheap trick paper was recently demolished by Peter
Hegarty, who is a professor of mathematics at the University of
Gothenburg.
[<a href=https://x.com/PeterHegarty17/status/1869784526395978142>https://x.com/PeterHegarty17/status/1869784526395978142</a>]
He found that only about a quarter of the 39 papers listed by Neil and
Fenton actually employed the classification delay which Neil and Fenton
have dubbed the cheap trick, and none of the papers applied the form of
the cheap trick postulated by Neil and Fenton where the classification
delay was only applied to the numerator but not to the denominator.
Hegarty wrote: <span class="quote">"Moreover, their text and simulations
suggest they were concerned with an even much more egregious form of the
bias, whereby only Covid cases amongst the partially vaccinated
contributed to the infection rate for the unvaccinated. In other words,
partially vaccinated cases were counted in the numerator of the
infection rate for the unvaccinated, but partially vaccinated
individuals were counted in the denominator for the fully vaccinated. We
can state categorically that we found no evidence in any of the 39
studies of this <span class="quote">'trick'</span> being
employed."</span></p>
<p>The abstract of Neil and Fenton's paper said: <span
class="quote">"Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias
artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a
vaccine has zero or negative efficacy."</span> But in their simulation
the 1-to-3-week classification delay was only applied to the numerator
for cases but not to the denominator for the population size:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fenton.png width=400>
</div>
<p>When I modified their simulation so that I also applied the
classification delay to the numerator, unvaccinated and vaccinated
people got an identical infection rate:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim-4.png width=800>
</div>
<p>Earlier when Fenton and Neil posted a similar simulation on Substack,
even people in their Substack comments were saying that their simulation
was wrong:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim-6.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>I have asked Neil and Fenton to cite a single study where the
classification delay was only applied to the numerator but not to the
denominator, and I have also asked it from Mathew Crawford and James
Lyons-Weiler who have supported Neil and Fenton's approach of applying
the delay only to the numerator, but none of them has been able to cite
a single study.</p>
<p>Neil and Fenton's paper was highly misleading because they conflated
their simulation where the classification delay was only applied to the
numerator with real studies where the delay was also applied to the
denominator, but they didn't even make it clear in their paper that they
only applied the delay to the numerator in their simulation. I had to
read their old Substack post to understand how their simulation worked
because it was not described properly in their paper.</p>
<p>Kirsch also wrote: <span class="quote">"Fenton, Neil, McLachlan and
Craig also managed to successfully demonstrate to the UK Office of the
Statistics Regulator that these miscategorisation processes meant
official statistics in the UK could not be relied upon when used to
support arguments of Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness
(<a href=https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-norman-fenton-martin-neil-clare-craig-and-scott-mclachlan-ons-deaths-by-vaccination-status-statistics/>link</a>)"</span>.</p>
<p>He linked to a response by the UK Office for Statistics Regulation
which said: <span class="quote">"In your paper you also state that the
number of deaths reported within the first 21 days of receiving the
first dose of the Covid-19 vaccination is below that which could be
expected in the general population, and that this difference is evidence
of systematic undercounting of deaths by ONS. Our view of this question
starts with the consideration that the population included is not
representative of the general population, and it is therefore likely
that any pattern you observe is attributable to the <span
class="quote">'healthy vaccinee'</span> effect. This happens when people
who are ill (either due to COVID-19 or another relevant illness) are
likely to delay vaccination. The result of this effect is a
lower-than-average mortality rate within the first 21 days of receiving
a vaccination. This effect is described by ONS in their Deaths by
Vaccination Status publication."</span></p>
<p>So basically the response said that the misclassification hypothesis
by Fenton et al. was likely wrong, because the low number of deaths in
the first few weeks after vaccination can be explained by the HVE
instead. Other countries also have a very low number of deaths in the
first few weeks after vaccination if you trust the record-level datasets
from New Zealand, the United States, and the Czech Republic. It's why I
have been saying that the record-level datasets are the Achilles' heel
of the Cheap Tricksters called Fenton and Neil.</p>
<p>The letter by Craig, Neil, Fenton, and McLachlan related to a
hypothesis presented in their preprint from March 2022 titled <span
class="quote">"Official mortality data for England reveal systematic
undercounting of deaths occurring within first two weeks of Covid-19
vaccination"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358979921>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358979921</a>]
In the preprint the authors speculated that because the ONS dataset for
deaths by vaccination status had a low number of non-COVID deaths in the
first two weeks after vaccination, deaths that occurred soon after
vaccination were somehow systematically omitted or misclassified, but
the authors discounted the HVE as an explanation for the low number of
deaths. They wrote: <span class="quote">"The healthy vaccinee
hypothesis, that those close to death will postpone or decline
vaccination might hypothetically account for a lower rate of death in
the first two weeks. But as an explanation it is only plausible if every
possible death that might occur in the first two weeks, after the offer
of vaccination, was foreknown whilst those deaths in the third week were
not, and hence those dying in the third week did not postpone or decline
vaccination."</span></p>
<p>However Craig et al. didn't take into account that the temporal
healthy vaccinee effect actually lasts longer than 2 weeks, but if you
plot deaths by weeks since the first dose in England, the increasing
trend in mortality caused by the waning out of the temporal HVE is
counteracted by the decreasing trend in the background mortality rate,
because many first doses in England were given during the first three
months of 2021 when the mortality rate was falling rapidly because the
COVID wave in the winter of 2020-2021 was passing by.</p>
<p>A similar effect can also be seen in the next plot of the Czech
record-level data, where the light gray line has a sharp drop during the
first weeks after vaccination, because the light gray line is adjusted
for the background mortality rate among the entire Czech population
during the ongoing month:
[<a href=connecticut.html#Deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination>connecticut.html#Deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>And in the next plot if you look at the dark gray line which is not
adjusted for the monthly background mortality rate, the temporal HVE
only seems to last about 3 weeks because there is a dent in deaths
around the 4th week, even though it's because the rising trend in deaths
due to waning out of the HVE is counteracted by the falling trend in
background mortality rate. But in the light gray line which is adjusted
for background mortality rate, the temporal HVE seems to last around 20
weeks instead:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-4.png width=500>
</div>
<p>I believe a similar effect explains why the temporal HVE for first
doses only appears to last about 3 weeks in Kirsch's Medicare data even
though it lasts longer in Barry Young's New Zealand data, because in the
US a lot of people got the first dose during the tail end of a COVID
wave in early 2021, but New Zealand was free of COVID in 2021 when most
people got the first dose:
[<a href=connecticut.html#Comparison_of_deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination_to_other_datasets>connecticut.html#Comparison_of_deaths_by_weeks_since_vaccination_to_other_datasets</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fenton-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Clare Craig might have later come to the conclusion that the low
number of deaths during the first two weeks after vaccination might be
explained by the HVE, because in 2024 when someone asked her what she
meant by the healthy vaccinee effect, she answered that <span
class="quote">"Studies show that the first few weeks after vaccination
are outliers because people who are feeling ill postpone."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1844085783365550508>https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1844085783365550508</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 Martin Neil tweeted: <span class="quote">"The ONS's December
report claims anomalies we identified are caused by healthy vaccinee
effect. We examined the new ONS data and found NO evidence to support
this claim"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1481561698792267779>https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1481561698792267779</a>]
And in March 2024 Neil tweeted: <span class="quote">"There is no
evidence of a healthy vaccinee effect. You are signing up to an
assumption usually exploited to pretend vaccines are effective. We
demonstrated this using the ONS's own data."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1767991047940907318>https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1767991047940907318</a>]
However by April 2024 he seems to have come to the conclusion that the
HVE might be real after all based on a Czech study which said that the
HVE explained why unvaccinated people had higher mortality than
vaccinated people.
[<a href=https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1780163490247791002>https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1780163490247791002</a>]</p>
<p>So the old letter by Craig and Neil et al. might no longer represent
their current views regarding the HVE. The letter also conflicts with
the view of Kirsch, who has said that that the HVE explains why his
record-level datasets have a low number of deaths in the first few weeks
after vaccination, but he has not claimed that his record-level datasets
would suffer from the kind of miscategorization bias that was
hypothesized by Clare Craig, Martin Neil, and Norman Fenton.</p>
<p>In the ONS dataset for deaths by vaccination status, the ASMR of
people with n-1 doses shoots up when the nth dose is rolled out. Fenton
and Neil hypothesized it was because people who died soon after
receiving the nth dose were misclassified under dose n-1. But the next
plot demonstrates three major problems with their hypothesis:
[<a href=uk.html#Problems_with_Fenton_and_Neils_n_1_dose_misclassification_hypothesis>uk.html#Problems_with_Fenton_and_Neils_n_1_dose_misclassification_hypothesis</a>]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People with one but not more doses continue to have a high mortality
rate even in 2023, even though there's few new people who are getting a
second dose in 2023 so that they could be misclassified under the first
dose if they die soon after getting the second dose.</li>
<li>If a lot of extra people died soon after they got the third dose,
then why is there no big increase to the mortality rate of people with
two or more doses when the third dose is rolled out? There is only an
increase in the mortality rate of people with two but not more doses,
but the group of people with two or more doses should also include
people who are misclassified under the second dose if they die soon
after getting the third dose.</li>
<li>In November 2021 when the third dose was rolled out, people with
three doses had about 68% lower mortality rate than the general
population of England. If there is no evidence of the healthy vaccinee
effect in the ONS data like Fenton has suggested, then what explains the
low mortality rate? (Fenton might argue it's because within the first
two or three weeks from the third dose, person-years are counted under
under the third dose but deaths are counted under the second dose. But
when I first read the papers by Fenton et al., I didn't realize they
suggested that the misclassification delay was only applied to the
numerator for deaths but not to the denominator for population size. And
if I had realized that Fenton's hypothesis required the
misclassification delay to only be applied to the numerator but not to
the denominator, I would have considered the hypothesis to be much less
plausible.)</li>

<p>Kirsch wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This just-published study done by the CDC shows in Table 2 that the
Pfizer vaccine given to COVID-naive kids increases the risk of
symptomatic COVID infection: HR 3.57 (1.10, 11.63). Since, by the CDC's
own study, the vaccine increases the odds of a symptomatic COVID
infection by an estimated 3.57 in healthy kids under 4, what do you
think it will do to the elderly? It is highly unlikely for a vaccine to
simultaneously increase the risk of infection in one age group (e.g.,
children under 4) while reducing it in another age group (e.g., adults).
There are NO well-documented examples where a vaccine increased
infection risk in one demographic while reducing it in another. Show me
the counterexample if you think I'm wrong. Otherwise, we're done with
this category. Since even the CDC admits they were wrong (i.e., their
own paper shows vaccines increased risk).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper he linked is behind a paywall and not at Sci-Hub or
Researchgate so I wasn't able to read it:
<a href=https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=c46d3b29-4916-4e80-883f-c095035db6dc.><a
href="https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=c46d3b29-4916-4e80-883f-c095035db6dc"
class="uri">https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=c46d3b29-4916-4e80-883f-c095035db6dc</a>.</a>
However the abstract says that <span class="quote">"there was no
difference in risk by vaccination status"</span> (which might mean that
there was some risk but it was not significant): <span class="quote">"To
understand how coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines impact infection risk
in children &lt;5 years, we assessed risk of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from September 2022 to
April 2023 in 3 cohort studies. There was no difference in risk by
vaccination status. While vaccines reduce severe disease, they may not
reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections in naïve young children."</span></p>
<p>The results of the paper seem to match this CDC dataset where the
rate of COVID cases per person-weeks is similar in unvaccinated and

<p>canceledmouse used an alternate method to calculate the number of

the original plot by Jikkyleaks:</p>

<p>However the four studies were performed at different time periods
when Israel had different rates of daily new COVID cases. When I divided
the incidence values calculated by canceledmouse with the average daily
new cases in Israel during the period of each study, I got a higher
ratio for unvaccinated people in the first study than for people with
three doses in the last two studies:</p>

<p>Other confounders might also explain part of the difference in
results between the studies. For example the median age was 45 in the
first study (Dagan et al. 2021), but the other three studies only
included people aged 60 and above, and the median age was 72 years in
the last study.</p>

heavy vaccination and 2) incredibly high herd immunity (due to the high

Yet from an infection rate, they did much worse than the US. How is that

close to that, but if you claim more than this number, it means you are
saying the <span class="quote">"gold-standard trials"</span> are wrong
and if the gold-standard DB-RCT trials are wrong, then everything else
should be highly suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the study did not have a sufficiently large sample size to
determine the impact of the vaccine on COVID deaths, so Kirsch would
need to insert a very wide confidence interval to his estimate of 1 life
saved per 22,000 vaccinated people. The study also included only 6
months of follow-up, and it's possible that more people could have died
of COVID after the follow-up period was over.</p>
<p>The Pfizer phase 3 trial also included a low proportion of people who
were at very high risk of dying from COVID due to old age or
comorbidities.</p>

<p>CDC has published a dataset for COVID cases and deaths by vaccination

jurisdictions with a total population sample of about 100 million:

<p>However the difference between unvaccinated and vaccinated people
isn't as big for cases as for deaths, so the difference in CFR is also
not as big as the difference in deaths. Unvaccinated people still have
clearly higher CFR within age groups, even though the ratio between
unvaccinated and vaccinated CFR also gets lower over time, which might
be if unvaccinated people acquire natural immunity over time or the
effect of vaccination wears out:</p>

<p>Unfortunately the CDC dataset only starts in October 2021 so I wasn't
able to compare the CFR before and after the vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>In observational data like the CDC dataset, the percentage of
infections diagnosed as cases out of all infections might be lower for
unvaccinated people than vaccinated people, which might cause
unvaccinated people to have high CFR relative to IFR. Unvaccinated
people might be less likely to get tested than vaccinated people if for
example unvaccinated people are less likely to interact with medical
services. For example I have never gotten vaccinated or tested, because
I have not even interacted with medical services in any way in the past
5 years, but my neighbor grandma who frequently visits a hospital has
been vaccinated about 9 times and tested even more times.</p>

<p>In plain English, people who were hospitalized for Acute Respiratory
Failure (ARF) conditions <em>excluding</em> COVID were 54% more likely
to die (OR 1.54) if they were unvaccinated relative to the vaccinated.
That makes total sense due to selection bias. But those hospitalized for
COVID-19 were MUCH more likely to die if they were vaccinated (OR=3.9,
95% CI: 1.3-12.2). In short, the unvaccinated are generally less
healthy, but when it comes to COVID 19, if you got the shots and were
hospitalized for COVID, then you were much more likely to die. In short,
the vaccine did exactly the opposite of what was promised: it made you
<em>more</em> likely to die from COVID.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the mortality rates in the paper were not adjusted for age,
and among the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the median age was
about 6 years higher for vaccinated people than unvaccinated people:</p>
<div>

<p>Kirsch claimed that in the study the <span
class="quote">"unvaccinated are generally less healthy"</span> because
unvaccinated people had a higher mortality rate among the people who
were not hospitalized for COVID. But actually ST1 above shows that
unvaccinated people had a lower percentage of comorbidities than
vaccinated people (even though it's partially because unvaccinated
people were younger).</p>
<p>The study looked at the ratio of deaths per hospitalizations, but it
might be that unvaccinated people had a higher risk of hospitalization
than unvaccinated people. The paper said: <span class="quote">"In this
single-center study, 152 adult patients were admitted to Ohio State
University hospital with ARF (05/2020 - 11/2022) including 112
COVID-19-positive and 40 COVID-19-negative patients. Of the COVID-19
positive patients, 23 were vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 (Vax), and 89 were
not (NVax). Of the NVax COVID-19 patients, 46 were admitted before and
43 after SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were approved."</span> So during the period
after vaccines had been approved, there were 43 COVID hospitalizations
for unvaccinated people but only 23 hospitalizations for vaccinated
people. The observation period of the study lasted from May 2020 until
November 2022, so for most of the study period starting from the vaccine
rollout, the majority of people were vaccinated in ages 40 and above
which accounted for most COVID hospitalizations in the study.</p>
<p>The study took place in Ohio State University Hospital. In the
following code I took a weighted average of daily percentage of
vaccinated people in Ohio where the weight was the number of COVID
deaths the same day. I included the period from December 14th 2020 when
the first vaccine dose in the United States was administered until
October 31st 2022 when the observation period of the Ohio study ended.
The resulting weighted percentage of vaccinated people was about 42%,
but it includes people of all ages so the percentage would've been much
higher if I would've looked at only older age groups that account for
most COVID hospitalizations:</p>

<p>Kirsch seems to have also overlooked that the study included 23
people hospitalized for COVID in ages 19-49, but only one of them was
vaccinated, and 7 out the 22 unvaccinated people ended up dying (even
though the study only included patients hospitalized for acute
respiratory failure, so they were more likely to die than average people
hospitalized for COVID):</p>

<p>He claimed that the the healthy vaccinee effect explained why
vaccinated ASMR had a massive drop in early 2021. However in the plot
above if you look at the gray line which includes both unvaccinated and
vaccinated people, it also dropped by about 43% between March 2021 and
May 2021, which cannot be due to the healthy vaccinee effect because the
gray line includes the entire population contained in the Czech dataset.
But instead the gray line fell because there was a big drop in the
number of COVID deaths starting in March 2021:

<div>
<img src=i/czech-owid.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In order to adjust for the HVE, in the next image I plotted ASMR as
percentage of the ASMR in the second half of 2022 when there was a low
number of COVID deaths. However during the COVID wave in December 2021,
unvaccinated people still had a much bigger increase in deaths than
vaccinated people:
[<a href=czech2.html#ASMR_by_month_and_vaccine_type>czech2.html#ASMR_by_month_and_vaccine_type</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-asmrtype-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Out of the four vaccine brands included in the plot above, Janssen
has the highest relative ASMR during the COVID wave in December 2021. It
might be if Janssen vaccines were less effective than other vaccine
brands, because in a Medicare dataset from Connecticut that was
published by Kirsch, people who got a Janssen vaccine for their first
dose also had high ASMR during the winter of 2021-2022 relative to ASMR
during periods with low COVID deaths:
[<a href=connecticut.html#ASMR_by_vaccine_brand_and_month>connecticut.html#ASMR_by_vaccine_brand_and_month</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ct-asmrtype.png width=700>
</div>
<p>(As an aside, the plot above also shows that in the Connecticut data
people who got a Moderna vaccine for their first dose subsequently had
much lower ASMR than people who got a Pfizer vaccine for the first dose.
In the Czech record-level data it was the other way around so Kirsch
claimed that the Czech data proved that Moderna vaccines were somehow
more deadly than Pfizer vaccines. But I told him it was because of
confounders and that other countries would have different profiles of
confounders that would end up reversing the relationship, as was later
shown by the Connecticut data.)</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote that <span class="quote">"this Henjin-produced graph is
seriously flawed as explained in great detail
<a href=https://openvaet.substack.com/p/dunning-kruger-illustrated-asmr-explained>here</a>"</span>,
where he linked to a Substack post by canceledmouse who claimed that I
was calculating ASMR incorrectly. I addressed the post in detail here:
<a href=czech3.html#Reply_to_Substack_article_by_canceledmouse>czech3.html#Reply_to_Substack_article_by_canceledmouse</a>.</p>
<p>The reason why canceledmouse was not able to reproduce my ASMR
calculation was because he had 4 bugs in his Perl code. I was able to
fix all bugs by changing this line:</p>
<pre>$deaths_per_100k_ASMR = $deaths_per_100k * $standard_percent / $age_group_percent_of_total;</pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre>$deaths_per_100k_ASMR = $deaths_per_100k * $standard_percent / 100 * 365 / ($rolling_days + 1);</pre>
<p>When he calculated an 11-day moving average of deaths, he added
together the deaths on 11 days but he forgot to divide them by 11. And
the percentage of each age group in the standard population should've
been divided by 100 to get the fraction of the age group. And the deaths
per person-days should've been multiplied by 365 to get deaths per
person-years. And a division by <span class="quote">"age group percent
of total"</span> is not part of the formula for calculating ASMR.</p>
<p>He fixed the bugs after I pointed them out to him, and after that his
code produced mostly similar results to my code. The remaining
differences to my code were for two reasons. First I used the Czech 2021
census population as my standard population, but he used the WHO
standard population which has a low percentage of people in elderly age
groups so it's a very poor match to the Czech population structure. And
second I applied a moving average where the window extended 10 days
backwards and 10 days forwards to both deaths and population size, but
canceledmouse didn't apply a moving average to population size but he
only applied a moving average that extended 10 days backwards to deaths,
so his deaths were lagging 5 days behind the population size which
underestimated the ASMR of vaccinated people in early 2021 when the
vaccinated population size was increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>canceledmouse also claimed that my bucket analysis was done poorly,
but the only reason he gave was that I assigned a random birthday to
each person so he claimed my analysis was not reproducible. However he
didn't notice that I assigned a seed in my code before I generated the
random birthdays, and he corrected his error after I pointed it out to
him.</p>
<p>I think the only genuine error canceledmouse was able to find was
that when he ran my code for generating the plot for ASMR by vaccine
type, he got an extra gray line with the label <span
class="quote">"NA"</span>. However that was a line for Novavax that I
forgot to remove from the code on my website.</p>
<p>canceledmouse also claimed that I shouldn't have used the term ASMR
because I used the Czech 2021 census population as my standard
population, but it's not a standardized standard population like the WHO
standard population. However I explained why he was wrong in the page
under my previous link.</p>

<p>However a Reuters article said that the figure of 8% included people

<blockquote>
<p>According to ICAN, 7.7% of the v-safe users - 782,913 people -
reported seeking medical attention via a telehealth appointment, urgent
care clinic, emergency room intervention or hospitalization following a
COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>About 25% of v-safe users said they experienced symptoms that
required them to miss school or work or prevented them from doing other
normal activities, according to ICAN's <span
class="quote">"<a href=https://www.icandecide.org/v-safe>dashboard</a>"</span>
that summarizes the results.</p>
<p>There's no way, however, based on the information collected, to
determine whether the COVID-19 vaccines actually caused the ailments.
ICAN's analysis included responses reported beyond the first seven days
post-vaccine and <span class="red">it counted all reports of people
seeking medical attention up to a year after receiving the shot</span>.
ICAN did not specify when after vaccination they received the care, nor
did the data indicate what the care was for.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In the first week after getting the shot, the [CDC] spokesperson
continued, <span class="quote">"reports of seeking any medical care
(including telehealth appointments) range from 1-3% (depending on
vaccine, age group and dose)."</span></p>
<p>She pointed me to a
<a href=https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2822%2900054-8>report</a>,
looking at the first six months of v-safe data to back up the assertion.
In addition, another CDC spokesperson said that agency personnel made
follow-up calls to any v-safe users who reported seeking medical
attention.</p>
<p>But ICAN counsel Aaron Siri of Siri &amp; Glimstad, who led the FOIA
litigation against the agency, said that because some vaccine-related
adverse effects (chronic arthritis, thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barré
syndrome, myocarditis and more) can appear weeks after vaccination, it's
important to broaden the time frame beyond the one-week window in
research the CDC cited.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The data has its limits. The CDC asked v-safe users to self-report a
range of post-vaccine symptoms such as headache, joint pain and fatigue,
and (irrespective of whether they sought medical attention) to
categorize the ailments as mild, moderate or severe. The agency queried
v-safe users about their health every day for the first week following
vaccine, and then at various points afterwards for the next 12 months,
gathering a total of 146 million records.</p>

<p>The study linked above said: <span class="quote">"Reports of seeking
medical care after mRNA vaccine were rare; v-safe surveys did not ask
which symptoms prompted the participant to seek medical care."</span>
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8901181/>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8901181/</a>]
Table 5 of the study showed that about 0.8% of people <span
class="quote">"reported medical care"</span> within 8 days from
receiving the first dose. The same table shows that only about 0.03% of
people were listed as being hospitalized within 8 days from receiving
the first dose.</p>
<p>It's not even clear if the rate of 8% people seeking medical care
within a year is higher or lower than a baseline rate in the absence of
COVID vaccination.</p>

The German MoH soon deleted the tweet and posted a similar tweet next
day where the first sentence was changed to say: <span
class="quote">"The reporting rate for serious reactions <span
class="citation" data-cites="PEI_Germany">@PEI_Germany</span> is 0.2

A reply to the new tweet also said this in German: <span
class="quote">"The reporting rate refers to all suspected reports,
i.e. a causal connection with the vaccination is not yet confirmed with
the suspected report; a temporal connection is first
established."</span> And another reply said: <span class="quote">"In a
tweet from July 20, there was an incorrect formulation regarding the
reporting of suspected cases to the Paul Ehrlich Institute."</span></p>
<p>So the new thread clarified that the ratio in question was the rate
of reports for suspected adverse events, and not a rate of people who
<span class="quote">"suffer from serious side effects"</span> due to the
vaccines like Kirsch suggested.</p>
<p>The latest safety report by the Paul Erlich Institute was published
in March 2023, and it said this in German: <span class="quote">"By March
31, 2023, the Paul Ehrlich Institute had received a total of 340,282
reports of suspected cases of side effects or vaccination complications
following COVID-19 vaccines, of which 1,949 did not specify which
vaccine was used. In 56,432 cases, the suspicion of a serious
vaccination side effect was reported, of which 946 did not specify the
vaccine. At the same time, according to the Robert Koch Institute,
192,208,062 COVID-19 vaccinations were administered in Germany."</span>
[<a href=https://www.pei.de/DE/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/arzneimittelsicherheit.html>https://www.pei.de/DE/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/arzneimittelsicherheit.html</a>]
So at that point the ratio of serious reports per doses administered
would've been about 0.029% (from <code>56432/192208062</code>).</p>
<p>In a Czech dataset for adverse event reports up to July 4th 2023,
there were a total of 6,719 serious adverse event reports which was
about 0.038% of total doses administered up to that point, so it was
fairly similar to the German ratio:

<p>However the tweet didn't show what part of the ASMR was accounted for
by COVID deaths. In January 2021 COVID ASMR accounted for about 56% of
all-cause ASMR in the category <span class="quote">"First dose, less
than 21 days ago"</span>, but there was very low COVID ASMR in the
category <span class="quote">"Second dose, less than 21 days
ago"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/uk-ons3week-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>So it might be that the vaccine was not yet fully effective during
the first couple of weeks from vaccination, or that two doses offered
better protection than one dose.</p>
<p>However in my plot above even if you exclude the COVID ASMR that is
shown in black, there's still a big difference between the one-dose and
two-dose categories for non-COVID ASMR. It might partially be because
people with two doses have passed the <span class="quote">"healthy
vaccinee"</span> test twice so they might have lower mortality risk on
average than people with one dose who have only passed the test
once.</p>
<p>There's also an effect I'm calling the <span class="quote">"late
vaccinee effect"</span> where people who got vaccinated late
subsequently have higher mortality than people who got vaccinated during
the rollout peak. I have found the effect in Barry Young's New Zealand
data, the Czech record-level data, Kirsch's Medicare data from
Connecticut, and an English FOI request given to Clare Craig. The reason
for the <span class="quote">"late vaccinee effect"</span> might be if
for example people who got vaccinated late tend to be less conscientious
than people who got vaccinated on time, or if some people got vaccinated
late because they had an illness when the vaccine dose was rolled out.
So it might explain why in the ONS data people who got the first dose
late also have very high mortality. But for example people who got the
second dose in May 2021 might have already gotten the first dose in
January 2021, so in May 2021 people who have received the second dose
less than 21 days ago are not necessarily <span class="quote">"late
vaccinees"</span> to the same extent as people who had only gotten the
first dose less than 21 days ago in May 2021.</p>
<p>The next plot demonstrates the late vaccinee effect in a UKHSA FOI
response to Clare Craig. The black line shows the mortality rate among
people vaccinated during the week shown on the x-axis. In each age group
the black line is below the blue baseline on the week when the pink line
for new vaccine doses peaked, but the black line gradually climbs up
among the late vaccinees who got vaccinated after the rollout peak had
already passed (with the exception that the <span class="quote">"late
vaccinee effect"</span> seems to be missing from ages 20-29):

<div>
<img src=i/uk-three-phase-2.png width=900>
</div>
<p>From the next plot of the Czech record-level data, you can also see
that the early vaccinees who got the first dose in February to May 2021
subsequently had low excess mortality even in 2022, but there was
subsequently high excess mortality among the late vaccinees who only got
the first dose after the main rollout wave had already passed:

southern-hemisphere paper, Rancourt ignored how excess deaths had a much
better temporal correlation with COVID deaths than with the daily number
of vaccine doses administered.</p>
<p>When Rancourt calculated the figure of 17 million vaccine deaths, he
assumed that all excess deaths since vaccine rollout were due to the
vaccines:

<p>However in a recent paper titled <span class="quote">"Medical

class="quote">"strong evidence that respiratory infections were
dominantly (virtually entirely) associated with the excess all-cause

[<a href=https://correlation-canada.org/respiratory-epidemics-without-viral-transmission/>https://correlation-canada.org/respiratory-epidemics-without-viral-transmission/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the high-quality databases for the USA, there is a close match
between the weekly reported COVID-19 mortality and weekly excess
all-cause mortality, in the Covid period (2020-2022), including prior to
and during the vaccine rollouts (CDC, 2023).</p>
<p>To the degree that COVID-19 death assignation represents a serious
respiratory condition at death, and given the intricate weekly temporal
matching of the reported COVID-19 mortality and excess all-cause
mortality for up to 3 years in the USA data, this represents strong
evidence that respiratory infections were dominantly (virtually
entirely) associated with the excess all-cause mortality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Age-stratified data exposes a major weakness in Rancourt's approach
of temporally correlating spikes in deaths with vaccine rollouts. In his
paper about southern-hemisphere and equatorial countries, he included
the plots for Peru that are shown in the GIF file below, and he argued
that the spike in deaths in early 2021 was caused by the vaccines
because the spike roughly coincided with the rollout of the first two
doses in the oldest age groups.
[<a href=https://correlation-canada.org/covid-19-vaccine-associated-mortality-in-the-southern-hemisphere/>https://correlation-canada.org/covid-19-vaccine-associated-mortality-in-the-southern-hemisphere/</a>]
However the spike in deaths also occurred around the same time in
younger age groups even though younger age groups got vaccinated much
later than older age groups:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-peru-age-groups.gif width=600>
</div>
<p>In the 125-country paper Rancourt wrote that the Czech Republic had a
spike in deaths which coincided with the booster rollout. However I told
him that if you look at age-stratified data, deaths peaked around the
same time in all age groups even though vaccine doses peaked about a
month before deaths in ages 80+ and about a month after deaths in ages
40-59:
[<a href=czech.html#Daily_deaths_and_vaccine_doses_by_age_group>czech.html#Daily_deaths_and_vaccine_doses_by_age_group</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czrancourt.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In Rancourt's recent paper I believe he referred to the Czech
record-level data in the following paragraphs, where he now seems to
have admitted that the excess deaths that coincided with the booster
rollout could not be attributed to people who had recently received a
booster dose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, Rancourt et al. (in preparation) analysed national
mortality data in one country in which COVID-19 vaccination status was
known at death, including the history of COVID-19 vaccinations, in a
case in which the country exhibited rapid vaccine rollouts strongly
temporally associated with observed surges in excess all-cause
mortality. They found that relevant <span class="red">peaks in excess
all-cause mortality associated with booster rollouts could not
preferentially be assigned to booster-vaccinated individuals</span> (and
also that the vaccine had no detectable survival benefit).</p>
<p><span class="red">This means that the COVID-19 vaccination primary
cause described in Section 3.3.5 did not produce a measurable increase
in excess all-cause mortality in this country, which in turn means that
sharp peaks in excess all-cause mortality which are temporally
associated with rapid vaccine rollouts need not imply that COVID-19
vaccination is a primary cause of death.</span> Rather, it seems that
(as pervasive as they are) such temporal associations between mortality
peaks and rapid vaccine rollouts are due to the primary cause described
in Section 3.3.6 of campaigns and measures associated in time and place
with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts. Although non-conclusive in general, this
is consistent with the fact that the vaccine toxicity causing death
inferred from populationwide adverse-effect monitoring is usually too
small to be detected directly in populationwide (e.g., national)
cause-independent all-cause mortality, as per analyses of USA VAERS
(Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) data (Hickey and Rancourt,
2022).</p>
<p>This would mean that the lethality of medical measures imposed during
the Covid period and during vaccine rollouts is much greater than
generally acknowledged, and much greater than the known (VAERS,
autopsies, etc.) vaccine toxicity itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rancourt now has to perform circus-level acrobatics to reconcile his
earlier claim of 17 million vaccine deaths with his new claim that there
were not necessarily that many deaths associated directly with
vaccination. So he now appears to suggest that most of his 17 million
deaths were not caused directly by vaccination, but they were rather
caused indirectly by measures associated with vaccination or by
vaccination-induced stress, like the items I highlighted in yellow here:
[<a href=https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/did-the-c19-vaccine-kill-17-million>https://denisrancourt.substack.com/p/did-the-c19-vaccine-kill-17-million</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-rancourt-morris-3.png width=1100>
</div>
<p>However Rancourt's new hypothesis doesn't seem to explain why the
excess deaths were concentrated in waves that coincided with COVID
waves, and why the waves were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated
people even after adjusting for HVE. Why did vaccination-induced stress
kill unvaccinated people? And why was vaccination-induced stress less
likely to kill people during months when new vaccine doses were rolled
out than during months when there were COVID waves?</p>

<p>The undeniable rise in turbo cancers causing people to die of cancer

<p>He told me: <span class="quote">"My confidence is very high from my

I saw 6 people in one clinic. All had turbo cancers wanting a second

3-9 weeks of symptoms/diagnosis. My colleague surgeon James Royle has

<p>Professor Dalgleish has been doing this for more than 40 years. He
went from seeing 2 cases in 40 years to as many as 6/day after the COVID
shots rolled out which is a maximum rate increase of 43,800x. From a
Poisson perspective, he expected to see 2/(40*365) events in a day and
saw 6. The chance of that happening is 9.2e-27. What intervention could
cause turbo cancer in so many people? The only thing we know they all
had in common is recent COVID vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence for turbo cancer seems to be largely anecdotal, but
turbo cancer is nowhere to be found in actual cancer statistics.</p>
<p>The term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> appears to have
been introduced to the world during Arne Burkhardt's pathology
conference on September 20th 2021 UTC:
<a href=turbo.html#German_pathology_conference_held_by_Arne_Burkhardt>turbo.html#Pathology_conference_held_by_Arne_Burkhardt_and_Reiner_F_llmich</a>.
The people who did presentations during the conference suggested that
turbo cancer may have been caused by the various strange objects they
discovered in either vaccine samples or in the blood of vaccinated
people. For example one person claimed that he found eggs with worms
hatching out of them in a vaccine sample. And another person claimed
that a blood sample from a vaccinated person contained microchips and
synthetic fibers that may have been Morgellons.</p>
<p>Mathew Crawford used to be the main person who was helping out Kirsch
with statistical analysis along with Jessica Rose. But he had a falling
out with Kirsch because Kirsch was promoting too much dubious
information like the story about a new type of white clots seen by
embalmers. In 2023 Crawford tweeted: <span class="quote">"And
disinformation is an even larger issue. When I collapsed and stopped
spending 80+ hours a week doing analysis last year, I was pissed off and
angry that half the work I was doing was fixing the nonsense of people
like Kirsch. Cleaning the lines is a priority."</span>

Crawford shares my suspicion that Kirsch might be controlled opposition
who is intentionally producing disinformation. Crawford is now also
working on an article about how the turbo cancer narrative might be some
kind of a psyop, which is another view I share with him:

<p>After USMortality showed how cancer ASMR had been going down in the
United States since 2024, he got a similar treatment from his fellow
truth seekers as Crawford did when he busted disinformation about the
DMED military data:
[<a href=https://x.com/EduEngineer/status/1859385389246550191>https://x.com/EduEngineer/status/1859385389246550191</a>]</p>

<p>In December 2024 Jessica Rose tweeted <span class="quote">"We are
seeing a shit-ton of cancers since 2021"</span>, but USMortality showed
her that cancer ASMR had been going down since 2020 in the United
States:
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1866040763722657860>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1866040763722657860</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-turbo-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Then as evidence that there had been an increase in cancer mortality,
Jessica Rose cited a paper by Ed Dowd about cancer deaths in ages
75-84:</p>
<div>

<p>But I replied to her by posting the image below and I told her to

In Dowd's paper the reason why cancer CMR increased between 2020 and
2021 was because CDC WONDER used population estimates based on the 2010
census for 2020 but population estimates based on the 2020 census for
2021, but the population size of ages 75-84 was shifted downwards by
about 4% in the 2020-based population estimates. And the reason why the
cancer CMR increased between 2021 and 2022 was because Dowd's team
retrieved the data from CDC WONDER in 2023 when it still used 2021
population sizes for 2022, because the Census Bureau published the
population estimates for 2022 in June 2023 but they were only added to
CDC WONDER around January 2024. However the population size of ages
75-84 increased by about 7% between 2021 and 2022 because the baby
boomers started turning 75 around mid-2021:</p>

<p>Later I asked Jessica Rose again a few times if she could now cite
another source to back up her claim that there has been a <span
class="quote">"shit-ton of cancers since 2021"</span>, and I asked her
if she saw my critique of Dowd's paper and if she still thought Dowd's
paper showed there was an increase in cancer mortality. But she didn't
reply to me, until she just blocked me and said <span
class="quote">"you're trying to waste my time. and i bid you good day.
👀"</span>.

But if there was an actual epidemic of turbo cancer, then couldn't she
have cited a single paper which showed there was an increase in cancer?
Either incidence or mortality would have done. And in order to save time
she could've even sent me just a URL with no comment needed.</p>
<p>I have also asked Dowd to issue a correction to his paper multiple
times, but he has never responded to me.</p>
<p>Ed Dowd's group also published a paper about cancer mortality in
England and Wales in ages 15-44. They found a massive increase in cancer
deaths in 2022, but it was because they used an incorrect method to add
in deaths they thought were missing because of a registration delay.
They assumed that cancer deaths had the same proportion of missing
deaths as the overall proportion of missing deaths for all causes, but
in reality cancer deaths have a much shorter registration delay than
deaths from external causes, and a large part of all deaths in ages
15-44 are from external causes:

<p>I haven't found a single country that would've have a clear increase
above the pre-COVID trend in either cancer mortality or cancer incidence
since 2021.</p>
<p>In this tweet an anti-vaccine showed that the cancer deaths in
Scotland had been below the pre-COVID trend in 2022-2024 and only
slightly above the trend in 2021:

<p>The Twitter user Ethical Skeptic has published many fraudulent plots
of cancer mortality in the US. In the next plot he got the lowest cancer
ASMR in 2021 but after that his ASMR went up three years in a row.
However I was not able to reproduce his plot even though I tried many
different ways to calculate ASMR, and I always got lower ASMR in 2022
and 2023 than 2021, like what's shown by the red line I overlaid on top
of his plot here:
[<a href=ethical.html#SV40_cancer_wave_plot_for_cancer_ASMR_since_1950s>ethical.html#SV40_cancer_wave_plot_for_cancer_ASMR_since_1950s</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-historical-cancer-10.png width=800>
</div>
<p>Ethical Skeptic is notorious for applying various undocumented
adjustments to his plots. In the plot above he may have applied an
adjustment he calls <span class="quote">"excess MCoD
normalization"</span>, which means that he initially plots only deaths
with the underlying cause cancer, but from some hand-picked point
onwards he starts to add in a gradually increasing proportion of MCD
cancer deaths to his plot.
[<a href=ethical.html#Deaths_from_malignant_neoplasms_with_excess_MCD_normalization>ethical.html#Deaths_from_malignant_neoplasms_with_excess_MCD_normalization</a>]
He claims he needs to apply the adjustment because there was some kind
of a scheme where cancer deaths which should've been classified as UCD
were hidden under MCD to downplay cancer mortality. He has justified his
adjustment based on this plot which shows that the MCD to UCD ratio for
cancer deaths has remained elevated since 2020:
[<a href=https://theethicalskeptic.com/2025/01/03/the-state-of-things-pandemic/>https://theethicalskeptic.com/2025/01/03/the-state-of-things-pandemic/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The green-to-red line in Chart 5 below shows the CDC Wonder Excess
Attributions of underlying cause of death Cancer to multiple cause of
death Cancer, per week for the two years prior, as well as years-of and
years-post the pandemic. The dotted baseline is normalized from the
years 2018-2019, and indexed to the last 7 week average as compared to
those same 7 weeks of 2018/19, so it is not a <span
class="quote">'regression'</span>. Since this is a relative index, it
should exhibit no trend or growth rate (outside the context of Covid
mortality peak periods of course). The current excess of 321 deaths
reflects cancer deaths which are concealed from the underlying cause of
death ICD code, and must be added back into the mix in order to make
Excess Cancer Mortality comparable to its past baseline. We reconcile
this into Chart 6 below, applying it only after the pandemic period
ended.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-malignant-1.png width=900><br>
</div>
<p><strong>Chart 5 - Cancer Concealment by Excess MCOD
Attribution</strong> - stands at 394 concealed cancer deaths per week.
In this practice, cancers are moved from the underlying cause of death
line in
<a href=https://theethicalskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blank-Death-Certificate-CA-2021.png>Part
I of the death certificate</a>, to one of the multiple cause of death
lines above the UCoD line, <strong><em>in excess of past
practice</em></strong>. Once Covid has abated, this balance should trend
back to zero. It has not. Therefore, in order to capture the true cancer
mortality increase, these cancer deaths falsely attributed to Covid and
other underlying causes must be added back into the total in the Excess
Cancer Mortality chart below. These missing deaths are phased back in
from Week 10 of 2022 (point of large decline in Covid mortality)
onward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the x-axis in his plot above started from 2018, so you
couldn't see that the MCD to UCD cancer ratio had already been
increasing since around 2015, and extra MCD deaths above the trend since
2020 can be explained by deaths with MCD COVID:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-malignant-6.png width=600>
</div>
<p>After I asked Ethical Skeptic to extend the x-axis of his plot
further to the past, he posted this plot where he generated fake data
for 2017 based on the data for 2018:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-turbo-10.png width=700>
</div>
<p>After I busted him of posting the fake data, he added a note to his
plot which said: <span class="quote">"Note: Because Wonder does not
offer 2017 weekly data, 2017 data reflects the correct total for the
year but is a week-by-week apportionment by combined 2018/19 arrival
forms"</span>. I don't understand what it means. But from my magenta
crosses here which show the real monthly MCD to UCD ratio, you can see
that Ethical Skeptic's ratio in 2017 is too high, and my magenta crosses
show that there was an increasing trend in the MCD to UCD ratio in
2017-2019:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-excessmcdnote-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>The increasing trend in the MCD to UCD ratio might be due to an
increase in the survival rate from cancer, because there are now more
people who survive with cancer up to the point when they die from some
other cause. In the United States cancer ASMR has been decreasing faster
than the age-standardized incidence of cancer:
[<a href=https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21820>https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21820</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-malignant-9.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Ethical Skeptic has also posted many plots like this where there
appears to be an impressive increase in cancer mortality since 2021:
[<a href=https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1869942081684197426>https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1869942081684197426</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-turbo-11.jpg width=1200>
</div>
<p>However in the plot above almost all of his excess deaths are
explained by either excess MCD normalization where he shifts the
baseline upwards, or by PFE adjustment where he shifts the baseline
downwards. I have shown here why both of his adjustments are likely too
heavy:
<a href=ethical.html#Deaths_from_malignant_neoplasms_with_excess_MCD_normalization>ethical.html#Deaths_from_malignant_neoplasms_with_excess_MCD_normalization</a>,
<a href=ethical2.html#Should_the_PFE_adjustment_last_for_only_6_6_years>ethical2.html#Should_the_PFE_adjustment_last_for_only_6_6_years</a>.
Almost all of the excess deaths disappear if you look at my green lines
here where I didn't apply either adjustment:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-malignant-8.png width=1200>
</div>
<p>Out of many bad plots by Ethical Skeptic, the next plot is one of the
very worst. It is supposed to show that there has been a massive
increase in cancer incidence in the United States due to COVID vaccines:
[<a href=https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1676004521112117255>https://x.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1676004521112117255</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ethical-society-1.png width=700>
</div>
<p>However in reality the plot above shows projected estimates of cancer
incidence that are only based on real data only up to 2019. For example
his number of new cancer cases in 2023 is taken from Table 1 of this
report by the American Cancer Society:
<a href=https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2023-cancer-facts-figures.html.><a

class="uri">https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2023-cancer-facts-figures.html</a>.</a>
But a footnote to Table 1 says: <span class="quote">"Source: Estimated
new cases are based on 2005-2019 incidence data reported by the North
American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR)."</span> The
report also says: <span class="quote">"Importantly, the calculation of
these estimates is based on reported cancer incidence and mortality
through 2019 and 2020, respectively. Thus, projected cancer cases in
2023 do not account for the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic on cancer diagnoses, and the projected cancer deaths
in 2023 only account for the first year."</span></p>

<p>I wrote about Hulscher's paper here:

<p>Hulscher et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"Specifically, the number
of cardiopulmonary arrest deaths increased from 891 in 2015 to 1,110 in
2020, representing a 24.6% increase. In 2021, deaths jumped to 1,229 and
continued to rise to 1,310 in 2022. The projection for 2023 suggests
1,392 cardiopulmonary arrest deaths in King County, WA, indicating a
sharp 25.4% increase since the onset of COVID-19 vaccination
campaigns"</span></p>
<p>However in Hulscher's Table 1 the number of deaths in 2020 was 1121
and not 1110. But 1110 was his baseline value for 2020, so he seems to
have accidentally calculated the increase between 2020 and 2023 using
the baseline value instead of the number of deaths for 2020:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hulscher.png width=800>
</div>
<p>Hulscher's number of deaths actually increased from 1121 in 2020 to
1392 in 2023, so it was an increase of about about 24.2% and not 24.6%.
But his baseline also increased by about 12% from 1110 in 2020 to 1245
in 2023. So the excess deaths only increased by about 10.8 percentage
points (from <code>(1392/1245)-(1121/1110)</code>).</p>
<p>However his figure for 2023 wasn't even the real number of deaths but
a linear projection of the deaths in 2021 and 2022. The real number of
deaths in 2023 was published in September 2024 and it was 1358, so the
excess deaths between 2020 and 2023 increased by only about 8.1
percentage points relative to Hulscher's baseline (from
<code>(1358/1245)-(1121/1110)</code>.</p>
<p>McCullough's Substack article about the paper was titled <span
class="quote">"Peer-Reviewed Study Reveals 1,236% Surge in Excess
Cardiac Arrest Deaths Among 2 Million COVID-19 Vaccinated
Individuals"</span>. But <span class="quote">"among 2 million vaccinated
individuals"</span> meant among a population which consisted of about 2
million vaccinated people along with an unspecified number of
unvaccinated people. The data used by Hulscher didn't show if the people
who died were vaccinated or not, and it might be that unvaccinated
people were overrepresented among the people who died in excess since
many of the excess deaths seem to have been due to COVID. And the 1236%
increase was actually an increase from about 1.0% excess deaths in 2020
to about 11.6% excess deaths in 2023, so it was only an increase of
about 10.6 percentage points. Hulscher and McCullough seem to have
intentionally chosen a misleading headline, because they probably knew
that their followers would misinterpret the headline figure of a 1236%
increase:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-king-18.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The plot above also shows that Hulscher's 2015-2019 linear baseline
might have been too low in 2023, because the long-term trend in deaths
seemed to be curved upwards.</p>
<p>Hulscher's paper only included data going back to 2015 even though
the source where he took the deaths extended back to 2005. He might have
omitted earlier years because there was a big drop in the number of
deaths between 2014 and 2015, or because the earlier data would've
showed that the long-term trend in deaths was curved upwards so the
2015-2019 linear baseline was not necessarily accurate.</p>
<p>Hulscher used data published by King County emergency medical
services that showed the number of cardiac arrests the EMS responded to
which led to a death. So it includes deaths due to COVID, and it's
similar to data for cardiac arrest as a multiple cause of death where
deaths due to COVID are not excluded. But based on CDC WONDER's data for
King County, deaths with MCD COVID explain a large part of excess MCD
cardiac deaths since 2020, and there's only a low number of excess UCD
cardiac deaths since 2020:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-king-6.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Washington State had a low number of COVID deaths in 2020 relative to
2021 and 2022, so Hulscher's approach of using the year 2020 as the
baseline before vaccination but after COVID is not necessarily
accurate:</p>

<p>That's a huge negative impact. What was the error and what are the

<p>Similar analyses have also been done by Peter Hegarty, Raphael
Lataster, and Guyla Nagy:
<a href=statistic2.html#Excess_mortality_in_European_countries_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_people>statistic2.html#Excess_mortality_in_European_countries_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_people</a>.
But like Aarstad they all took excess deaths from Eurostat which uses
the average number of deaths in 2016-2019 as the baseline (even though
Hegarty also performed an alternate analysis using OWID's 2015-2019
linear baseline which is less inaccurate).</p>
<p>Eurostat's baseline exaggerates excess deaths in Western European
countries relative to Eastern European countries in 2022, because
Western European countries had a steeper increase in the yearly number
of deaths before COVID, and because Eastern European countries had a
greater reduction to population size due to excess deaths in
2020-2021.</p>
<p>In the next plot I calculated the green baseline by first doing a
linear regression for CMR in 2010-2019 for each age, and then I
multiplied a projection of the regression by the yearly population size
for each age to get the expected deaths for each age. So my green
baseline accounts for the aging population which produces an upwards
curve in the expected deaths per year in many countries, and it also
accounts for the reduction in population size due to excess deaths since
2020. But from the last two panels of my plot which show the average
values for Western European and Eastern European countries, you can see
that the green baseline is above the 2016-2019 average in Western
European countries but below the 2016-2019 average in Eastern European
countries:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-euro-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Another way to account for the changing age composition and reduction
in population size due to excess deaths is simply to calculate excess
ASMR. In the next plot the x-axis shows excess ASMR in 2022 relative to
a linear trend in 2013-2019 which is more accurate, and the y-axis shows
excess raw deaths relative to Eurostat's 2016-2019 baseline which is
less accurate, so you can see how Eurostat's baseline overestimates
excess deaths in Western European countries relative to Eastern European
countries:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-euro-4.png width=600>
</div>
<p>So when I calculated excess mortality using the 2013-2019 linear
trend in ASMR instead, I got negative correlation between excess
mortality in 2022 and the percentage of vaccinated people in 2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-euro-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Here when I used the same method to calculate excess ASMR, the
correlation in 2023 was also close to zero:</p>

<p>Jean Fisch is one of the top gurus on European COVID statistics on

So it said most deaths in general and not most excess deaths, which does
not exclude the possibility that most of the 40% excess deaths would've
been due to COVID.</p>
<p>On CDC WONDER during the second half of each year, ages 18-64 have
about 41% more deaths in 2022 than 2021, so it's in fact very close to

<p>On CDC WONDER if you calculate a ratio of deaths with UCD COVID in

ages 65 and above:</p>

<p>So why did working-age people have such a high percentage of COVID
deaths in 2021 relative to 2020? I think it's because in 2021
working-age people were less likely to be vaccinated than elderly
people.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2020-2021 the Czech Republic had a pattern of
mortality with three distinct humps, where in ages 80+ the first hump
was the highest and the third hump was the lowest, but ages 40-59
followed an opposite pattern. I think it's because by the time of the
third hump, the percentage of vaccinated people was over 50% in ages 80+
but less than 10% in ages 40-59:
[<a href=czech.html#Daily_deaths_and_vaccine_doses_by_age_group>czech.html#Daily_deaths_and_vaccine_doses_by_age_group</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-facet.png width=500>
</div>
<p>From the next plot for age-standardized hospitalization rate in the
Czech Republic, you can see that working age people had a high
hospitalization rate in 2021 relative to 2020 compared to elderly
people, but it's explained by a lower percentage of vaccinated people
among working-age people:
[<a href=czech3.html#Hospitalizations_by_age_group_and_vaccination_status>czech3.html#Hospitalizations_by_age_group_and_vaccination_status</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-hospvaxun-2.png width=500>
</div>
<p>If you are going to blame vaccines for the excess deaths in
working-age people in the second half of 2021, another problem is that
there were low excess deaths in northeastern states which had a high
percentage of vaccinated people, but there were high excess deaths in
southern states which had a low percentage of vaccinated people.
[<a href=statistic.html#Fabian_Spieker_US_summer_of_deaths_in_2021>statistic.html#Fabian_Spieker_US_summer_of_deaths_in_2021</a>].
A large part of the deaths also occurred during the Delta wave in August
to September 2021, even though there weren't that many new people
getting vaccinated at the time. And in some northeastern states like
Connecticut where the PCR positivity rate remained low in August to
September of 2021, there were also low excess deaths. If the wave of
excess deaths was due to vaccines then why did occur in some states but
not others even though all states got vaccinated?</p>
<p>Among the vaccinated people who are included in Kirsch's <span
class="quote">"Medicare all states subset"</span> spreadsheet, there was
also very little increase in deaths in August to September of 2021
relative to the general population of the US which also includes
unvaccinated people, so the bump in deaths during the Delta wave is
almost flat. Your old Medicare spreadsheet also shows that among people
in southeastern states who got vaccinated in the second half of 2021,
the number of deaths was not clearly elevated during the first few
months from vaccination. All of this is explained in more detail in my
previous link.</p>
<p>The number of additional working-age people who got vaccinated in the
third quarter of 2021 after the mandates is also fairly low compared to
the number of people who got vaccinated in the first half of 2021:
[<a href=statistic.html#Pierre_Kory_Excess_deaths_in_young_age_groups_in_the_fall_of_2021>statistic.html#Pierre_Kory_Excess_deaths_in_young_age_groups_in_the_fall_of_2021</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-kory-mandates.png width=700>
</div>
<p>So if the mandates caused a massive wave of deaths then why weren't
people also dropping like flies around March to May 2021 when a larger
number of people got vaccinated? The plot above also shows that the
spike in deaths in the third quarter of 2021 can mostly be attributed to
deaths where the underlying cause was listed as COVID. And the plot
above shows that part of the excess deaths in 2021 relative to 2019 can
be explained by deaths from drug overdoses.</p>

<p>Kirsch compared total ASMR in 2021 against total ASMR in 2020, but
the 2020 total also includes the months before COVID which reduces the
total ASMR for 2020. And a lot of the excess deaths in 2021 were in
January 2021 when there weren't yet that many people vaccinated.</p>
<p>Kirsch referred to a <span class="quote">"pull forward"</span> of
deaths, which is a term used by Ethical Skeptic for mortality
displacement where there's a reduced number of deaths after a period of
high excess deaths. But I think Ethical Skeptic exaggerates the
magnitude of the pull forward effect, and he uses the wrong method to
apply PFE adjustment to his baseline for expected deaths:
<a href=ethical2.html#Should_the_PFE_adjustment_last_for_only_6_6_years>ethical2.html#Should_the_PFE_adjustment_last_for_only_6_6_years</a>.
He applies the PFE adjustment to the baseline for only 6.6 years,
because he calculated that at some point the average age of people who
died from COVID in Florida was 82 years, and he got a life expectancy of
6.6 years for age 82 for males from a calculator at seniorliving.com.
However the life expectancy for females of age 82 was about 8.2 years on
the same website, so I don't know why he didn't even take the average
life expectancy for both males and females. And in the 2019 US life
table the life expectancy at age 82 was about 8.2 years for both sexes
combined. And at CDC WONDER the average age of UCD COVID deaths was
about 73.8 in Florida and about 73.9 in the whole US, so both are about
8 years lower than Ethical Skeptic's figure of 82 years.</p>
<p>When I took the life expectancies for each age from the 2019 US life
table and I calculated their average weighted by the number of UCD COVID
deaths for each age at CDC WONDER, the resulting life expectancy was
about 14.5 years. And if we assume that 14.5 years was the average life
expectancy of people who died from COVID, then even 14.5 years later
there would still be many people who would be alive if they hadn't died
of COVID. So the duration of the PFE adjustment should probably be much
longer than 6.6 years, which would also cause the average magnitude of
the PFE adjustment to be much lower because the adjustment would be
spread out over a longer period.</p>
<p>I did a simulation with two scenarios, where in both scenarios the
population size for each age started out as one tenth of the mid-2018 US
resident population estimates. I otherwise used a 2011-2019 linear trend
in CMR for each age in both scenarios, except in the other scenario I
multiplied the mortality rates in 2020-2021 to match the actual pattern
of excess deaths in the United States. But in the scenario with elevated
mortality in 2020-2021 I got only about 1.5% less deaths in 2022-2024
(see my previous link for details):</p>

<img src=i/ethical-sim.png width=600>

<p>USMortality also did similar simulations, but like me he got a much
lower reduction in deaths than in Ethical Skeptic's PFE-adjusted
baseline:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-pfe.png width=600>
</div>
<p>USMortality agrees with me that Ethical Skeptic's PFE adjustment is
too heavy, and he wrote <span class="quote">"I'd like to see actual
proof that PFE actually exists"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/USMortality/status/1857130356052488394>https://x.com/USMortality/status/1857130356052488394</a>]
But so far I believe he has not found good evidence for the kind of
heavy PFE hypothesized by Ethical Skeptic.</p>
<p>Ulf Lorré wrote that even in Bergamo where there was a massive number
of excess deaths in the spring of 2020, he didn't see a clear reduction
in deaths below the baseline afterwards in ages 75-84 but only in ages
85 and above:
[<a href=https://x.com/ULorre/status/1861170944204534073>https://x.com/ULorre/status/1861170944204534073</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-pfe-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Lorré compared ages 75-84 against ages 85 and above, but when I
compared ages 80-89 against ages 90+ instead, I didn't even see a clear
reduction in deaths below the baseline in ages 80-89 but only in ages
90+:
[<a href=nopandemic2.html#Should_NYC_and_Bergamo_have_reduced_deaths_due_to_a_pull_forward_effect>nopandemic2.html#Should_NYC_and_Bergamo_have_reduced_deaths_due_to_a_pull_forward_effect</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/np-bergamo-byage.png width=800>
</div>
<p>Many people have told Ethical Skeptic that if he would plot ASMR
instead of the raw number of deaths with PFE adjustment, then it would
account for the reduction in population size due to excess deaths in a
more straightforward and objective way than his PFE adjustment. But
Ethical Skeptic thinks ASMR is some kind of black magic and he usually
plots raw deaths without even adjusting for population size, and he
seems to have made up the shape of his PFE adjustment curve based on
some arbitrary subjective criteria. I have also told him to calculate
expected deaths using a method where first you calculate the prepandemic
trend in CMR for each age and then you multiply the population size of
each age by the projection of the trend. It allows plotting raw deaths
on the y-axis while still adjusting for the reduction in population size
due to excess deaths and for changes to the age composition of the
population, and it doesn't require you to pick any subjective magic
numbers for the magnitude or duration for the PFE adjustment. But so far
I have never seen him use that method either. But neither that method
nor ASMR produces nearly as heavy reduction in the expected mortality as
his PFE adjustment.</p>

<p>The article was about excess deaths in 2022 and not 2023, and it said
that Australia had about 20,000 excess deaths in 2022. At first I
thought they might have exaggerated excess deaths if they used a
prepandemic average baseline like the Australian Bureau of Statistics,
but at Mortality Watch a 2010-2019 linear baseline also gave me 19,135
excess deaths in 2022:
[<a href=https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=AUS&t=deaths&e=1&bf=2010&p=0>https://www.mortality.watch/explorer/?c=AUS&amp;t=deaths&amp;e=1&amp;bf=2010&amp;p=0</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-australia-1.png width=500>
</div>
<p>However the percentage of excess deaths in 2022 was only about 11%,
and as a whole Australia has had low excess mortality since 2020
compared to countries that were not able to keep the virus out with
lockdowns until the population was vaccinated.</p>
<p>And if the excess deaths were caused by the vaccines, then why wasn't
there already high excess mortality in 2021?</p>
<p>Most regions of Australia had negative seasonality-adjusted mortality
around the time in 2021 when people got the primary course doses. But
there was a sudden spike up in excess deaths around January 2022 which
coincided with a similarly sharp spike in PCR positivity rate, except in
Western Australia where the PCR positivity remained close to 0% in
January 2022, there was also no clear increase in excess deaths in
January 2022:</p>

<p>Kirsch also wrote: <span class="quote">"An excess deaths inquiry was

Watch above where I used a 2010-2019 linear baseline, the number of
excess deaths in Australia is 2,223 in 2021, 19,135 in 2022, and 7,846
in 2023, so almost none of the excess deaths were in 2021. And the total
excess mortality in 2021-2023 was only about 5.7%.</p>

<p>This plot from their Substack post showed that there was a positive
correlation between vaccination rate and excess deaths in 2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-advocate-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the Substack post Fenton and Neil got data for various variables
from OWID, but they didn't mention if they also got data for excess
deaths from OWID or from some other source. At first I thought the
excess deaths in their plot were based on the average value of the
<code>excess_mortality</code> column in the file
<code>owid-covid-data.csv</code>, but it did not match their plot.
However then I noticed that at the start of the post Fenton and Neil
wrote that their impetus for writing the post was to reproduce analysis
done by Igor Chudov. And Chudov took data for excess deaths from STMF,
and he calculated excess deaths relative to the average number of deaths
during the same week number in 2017-2019.
[<a href=https://www.igor-chudov.com/p/proven-relationship-covid-boosters>https://www.igor-chudov.com/p/proven-relationship-covid-boosters</a>]</p>
<p>So I believe Fenton and Neil used a method like this to calculate the
percentage of excess deaths for each country in 2022:</p>
<pre>&gt; s=fread(&quot;https://mortality.org/File/GetDocument/Public/STMF/Outputs/stmf.csv&quot;)[Sex==&quot;b&quot;]
&gt; s=merge(s,s[Year%in%2017:2019,.(base=mean(DTotal)),.(Week,CountryCode)])
&gt; s[Year==2022&amp;Week&lt;=44&amp;Sex==&quot;b&quot;,.(excesspct=(sum(DTotal)/sum(base)-1)*100),CountryCode][1:3]
   CountryCode excesspct
1:         AUS      17.2
2:         AUT       9.9
3:         BEL       4.8</pre>
<p>However most countries included in Fenton's plot were European, but a
prepandemic average baseline exaggerates excess deaths in Western
European countries relative to Eastern European countries, because
before COVID Western European countries had a more steep increase in the
yearly number of deaths on average, and in 2020-2021 the population size
was reduced more by excess deaths in Eastern European countries on
average.</p>
<p>In the next plot the green baseline addresses both shortcomings of a
prepandemic average baseline. From the last two panels, you can see how
in 2022 the prepandemic average baseline is too low compared to the
green baseline in Western European countries but too high in Eastern
European countries:
[<a href=statistic2.html#Excess_mortality_in_European_countries_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_people>statistic2.html#Excess_mortality_in_European_countries_compared_to_percentage_of_vaccinated_people</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-euro-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the middle panel of the next plot I calculated excess deaths
relative to a 2015-2019 linear baseline for raw deaths, which accounts
for the different slopes in deaths between countries before COVID, but
it does not account for the reduction in population size due to excess
deaths since 2020. But in the bottom panel I looked at excess ASMR which
also accounts for the reduction in population size. In the top panel
where I used a method similar to Fenton and Chudov to calculate excess
deaths, I got a correlation of about 0.45, but the correlation dropped
to about 0.11 in the middle panel which is likely more accurate and to
about 0.32 in the bottom panel which is likely the most accurate:</p>

<p>In the previous plot I took the excess ASMR percentages from this
file:
<a href=https://s3.mortality.watch/data/mortality/world_yearly.csv.><a
href="https://s3.mortality.watch/data/mortality/world_yearly.csv"
class="uri">https://s3.mortality.watch/data/mortality/world_yearly.csv</a>.</a>
The baseline for ASMR in the file is a linear regression in the range of
2010-2019 to 2015-2019 where the duration of the fitting period is
selected so that the error between the baseline and actual ASMR is
minimized.
[<a href=https://www.mortality.watch/about>https://www.mortality.watch/about</a>]
In the middle panel I took the average value of the
<code>excess_mortality</code> column for each country at OWID during
months in 2022 or weeks that ended in 2022.</p>
<p>In the previous plot I only included countries that had excess
mortality data available using all three methods in my plot. But when I
included all available countries for each panel instead, the correlation
dropped to 0.09 in the middle panel and -0.06 in the bottom panel:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-advocate-3.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the STMF dataset that was used by Chudov and Fenton, there's
columns for only deaths and crude mortality rate but not population
size, so in the next plot I tried using a new method of calculating
age-normalized excess mortality when age-specific mortality rates are
available but population size is not. For each country, I first
converted the weekly CMR values to yearly values by taking the yearly
average CMR of ISO weeks based on the year of the Thursday. Then I
divided the CMR for each age in 2022 with the average CMR in 2017-2019,
and then I took a weighted average of the resulting ratio where the
weight was the number of deaths for each age in 2022:</p>

mortality rates at STMF to calculate ASMR without having to know the
population size of the age groups. When I calculated excess ASMR in 2022

<p>Both of Kirsch's links went to the same Substack article. The article
said: <span class="quote">"However, it has come to light that the
committee buried the majority of submissions made to the Inquiry,
acknowledging only 59 (31.5%) of 187 submissions received on the

<p>The website about the inquiry has links to PDFs of the submitted
questions, but the links no longer seem to work (or perhaps they are not
available to visitors outside of Australia). However there's probably
many questions which were duplicates of other questions which might
explain why the committee didn't publish answers to all the questions,
or maybe the report produced by the committee was not long enough to
answer all questions.</p>
<p>The report about excess deaths was published by the Australian <span
class="quote">"Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs"</span>,
which has published on average about two similar reports per month.
[<a href=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Recent_reports>https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Recent_reports</a>]</p>
<p>The next report after the report about excess deaths was titled <span

The committee received a total of 285 submissions from various
organizations and individuals, but the report the committee published
was only 151 pages long so it didn't have room to include answers to
nearly all of the submissions. So maybe it's the common practice for
only a part of all submissions to be answered in these reports.</p>

FDNY fireman O'Brian Pastrana (was injured for life by the COVID vaccine
and can no longer work) testified on video that he personally observed a
10X increase in death rate right after the vaccines rolled out</a>. His
colleagues won't talk about it for fear of losing their job. He said
they saw 1 to 2 deaths a week before the shots rolled out, and it shot
up to 3 to 4 a day which is <strong>an astonishing 10X increase in death
rate after the COVID vaccine rollout.</strong>"</span></p>
<p>Kirsch linked to his interview of the fireman O'Brian Pastrana. The
fireman mentioned the increase in deaths starting at time 0:30 in the
video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong><em>Kirsch</em></strong>: And so what's interesting is what
he was seeing before he was retired - was that, he would, they would -
he would see like one death a week.<br> -
<strong><em>Fireman</em></strong>: Yeah, probably on average in a day in
a busy area.<br> - <strong><em>Kirsch</em></strong>: Before the vaccines
rolled out?<br> - <strong><em>Fireman</em></strong>: Before the vaccines
rolled out.<br> - <strong><em>Kirsch</em></strong>: Even through COVID,
all of that, one death a week?<br> - <strong><em>Fireman</em></strong>:
That's right.<br> - <strong><em>Kirsch</em></strong>: And what happened
after the jabs were rolled out?<br> - <strong><em>Fireman</em></strong>:
The uptick was - I mean, I'm not a mathematician, but three to four
times a day.<br> - <strong><em>Kirsch</em></strong>: Ok, I'm a
mathematician. So that is a 28 times, 28-fold increase. 28 times more
deaths in the same amount of time after the vaccines were rolled
out.<br> - <strong><em>Fireman</em></strong>: That's right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that Kirsch asked why other firemen weren't speaking out about
vaccine deaths if they were also seeing a massive number of deaths, but
the fireman O'Brian Pastrana answered that they were afraid of losing
their job. From the context of the video it was not fully clear if
Pastrana was seeing the deaths as part of his job or in his personal
life, even though Kirsch said that Pastrana was seeing the deaths before
he was retired, and Pastrana said that other firemen were also seeing a
lot of deaths, so I guess he was supposed to be seeing the deaths as
part of his job. But why would a fireman even see vaccine-related deaths
in their work? Wouldn't they be seeing fire-related deaths?</p>
<p>Pastrana's LinkedIn profile says that he worked as an EMT until 2013,
but from 2013 onwards he gave this description of his job: <span
class="quote">"To perform a wide variety of administrative and technical
tasks and functions in support of fire suppression, fire prevention,
hazardous materials, emergency medical and other emergency services; and
provide highly responsible prevention activities including crash fire
rescue, inspections, and security."</span>
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pastrana-o-brian-43b88897/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/pastrana-o-brian-43b88897/</a>]
So he wrote that he performed administrative and technical tasks in
support of emergency medical services, but it's not clear if he still
worked as an EMT who provided emergency services on the ground or not,
or if he still worked as an EMT in 2021. And even if he did work as an
EMT, doesn't a fire department EMT deal with fire victims and not with
people who have been injured by a COVID vaccine?</p>
<p>(Edit: I later found that in the comments of a New York Post article
about Pastrana, someone wrote: <span class="quote">"FD EMT here. I
treated a number of patients who were ultimately diagnosed with
myocarditis following the jab. The problem is a real issue, which needs
to be addressed."</span>
[<a href=https://nypost.com/2023/11/25/metro/fdny-vet-sues-for-disability-pension-after-covid-vax-reax/>https://nypost.com/2023/11/25/metro/fdny-vet-sues-for-disability-pension-after-covid-vax-reax/</a>]
But I still don't understand why a fire department EMT would be treating
COVID vaccine injury patients.)</p>
<p>O'Pastrana is supposed to have worked for the NYC fire department,
but he said there was an average of about one death per week in the
COVID era before the vaccines were rolled out. But in reality NYC had up
to about 7 times the normal number of weekly deaths in the spring of
2020, but subsequently NYC had relatively low excess deaths from summer
2020 onwards. Now of course a fireman wouldn't necessarily even be
witnessing people die from COVID in the spring of 2020, so the COVID
deaths in the spring of 2020 wouldn't necessarily have resulted in an
increase in the number of deaths seen by O'Pastrana. But why would a
fireman even be seeing deaths due to vaccines later on? And if NYC had a
10-fold or 28-fold increase in deaths in 2021, then why is it not
visible in mortality statistics?</p>
<p>Kirsch has published many similar anecdotes about how various
professionals have been seeing an increase in deaths since the vaccine
rollout, but in several other cases he has said that he received the
story from some anonymous source so it's difficult to verify his
stories. And often his anecdotes have seemed so implausible that I
suspect he has either made up his stories or his sources have fed him
fake stories.</p>
<p>In August 2024 Kirsch published a Substack post about an interview he
supposedly had with an anonymous military doctor. But he only published
notes of the supposed interview in his own words, so I don't know if the
doctor was even a real person or if the notes were just made up by
Kirsch.</p>
<p>Kirsch took down the post soon after he published it, because he said
that <span class="quote">"the doctor changed his mind and didn't want to
lose his job and he asked me to take it down."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1829554732861677628>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1829554732861677628</a>]
But it might have also been that Kirsch took down the post in case he
realized people would've figured out that the story was fake.</p>
<p>However the post about the military doctor can still be accessed via
a draft URL:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/22826d30-3ccc-4ecf-901f-30c3a598ae23.><a

class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/22826d30-3ccc-4ecf-901f-30c3a598ae23</a>.</a>
I also posted a PDF of the post here:
<a href=f/kirsch-military-doctor.pdf>f/kirsch-military-doctor.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>This table from the post showed the number of adverse events in the
<span class="quote">"last 2 years"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-militarydoctor-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Kirsch's post did not indicate what period of 2 years the table
referred to. So since Kirsch published the post in August 2024, did the
period of past 2 years refer to something like August 2022 to August
2024? In that case the doctor should've mentioned if the rate of adverse
events was higher in 2021 or in the first half of 2022, which were the
most relevant periods concerning the impact of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Kirsch wrote that the military doctor said: <span class="quote">"Not
a single vaccinated female has been able to give birth! 10/10 were
miscarriages."</span> However the table of adverse events above showed
that there had been 10 miscarriages in the 2-year period. So in the rest
of the post-vaccine era outside the 2-year period, were there also zero
births and zero miscarriages in vaccinated women?</p>
<p>The rate of 10 miscarriages out of 10 pregnancies also seems too
extreme. Based on CDC WONDER there hasn't been any clear increase in
miscarriages since 2021.
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/fetal.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/fetal.html</a>]</p>
<p>In Kirsch's table of adverse events in the last 2 years, there were 3
cases of blindness and 8 cases of brain fog. But was blindness really so
common that even brain fog was only about 2.7 times as common as
blindness? If 3 out of about 4,000 people on the base went blind because
of the shots, that would be the equivalent of about 250,000 people in
the whole US population, which would be a huge number even if it would
include temporary blindness. And Kirsch's table shows that even during
the 30-year baseline period the rate was only 1 for blindness and 3 for
high blood pressure, so why was high blood pressure only 3 times as
common as blindness?</p>
<p>Kirsch's post didn't say what period of time was used to calculate
the normal rate in the pre-vaccine era. If there was data available for
the exact number of adverse events during the 2-year period, then was it
also available for the entire period of time that was used to calculate
the normal rate? In that case why are the normal rates rounded to
integers? Or are the normal rates approximate estimates, or were they
the calculated from actual data but they were just rounded off to
integers?</p>
<p>Or do the normal rates simply show something like the total number of
adverse events on the base during a 30-year period? In that case Kirsch
should've mentioned that the normal rates are not necessarily accurate
in case the number of service members on the base had not remained at a
constant level of around 4,000 throughout the 30-year period.</p>
<p>Kirsch told me <span class="quote">"the doctor gave me his stats for
last 2 years vs. 30 years before the rollout. What THIS DOCTOR observed
first hand."</span> But in the Substack post Kirsch reported the doctor
as saying that he had worked for <span class="quote">"over 25 years as
an military doctor/medic"</span> and that <span class="quote">"I've been
doing this for over 25 years now"</span>. So if the doctor's data was
based on first-hand obervation, then how does he have data going back 30
years before the vaccine rollout if he hadn't even worked as a doctor or
medic that long?</p>
<p>Kirsch's post said that the doctor came to his unit in 2021. Did he
come to the unit from a different base or from a different unit on the
same base? Does the unit mean a medical unit, or does it mean a unit of
personnel he provides medical services for? Or does the base have
multiple medical units? Do the doctor's statistics apply to only his
unit or to all units? And if they only apply to his unit, then did he
extrapolate the figures of his unit to the entire base relative to the
size of his unit, or did he also acquire data about other units from
other doctors on the base? Or does he also have data about other units
that is somehow based on first-hand observation?</p>
<p>I asked these questions from Kirsch on DM but he wasn't able to
answer them. He wasn't even able to answer what 2-year period the rates
in his table referred to. He just said something like <span
class="quote">"are you accusing me of lying?!"</span> (Which is the
standard line people say when they are actually lying but they don't
have any argument to defend their lies.)</p>

<p>You can plainly see that with Moderna, you were <strong>worse off

<p>However the survival probability in Figure 1 is not adjusted for age.
Table S1 shows that during the period displayed in Figure 1, the average
age was about 45.6 for unvaccinated people, 45.0 for Janssen, 50.1 for
Sputnik, 56.9 for Moderna, and 57.9 for Pfizer. So it explains why the

<p>The plot above also shows that in Hong Kong, South Korea, and
Australia, the PCR positivity rate remained close to 0% until 2022, but
in 2022 there was a sharp spike in excess deaths which coincided with a
sharp spike in the PCR positivity rate. Why would vaccines not result in
excess deaths in 2021 but they would only result in a sharp spike in
deaths much later in 2022? In South Korea the spike did not even
coincide with the booster rollout because the booster rollout had peaked
about 3 months earlier.</p>
<p>Even in the second half of 2022 and in 2023, the spikes in deaths in
Singapore coincided with COVID waves:</p>

<p>Kirsch told me: <span class="quote">"I talked to my contact in

However from my plot above you can see that Singapore had a very low
number of COVID deaths until a sudden increase in October 2021, which
coincided with the first big increase in excess deaths. I didn't find
data for deaths in Singapore by age and month, but I suspect the spike
in deaths in late 2021 would've occurred around the same time in all age
groups even though older age groups got the booster earlier than younger
age groups.</p>

</div>
<p>Even though he used a 2015-2019 average baseline to calculate excess
deaths due to drugs, traffic accidents, and firearm use, he took the
overall number of excess deaths from a CDC dataset which used a
2013-2019 trend as the baseline. CDC's website said: <span
class="quote">"Counts of deaths in the most recent weeks were compared
with historical trends (from 2013 to present) to determine whether the
number of deaths in recent weeks was significantly higher than expected,
using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>]
So the CDC dataset took into account that in 2013-2019 there was an
increasing trend in deaths from drug overdoses and it assumed that the
trend would continue during COVID, which means that Wilf's 2015-2019
average baseline exaggerates the contribution of drug overdose deaths to
total excess deaths in the CDC dataset.</p>
<p>For example Wilf got 43,041 excess drug overdose deaths in 2022,
which was close to my figure here when I used a 2015-2019 average
baseline, but my number of excess deaths fell by more than half when I
used a 2013-2019 linear baseline instead:</p>

deaths from traffic accidents and firearm use, they were also much lower
than in Wilf's table. My remainder of unexplained deaths was much higher

<p>Wilf took the number of COVID deaths from OWID which in turn took it
from a dataset published by WHO.

The number of deaths in the WHO dataset doesn't match either MCD or UCD
COVID deaths at CDC WONDER, but it might be because the deaths in the
WHO dataset are by <span class="quote">"date reported to WHO"</span> but
deaths at CDC WONDER are by date of occurrence. The numbers in the WHO
dataset are also slightly off from the numbers listed at OWID, but I
think it's because OWID interpolated WHO's weekly data to daily data.
Here I converted the weekly deaths to yearly deaths based on the year of
the Thursday:</p>
<pre>&gt; who=fread(&quot;https://srhdpeuwpubsa.blob.core.windows.net/whdh/COVID/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv&quot;)

2022 260723 # 263401
2023  82031
2024  45580</pre>
<p>The WHO dataset appears to correspond to MCD rather than UCD deaths
at CDC WONDER, except the deaths in the WHO dataset seem to be reported
with a delay so that there's less deaths in 2020 and 2021 but more
deaths in 2022:</p>
<pre>&gt; v[cause==&quot;U071&quot;,.(ucd=sum(ucd),mcd=sum(mcd)),year]
   year    ucd    mcd # deaths at CDC WONDER and NVSS

2: 2021 416893 478402
3: 2022 186552 254355</pre>
<p>But anyway Wilf might have underestimated his remainder of
unexplained deaths because he looked at MCD rather than UCD COVID deaths
(even though UCD COVID seems to fall short of excess deaths during COVID
waves).</p>
<p>However CDC's estimate for excess deaths seems to be accurate, or at
least it's close to my estimate here where I multiplied the 2013-2019
trend in CMR for each age by the mid-year resident population estimate
for the age:</p>

<p>However he determined statistical significance based on whether the
yearly ASMR crossed above the upper end of the 95% PI or not. The
2017-2019 average baseline for ASMR is too high in most countries and it
often produces a very wide 95% prediction interval compared to a linear
regression baseline with a longer fitting period. So for example in
these plots for Sweden, the ASMR in 2020 crossed above the 95% PI when I
used a 2010-2019 linear baseline but not when I used a 2017-2019 average
baseline, and the average baseline also produced a very wide 95% PI:

<p>USMortality posted this plot for COVID ASMR by vaccination status at
OWID, which used data from a CDC dataset where partially vaccinated
people who had not finished the primary course doses at least 14 days
ago were excluded:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-usmortality-owid.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>However the plot only started from October 9th 2021, and there
weren't very many people who only received the primary course doses in
October 2021 or later so it didn't make much difference if people were
classified as vaccinated immediately after vaccination or not (even
though it may have made a bigger difference if people who had received
only one dose were excluded entirely).</p>
<p>But anyway in the Czech record-level data when I plotted all-cause
ASMR but I classified people as unvaccinated until 3 weeks from the
first dose, it gave an advantage to unvaccinated people because it
reduced the ASMR of unvaccinated people and it increased the ASMR of
vaccinated people (but in late 2021 the classification delay no longer
made much difference because there were few new people who got
vaccinated that late):
[<a href=czech4.html#ASMR_when_people_are_classified_as_unvaccinated_until_three_weeks_from_vaccination>czech4.html#ASMR_when_people_are_classified_as_unvaccinated_until_three_weeks_from_vaccination</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-cheap-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Similarly in Dutch CBS data, people who were not fully vaccinated had
lower COVID ASMR than unvaccinated people:
[<a href=https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/rapportages/2024/covid-vaccinatiestatus-en-sterfte/3-resultaten>https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/rapportages/2024/covid-vaccinatiestatus-en-sterfte/3-resultaten</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-usmortality-owid-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the next plot for the English ONS data, I plotted CMR in a single
age group instead of ASMR in all age groups, because I had to calculate
the mortality rate in the fully and not fully vaccinated people by
adding together multiple vaccination status groups, and it's not
possible to add together ASMR values when the population denominators
are not the same, but it is possible to calculate CMR for different
vaccination status groups combined by simply dividing total deaths
across different groups with total person-years. And the reason why I
picked the age group 80-89 was that it had the highest number of total
COVID deaths. But anyway, the next plot shows that in early 2021 people
who were not fully vaccinated had much lower COVID ASMR than
unvaccinated people, even though by late 2021 there was no longer much
difference because there were few new people getting vaccinated:</p>

<p>In the blog post USMortality linked to, he took the number of deaths
by vaccination status from a FOIA response which was missing population
sizes, so he had to estimate the population sizes of unvaccinated and
vaccinated people by merging the FOIA response with two other datasets
where the population sizes were completely unreliable:
<a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1804593333924442299.><a
href="https://x.com/henjin256/status/1804593333924442299"
class="uri">https://x.com/henjin256/status/1804593333924442299</a>.</a>
Me and Uncle John Returns also looked at the same FOIA data but we
concluded that it was not possible to calculate mortality rates based on
the response properly because accurate population sizes were not
available.</p>
<p>In this plot by USMortality if you look at the CMR in 2022 only, it's
over twice as high in unvaccinated people as vaccinated people in ages
0-20, 21-40, and 41-60, but ages 81+ follow the opposite pattern so
vaccinated people have about twice as high CMR as unvaccinated people.
That should've served as a basic sanity check to USMortality that his
population sizes were so inaccurate that he shouldn't even have
published his analysis:

<p>The plot above also doesn't match Barry Young's dataset, where in
2022 vaccinated people had lower CMR than the general NZ population in
all age groups shown above (even though unvaccinated people are
overrepresented at the lower end of the age groups which reduces
unvaccinated CMR relative to vaccinated CMR):</p>

<p>However there weren't very many people who only got their first
vaccine dose after January 2022. So one way the FOIA response can be
employed to estimate if the vaccines were effective or not is to look at
the percentage increase in deaths in March 2022 when New Zealand was
first hit by COVID. But for example in ages 81-100 between February and
March 2022, the number of deaths divided by days in month increased by
about 57% in unvaccinated people but only by about 16% in vaccinated
people:

<p>In his Substack post USMortality wrote that New Zealand <span
class="quote">"experienced no statistically significant excess mortality

ASMR didn't cross above the 95% PI when he used a 2017-2019 average
baseline. But the yearly ASMR would have crossed above the 95% PI if he
would've used a 2011-2019 linear baseline instead:

<p>Saar Wilf showed there was a negative correlation across US states
between the percentage of vaccinated people and mortality rate during
the Delta wave. Spiro Pantazatos pointed out that the correlation turned
positive after he adjusted for the number of COVID deaths in each state
in 2020:

href="https://telemimesis.substack.com/p/heres-to-you-dr-robinson"
class="uri">https://telemimesis.substack.com/p/heres-to-you-dr-robinson</a>.</a></p>
<p>I won't address his methodology here, but I'll show that unvaccinated
people had a much bigger increase in mortality during the Delta wave
than vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Kirsch had a source inside HHS who has given him a couple of
different sets of data from Medicare. Kirsch published the first set of
data in February 2023:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the?open=false#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received.><a
href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the?open=false#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received"
class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/game-over-medicare-data-shows-the?open=false#%C2%A7the-medicare-data-that-i-received</a>.</a>
And he published the second set of data in December 2023 at the same
time as Barry Young's New Zealand data:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new.><a
href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new"
class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new</a>.</a>
I wrote about both sets of data here:
<a href=moar.html#Connecticut_Medicare_data_published_by_Kirsch>moar.html#Connecticut_Medicare_data_published_by_Kirsch</a>.</p>
<p>The first set of data included data for both unvaccinated and
vaccinated people only for Connecticut, but it's not very useful to
determine the impact of vaccination during the Delta wave because
Connecticut had a very low number of deaths during the Delta wave.
However it includes another sheet for deaths in only vaccinated people
called <span class="quote">"Medicare all states subset"</span>, which
includes entries for a total of 114,157 deaths that occcurred between
December 2020 and January 2023. I don't know how the subset of people
was selected, and Kirsch doesn't seem to know it either because he
included this comment in his spreadsheet for the data: <span
class="quote">"Whatever query produced these records did NOT get all the
records for people who died since their vaccine. It seems like it is a
random subset of this data."</span></p>
<p>But anyway, the subset of people who were included in his Medicare
spreadsheet had almost no increase in deaths during the Delta wave:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-delta-1.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the second set of Medicare data that Kirsch published in December
2023, there was another spreadsheet which had one sheet for deaths by
date in unvaccinated people and and another sheet for deaths by date in
all people:
<a href=f/COVID_vax_jan_feb_mar_2021_plus_ALL_deaths_in_medicare_per_day.xlsx>f/COVID_vax_jan_feb_mar_2021_plus_ALL_deaths_in_medicare_per_day.xlsx</a>.
It was missing deaths by date in vaccinated people but I believe it's
possible to calculate deaths in vaccinated people by simply subtracting
unvaccinated people from all people like I did in the light red line
below. The spreadsheet also had sheets for deaths by days since
vaccination among people vaccinated in January 2021, February 2021, and
March 2021, but in the dark red line below I converted them to deaths by
estimated date of death by assuming that all people got vaccinated on
the 15th day of the month, which means that my estimated date of death
is off by at most 16 days from the actual date of death. However by both
methods of calculating deaths in vaccinated people, the bump in deaths
during the Delta wave was almost flat in vaccinated people:</p>

<p>In the plot above there's no new vaccinated people added to the dark
red line after April 15th 2021, so after that the dark red line
increases less steeply than the light red line, because the light red
line includes people vaccinated at any time so it even includes people
who only got the first dose in 2022, or who got the first booster dose
in 2022 but who didn't have records of primary course doses in the
Medicare database.</p>
<p>In the Medicare datasets Kirsch has published, there are many people
who are actually vaccinated but who are listed as unvaccinated because
they had no vaccine dose listed in the Medicare ddatabase. There are
also many people who were listed as unvaccinated until they got a
booster dose:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ct-uncle-2.jpg width=1000>
</div>
<p>In my previous plot the number of deaths in unvaccinated people goes
down a lot between late 2021 and mid-2022, but it's partially because
many people were listed as unvaccinated until they got a booster
dose.</p>
<p>Added later: Kirsch posted this reply to my comment to the Substack
post by Pantazatos: <span class="quote">"Medicare is OLD people. The

But I posted this reply to Kirsch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you know the increase was in vaccinated people? In the Czech
Republic the Delta wave only peaked around November to December 2021.
But if you look at ages 40-59, vaccinated people had almost no increase
in ASMR during the Delta wave, but the ASMR of unvaccinated people
almost doubled between September 2021 and the Delta peak:

<p>In the US in August to September 2021, ages 65+ accounted for about
