about half of COVID deaths incorrectly attributed to COVID?</a>
</h3>
<p>One of the issues that was brought up during the debate was if around
50% of deaths attributed to COVID were deaths that were deaths with
COVID but not primarily due to COVID.</p>
<p>In the United States the percentage of deaths with underlying cause
COVID relative to multiple cause COVID was about 88% in 2020, 87% in
2021, and 73% in 2022. So in the vast majority of deaths certificate
where COVID was mentioned anywhere on the certificate, COVID was listed
as the underlying cause of death:</p>
<pre>&gt; v=fread(&quot;curl -Ls sars2.net/f/vital.csv.xz|xz -dc&quot;)
&gt; v[cause==&quot;U071&quot;,.(ucd=sum(ucd),mcd=sum(mcd)),year][,ratio:=ucd/mcd][]|&gt;print(r=F)
 year    ucd    mcd     ratio
 2020 350831 397566 0.8824472
 2021 416893 478402 0.8714282
 2022 186552 254355 0.7334316
 2023  49932  77264 0.6462518</pre>
<p>The death record data that is used at CDC WONDER can be downloaded
from CDC's website as fixed-width text files.
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple</a>,
<a href=https://sars2.net/stat.html#Download_fixed_width_and_CSV_files_for_the_NVSS_data_used_at_CDC_WONDER>https://sars2.net/stat.html#Download_fixed_width_and_CSV_files_for_the_NVSS_data_used_at_CDC_WONDER</a>]
Unlike CDC WONDER, the fixed-width files show the list of causes of
death for each individual person, and they show which part and line of
the death certificate each cause appeared in. The total number of deaths
in the files is identical to CDC WONDER if you exclude overseas
territories and you exclude deaths among non-US residents.</p>
<p>For example in the year 2021, both the fixed-width files and CDC
WONDER have 416,893 deaths with the underlying cause of death U07.1
(COVID). But 314,103 or about 75% of the death records also had one of
these respiratory-related ICD codes: J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified), J80
(Adult respiratory distress syndrome), J96.0 (Acute respiratory
failure), J96.9 (Respiratory failure, unspecified), or R09.2
(Respiratory arrest):</p>

<p>And there are probably many other cases where a person died due to a
respiratory illness, but COVID was the only respiratory-related cause of
death that was listed on the death certificate.</p>
<p>The causes of death in a US death certificate are divided in two
parts, where part 1 consists of the causes of death which directly led
to the death, and part 2 consists of contributing conditions. The first
line of part 1 is intended to contain the <span class="quote">"immediate
cause of death"</span>, which is the final event which occurred right
before the death. The second line of part 1 is meant to show the
condition which triggered the immediate cause of death, and the third
line is meant to show the condition which triggered the condition on the
second line, and so on. The underlying cause of death is the condition
which triggered the cascade of events that led to the death. If for
example the conditions in the record below were filed in the order of
causality, then the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest, which
was caused by acute respiratory failure, which was caused by pneumonia,
which was caused by the underlying cause of death COVID:</p>
<pre>Age 52, UCD U07.1 COVID-19:
Part 1, line 1: I46.9 Cardiac arrest, unspecified
Part 1, line 2: J96.0 Acute respiratory failure
Part 1, line 3: J18.9 Pneumonia, unspecified
Part 1, line 4: U07.1 COVID-19

Part 2: E11.9 Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, withou...
Part 2: E66.8 Other obesity
Part 2: I69.4 Sequelae of stroke, not specified as haemorrhag...</pre>
<p>However often the causes of death in part 1 are not filled in
following an order of causality, like for example here where it looks
like respiratory failure triggered chronic kidney disease which
triggered COVID:</p>
<pre>Age 65, UCD U07.1 COVID-19:
Part 1, line 1: U07.1 COVID-19
Part 1, line 2: N18.5 Chronic kidney disease, stage 5
Part 1, line 3: J96.9 Respiratory failure, unspecified</pre>
<p>Or here it looks like cardiac arrest triggered respiratory arrest
which triggered COVID:</p>
<pre>Age 57, UCD U07.1 COVID-19:
Part 1, line 1: U07.1 COVID-19
Part 1, line 2: R09.2 Respiratory arrest
Part 1, line 3: I46.9 Cardiac arrest, unspecified</pre>
<p>CDC's guidelines for filling COVID death certificates mention that
it's a common error that the causes of death in part 1 are not listed in
the order of causality:
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf</a>]</p>

<img src=i/rootclaim-cdcguideline.png width=400>
</div>
<p>But anyway, when I selected 10 random people who died with underlying
cause COVID in 2021, 8 of the people also had some other
respiratory-related ICD code included in part 1 of the death
certificate. The immediate cause of death was listed as COVID among 4
people, respiratory failure among 3 people, and adult respiratory
distress syndrome among 2 people.</p>
<p>For example the first person shown below has cancers of rectum,
mouth, and pharynx listed as contributing causes of death in part 2, but
in part 1 the underlying cause is listed as COVID, which led to
pneumonia, which led to adult respiratory distress syndrome as the
immediate cause of death:</p>

<p>On the list above there is only one death certificate where COVID was
the only listed cause of death. Some people have made claims like that
98% of death certificates include some other cause of death besides
COVID, which means that only 2% of people died only due to COVID and no
other cause. However typically even if the only known cause of death
would be COVID, a death certificate might still list COVID as the
underlying cause of death, pneumonia as an intermediate cause of death,
and respiratory failure as the immediate cause of death.</p>
<p>CDC's guidelines for filling a COVID death certificate says: <span
class="quote">"If COVID-19 played a role in the death, this condition
should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is
likely that it will be the UCOD, as it can lead to various
life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on
the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it
gave rise listed on the lines above it."</span>
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf</a>]
The same document by CDC also says that pneumonia is imporant to report
on a death certificate: <span class="quote">"Pneumonia is important to
report in a cause-of-death statement but, generally, it is not the UCOD.
The cause of pneumonia, such as COVID-19, needs to be stated on the
lowest line used in Part I."</span></p>
<p>Denis Rancourt claimed that because pneumonia was listed as a cause
of death in more than half of US death certificates with UCD COVID, it
meant that <span class="quote">"more than half of the deaths assigned as
COVID-19 deaths could include life-threatening co-occurring bacterial
pneumonia"</span>.
[<a href=https://sars2.net/nopandemic2.html#Denis_Rancourt_Did_over_half_of_death_certificates_for_COVID_refer_to_bacterial_pneumonia>https://sars2.net/nopandemic2.html#Denis_Rancourt_Did_over_half_of_death_certificates_for_COVID_refer_to_bacterial_pneumonia</a>]
However Rancourt misinterpreted the ICD code J18.9 (<span
class="quote">"Pneumonia, unspecified"</span>) to mean bacterial
pneumonia, even though CDC's guidelines specifically say that pneumonia
caused by COVID is important to list on the death certificate. But an
ICD code specifically for bacterial pneumonia was only included in about
2% of all US death certificates with underlying cause COVID. [ibid.]</p>
<p>In the year 2021 there were 462,193 deaths where COVID was listed
anywhere on the death certificate:</p>
<pre>&gt; l[code==&quot;U07.1&quot;,length(unique(id))]
[1] 462193</pre>
<p>But in only about 10% of the death certificates COVID was listed in
part 2 of the certificate, which means that COVID was considered to have
contributed to the death but not be part of the primary sequence of
events which led to the death:</p>
<pre>&gt; l[line==6&amp;code==&quot;U07.1&quot;,length(unique(id))] # line 6 is part 2 and lines 1-5 are lines of part 1
[1] 44859</pre>
<p>Some people seem to think that COVID is commonly listed as a cause of
death for people who die from external causes like car accidents or drug
overdoses. However I found only 2,279 people who died in 2021 with UCD
external causes but MCD COVID:</p>

<p>In the output above the second person had the underlying cause of
death <span class="quote">"Sequelae of motor-vehicle accident"</span>
but the immediate cause of death acute respiratory failure. So maybe
they got COVID while they were hospitalized after a traffic accident and
the COVID contributed to their death.</p>
<p>The first and third person above seem to have died of an overdose of
recreational drugs and the fourth person seems to have died of a head
injury, so none of them should probably not be counted as COVID deaths.
However cases like that are probably not too common, since only about
0.5% of MCD COVID deaths in 2021 had UCD external causes.</p>

SYMPTOM_TEXT: See continuation page o Jan 2018 Mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung/brain/lymph node cancer o Feb 25th: Mom was brought to ER for a respiratory issue.  Full set of tests were done, nothing was found and she was sent home.  ER was happy she was going to see her primary the next day for follow up. o Feb 27th:  Mom woke up feeling ok, by afternoon she was too weak to walk and brought back to the ER.  Lungs shown with pneumonia and inflammation.  Mom was admitted to ICU that evening. o Feb 28th:  Mom seemed ok in ICU, but oxygen demands increased. o Mar 1st:  Mom was placed on bi-pap o Mar 2nd:  Mom was placed on vent o March 8th:  Mom fought back and was able to come off vent o March 12th:  Due to lack of rooms in ICU (from my understanding), Mom was moved to medical  o March 13th:  Mom expressed pain behind knee (maybe referred pain due to bleeding noted on the 14th) o March 14th:  Mom had severe side pain, blood work indicated potential internal bleed.  Hours later a CT scan was done and confirmed bleeding.  Plan was to give her plasma and maybe other drugs to hopefully stop the bleed (that doesn&#39;t make complete sense to me, but I&#39;m not a doctor).  Mom said she &quot;Felt like she was dying&quot;.  The nurse said that given Mom&#39;s condition, it would be best that someone spend the night with her.  I relieved my sister around 8:30 that night.  Mom was receiving plasma and whole blood.  I asked the nurse if her blood pressure and pulse were monitored at the nurses station, she said no but she would come in every hour to check (note additional checks were done every 15 minutes  when a blood transfusion was started).  Mom&#39;s door was closed due to 4 other psych patients on the floor making a lot of noise, so I was the only one to hear alarms.  Mom was too weak and couldn&#39;t press the nurse button when her side pain increased after 10 pm.  I pushed the button for her, a couple minutes later a nurse came on the intercom wondering what Mom needed, and  what felt like 10 minutes later a nurse arrived.  Around 11:15 pain meds were administered but didn&#39;t have any impact initially.  I questioned whether Mom should be in the ICU given the internal bleed, pain, and number of units of blood/plasma she was receiving (in my mind she was critical enough not to be on a medical floor where there is a high patient to nurse count and no continuous monitoring of vitals).   o March 15th The on call doctor came in around 12:30 am, I think, after pain meds started to settle Mom.  His first words, which I felt were said in a stern way, were &quot;I hear you want your Mom moved to ICU&quot;.  I expressed my concerns and that I was just trying to do what was best for Mom.  His voice softened and he said there is nothing more that ICU can do.  My impression was that he stated they would give more blood and if vitals drop, then move her to ICU.  Nurse came back in after the doctor left (note I felt the nurse did a great job that night) and said the doctor wanted her to discuss with me re-evaluating whether Mom should be a full code... It is very confusing since I felt the doctor was saying she was stable enough to stay on the medical floor, but then have the full code reconsidered at 1:00 in the morning by family...  I was in full tears after she left, didn&#39;t sleep, and said a few rosaries.  At 3:30 am Mom was moved to ICU.  By 6 or 7 am Mom had received 5 units of blood and 5 units of plasmas, which I believe is as much as the body can hold...   Around 7:15 am there was a clear indication on the monitor that Mom&#39;s blood pressure was dropping linearly over last hour.  Her breathing over night was 18 and normal, but increased to over 20 was very labored.  Her heart rate went from 90s to 114.  I walked over to ICU nurse with tears and there is a scary trend happening, do I need to call family in.  She stated that &quot;Mom is in the right place and no need to call family&quot;.  But took no action to correct decline.  Her only action was to get zophrane (or similar drug) since Mom was nauseous.  It wasn&#39;t until after the doctor came in after 8:15 am that the decision was made to transport.  At that point family was allowed to come in 1 by 1.  It was also the same time that the snow storm started and Mom had to go by ambulance, which by time coordinating wass complete didn&#39;t happen until 11 am.  Mom was given blood pressure medication which helped initially, but by time Mom reached it we were told her blood pressure was 37/19.  It feels if action was taken over night, Mom could have been flown and the blood pressure might not have dropped that far.  Mom&#39;s procedure was successful to stop bleeding. o March 16th:  We were told that given the amount of fluid Mom&#39;s lungs were starting to fill with fluid again and given low blood pressure on arrival, her kidneys were shutting down.   o March 17th:  Mom was placed on hospice o March 18th:  Mom was brought home o March 26th:  Mom went peacefully to heaven

</h3>
<p>The topic of turbo cancer was brought up during the debate. Earlier I
showed that cancer ASMR in the United States has gone down each year
since 2019.
[<a rhfe=rootclaim.html#Undeniable_rise_in_turbo_cancer_4c>rootclaim.html#Undeniable_rise_in_turbo_cancer_4c</a>]
I haven't found data on whether rapidly developing cancers have become
more common since 2021 in the United States, but it has not been the
case in Germany according to the head of the German Center for Cancer
Registry Data.</p>
<p>I believe the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was
first introduced in the German pathology conference held by Arne
Burkhardt in September 2021. The term was specifically used by the
lawyer Elmar Becker, who conveyed an anecdote about turbo cancer from
the German alternative medical practicioner Ute Kr√ºger.
[<a href=turbo.html>turbo.html</a>] Kr√ºger later participated herself in
Burkhardt's second pathology conference.</p>
<p>Ute Kr√ºger claims that she is able to employ <span
class="quote">"energy field technology"</span> to detect imbalances in
the energy field which is the <span class="quote">"non-material part
through which the body and soul communicate"</span>.
[<a href=https://active-health.se/sv/metod>https://active-health.se/sv/metod</a>]</p>
<p>Another speaker at Burkhardt's conference was Alex Bolland, who runs
a quack doctoring practice at a spa where he employs techniques like
kirlian photography, homeopathy, bioresonance therapy, and psychosomatic
energetics.
[<a href=https://www.bollants.de/en/natural-medicine/felke-med/concept?item=91ba70e0-1a4f-4184-a18c-658ef29e543d>https://www.bollants.de/en/natural-medicine/felke-med/concept?item=91ba70e0-1a4f-4184-a18c-658ef29e543d</a>]
He said that vaccines contain graphene oxide, mini-robots, and a
parasite called <em>Treponasoma cruzi</em>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bolland.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Another speaker in the conference was Uta Langer, who claimed that
the image below showed a synthetic fiber she found in the blood of a
vaccinated person, and when another person asked if it was a Morgellons
fiber, Langer answered that she didn't know if it was Morgellons or
not:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Ute Kr√ºger was presented as an early expert about turbo cancer in the
alternative media, so when I searched for the oldest BitChute videos
that matched the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>, 7 out
of the 10 oldest videos were videos by her.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=turbo+cancer&sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=turbo+cancer&amp;sort=old</a>]</p>
<p>In 2024 the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung published a
reader-contributed article about turbo cancer by Kr√ºger.
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/corona-impfstoffe-pathologin-warnt-diese-mrna-technik-ist-nicht-ausreichend-getestet-li.2259438>https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/corona-impfstoffe-pathologin-warnt-diese-mrna-technik-ist-nicht-ausreichend-getestet-li.2259438</a>]
In the article the main form of turbo cancer she focused on was breast
cancer in young women.</p>
<p>Her evidence that there had been an increase in breast cancer in
young women was largely anecdotal, but she also referred to analysis by
Ed Dowd's group Phinance Technologies. She wrote this in German: <span
class="quote">"A
<a href=https://phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/UK%20Cause%20of%20death%20Project%20-%20Malignant%20Neoplasm%20Deaths%2015-44%20-%20Individual%20Causes.htm>study</a>
from the UK in October 2023 examined the cancer mortality rate of 15- to
44-year-olds. These are very young people for whom cancer has previously
been a rare cause of death. It was found that there was a 28 percent
increase in cancer deaths from breast cancer in women in 2022."</span>
But the reason why Dowd's group found an increase in cancer deaths in
2022 was that they used an incorrect method to add in deaths they
thought were missing because of a registration delay, because they
assumed that cancer deaths had the same proportion of missing deaths as
the overall proportion of missing deaths for all causes, even though in
reality cancer deaths have a much shorter registration delay than deaths
from external causes, and Dowd's group looked at cancer deaths in ages
15 to 44 where a large part of all deaths are due to external causes:
[<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1783797036749402598>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1783797036749402598</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-turbo-7.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Later the German newspaper published a response to Kr√ºger's article,
which pointed out that her anecdotal evidence of a rise in turbo cancer
was not supported by actual cancer statistics:
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/corona-impfstoffe-und-turbo-krebs-was-die-fallzahlen-aus-deutschland-verraten-li.2262993>https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/corona-impfstoffe-und-turbo-krebs-was-die-fallzahlen-aus-deutschland-verraten-li.2262993</a>,
translated from German]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cancer registry shows that for a decade, between 72,600 and
75,6000 women in Germany have been diagnosed with breast cancer each
year. In 2022, around 74,500 women in Germany received the news that
they had the disease.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The number of breast cancer diagnoses is not increasing among younger
women either. Around 11,000 women between the ages of 30 and 49 in
Germany are diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time every year.
The number has been stable for many years - and it remained stable in
2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, whether the risk of dying from breast cancer is increasing
for individual patients can be better determined using the so-called
age-standardized mortality rate. How many patients out of 100,000 do not
survive their disease in a year? In 2018, the figure was 12.4 out of
100,000, and in 2023 - after the pandemic and vaccination campaign -
only 11.5 out of 100,000 died.</p>
<p>The same applies to all types of cancer taken together: the absolute
number of cases has been rising slightly for years. But if you take into
account the ageing of society, the mortality rate is falling
continuously, most recently from 147.6 per 100,000 cancer patients in
2018 to 137.5 per 100,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At the request of the Berliner Zeitung, the Center for Cancer
Registry Data therefore looked even deeper into the figures and, in
addition to the registry data and the cause of death statistics, also
evaluated the hospital data, particularly on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Here, too, the German data show no development that gives cause for
concern: <span class="quote">"We find no evidence of a higher incidence,
a higher mortality rate or an increased aggressive tumor behavior that
could be linked to the vaccination,"</span> says Klaus Kraywinkel, head
of the center.</p>
<p>The proportion of women with a poorly differentiated -
i.e.¬†particularly malignant - tumor was a good 29 percent of all breast
cancer patients in the years 2018 to 2020. In 2021 and 2022 it even fell
slightly, to just over 28 percent. Poor differentiation could be an
indicator of particularly aggressive growth. So far, here too: all
clear.</p>
<p>The picture did not change in terms of the diagnosed tumor sizes
either. In 2018, doctors classified the tumor in six percent of the
affected women as being in the <span class="quote">"T3"</span> category
and in seven percent as being in the <span class="quote">"T4"</span>
category - these are the two largest types of tumor. In the following
years, these proportions remained unchanged - including in 2022.</p>

of COVID deaths averted by vaccination based on English ONS data</a>
</h3>
<p>The primary topic of the Rootclaim debate is whether vaccines saved
or killed more people in the United States in the years 2020-2022. As
far as I know, there is only public dataset available for COVID
mortality in the United States that is grouped by vaccination status,
age, and date, but the dataset it only starts from October 2021. So in
order to estimate the number of COVID deaths averted by vaccination
since the start of 2021, I looked at English data instead.</p>
<p>The UK Office for National Statistics has published datasets which
show the number of COVID deaths in England grouped by vaccination
status, age group, and month:
<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023.><a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023"
class="uri">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023</a>.</a>
I otherwise used data from the final 9th edition of the dataset, except
it was missing the first 3 months of 2021 so I took them from the 7th
edition of the dataset.</p>
<p>In the following code for each combination of age group and month, I
calculated the COVID mortality rate in unvaccinated people and I
multiplied it with the population size of vaccinated people, which gave
me the expected number of COVID deaths in vaccinated people if they
would've had the same COVID mortality rate as unvaccinated people. I got
a total of about 294,951 expected deaths when I added together the
expected deaths across all months and age groups. But the actual number
of deaths in vaccinated people was only 58,256, so my calculation gave
me about 236,695 deaths averted by COVID vaccination:</p>
<pre># CSV version of tables 1 and 2 of ONS spreadsheets (only table 2 is used here)
t=fread(&quot;http://sars2.net/f/ons.csv&quot;)

# the 7th edition was the last edition that included the first 3 months of 2021
t=t[ed==9|(ed==7&amp;month&lt;=&quot;2021-03&quot;)]
t=t[cause==&quot;Deaths involving COVID-19&quot;&amp;age!=&quot;Total&quot;]

# combine groups for different dose numbers into a single group for all vaccinated people
a=t[,.(dead=sum(dead),pop=sum(pop)),.(month,age,vax=status!=&quot;Unvaccinated&quot;)]

# add column for baseline mortality rate in unvaccinated people
me=merge(a[vax==T],a[vax==F,.(month,age,base=dead/pop)])

# get expected vaccinated deaths by multiplying vaccinated population size with unvaccinated baseline rate
me[,.(actual_dead=sum(dead),expected_dead=sum(pop*base))]
#    actual_dead expected_dead
# 1:       58256      294950.9</pre>
<p>In my calculation I used different baseline mortality rates for each
month, so I took into account how different variants were associated
with different mortality rates and how unvaccinated people acquired
natural immunity over time. From the first table in the image below, you
can see that the baseline COVID mortality rates were much lower at the
end of the observation period than at the beginning. And from the last
table you can see that in 2021 the baseline number of COVID deaths at
unvaccinated mortality rates was about 6 to 12 times higher than the
actual vaccinated number of deaths, but by 2023 the ratio had dropped to
about 2, which is likely because unvaccinated people acquired natural
immunity over time:</p>

<p>One of the many limitations of my calculation is that it is not
adjusted for the healthy vaccinee effect. Even in a counterfactual
scenario where no vaccines were ever administered, the kind of people
who in reality chose to get vaccinated would've probably had lower
age-specific COVID mortality rates than the kind of people who chose to
remain unvaccinated. Uncle John Returns found that compared to the
most-vaccinated regions of England, the least-vaccinated regions already
higher excess all-cause ASMR in 2020.
[<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1744742449036337365>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1744742449036337365</a>]</p>
<p>But anyway, my calculation applied to the period from January 2021 up
to May 2023, so it included essentially the entire period since vaccine
rollout when there was substantial COVID mortality. My calculation only
included ages 18 and above, and it was missing people who were not
included in the census-linked dataset of the ONS, so there was a total
of about 97 million person-years during the 29-month observation
period:</p>
<pre>&gt; a[,sum(pop)]
[1] 97175073</pre>
<p>Over the same 29-month period of time, the US resident population in
ages 18 and above had about 627 million person-years:</p>
<pre>uspop=fread(&quot;https://sars2.net/f/uspopdeadmonthly.csv&quot;)
&gt; uspop[age&gt;=18][year%in%2021:2023&amp;!(year==2023&amp;month&gt;5),sum(persondays)/365]
[1] 626550748.2</pre>
<p>So if I simply multiply 236,695 COVID deaths averted in the UK with
the ratio of US to UK person-years, I get a figure of about 1.5 million
COVID deaths averted by vaccination in the United States:</p>
<pre>&gt; 236695*626550748.2/97175073
[1] 1526126</pre>
<p>I did not adjust my calculation to account for the different
percentage of vaccinated people in England and the US or for the
difference in age structure.</p>

of COVID deaths averted by vaccination in the United States</a>
</h3>
<p>In the previous section I estimated the number of COVID deaths
averted by vaccination in England, but here I apply the same method to
data for the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC has published a dataset which shows the number of COVID
deaths by week, age group, and vaccination status:
<a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/54ys-qyzm.><a

class="uri">https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/54ys-qyzm</a>.</a>
The CDC dataset only covers the time period from October 3rd 2021 to
April 1st 2023. Partially vaccinated people are also excluded, because
the dataset only includes unvaccinated people and people who had
received the second dose at least 2 weeks ago. The dataset also includes
only a subset of US jurisdictions, so the total population size included
in the dataset ranges from about 107 million to 130 million depending on
the week.</p>
<p>This shows COVID mortality rate by week and age group in the CDC
dataset:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-cfr-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the CDC dataset there is a total of 55,978 COVID deaths in
vaccinated people and 76,295 COVID deaths in unvaccinated people. In the
code below I calculated that if vaccinated people would've had the same
COVID mortality rate as unvaccinated people for each combination of week
and age group, there would've been a total of 525,747 COVID deaths in
vaccinated people, which is almost 10 times higher than the actual
number of COVID deaths in vaccinated people:</p>

<p>So even though my calculation included only a bit over a third of the
US population and it only applied to the period of October 3rd 2021 to
April 1st 2023, I still got a figure of 469,769 COVID deaths averted by
vaccination (from <code>525747-55978</code>).</p>
<p>On CDC WONDER the total number of deaths with underlying cause COVID
was 292,316 in the period of October 3rd 2021 to April 1st 2023, 304,643
in earlier weeks of the MMWR year 2021, and 269,871 between April 2nd
2023 and February 28th 2025.
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>]
So the period included in the CDC dataset only accounted for about 33.7%
of all COVID deaths since the start of the MMWR year 2021.</p>
<p>The average weekly number of people included in the CDC dataset is
about 120 million, which is about 36.0% of the average US resident
population estimate between October 2021 and March 2023:</p>
<pre>t[,sum(vaccinated_population+unvaccinated_population),mmwr_week][,mean(V1)] # 119884655

us=fread(&quot;http://sars2.net/f/uspopdeadmonthly.csv&quot;)
us[date&gt;=&quot;2021-10&quot;&amp;date&lt;=&quot;2023-03&quot;,sum(pop),date][,mean(V1)] # 333297623</pre>
<p>So I got 469,769 deaths averted by vaccination in a subset of about
36.0% of the US population that was observed for a period that accounted
for about 33.7% of all COVID deaths in the post-vaccine era. The
calculation <code>469769/.360/.337</code> would give about 3.9 million
COVID deaths averted by vaccination in the entire US population since
the start of 2021. My estimate might be too high, because I didn't take
the healthy vaccinee effect into account, and I didn't take into account
that in early 2021 there were not yet as many people vaccinated as
during the time period included in the CDC dataset. And I also didn't
take into account that unvaccinated people acquired natural immunity
over time, so compared to the period included in the CDC dataset, the
ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated COVID mortality was earlier
higher but later lower (even though I'm not sure if adjusting for
natural immunity would increase or reduce my estimate for the number of
lives saved by vaccines).</p>

<p>Kirsch has an anonymous source at HHS who has given him several sets
of data from Medicare, which includes a spreadsheet that shows the
number of deaths by days since vaccination among people who were
vaccinated in 2021:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new.><a

class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new</a>.</a></p>
<p>Kirsch published the spreadsheet on his S3 server in December 2023,
but I uploaded the spreadsheet here so it's easier to download:
<a href=f/COVID_vax_jan_feb_mar_2021_plus_ALL_deaths_in_medicare_per_day.xlsx>f/COVID_vax_jan_feb_mar_2021_plus_ALL_deaths_in_medicare_per_day.xlsx</a>.</p>
<p>In the spreadsheet there is a very low number of deaths in the first
days following vaccination due to the healthy vaccinee effect. The
average number of deaths is about 1,763 on days 0 to 6 since vaccination
but about 4,047 on days 100 to 365 since vaccination:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-vaersmed.png width=800>
</div>
<p>The spreadsheet also shows the daily number of deaths in unvaccinated
people (which includes people who were actually vaccinated but who had
no vaccination record known to Medicare):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-vaersmed-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>In the spreadsheet there is a total of 2,787,479 deaths in the year
2021, out of which 1,395,511 deaths were in unvaccinated people or
people with no known vaccination record, so about 50% of all deaths are
in unvaccinated people. However deaths in unvaccinated people are
missing from January 2021, so if January is excluded then about 54% of
all deaths in 2021 are in unvaccinated people (which again includes
people with no known vaccination record).</p>
<p>Medicare is generally only available to people aged 65 and above, but
it is also available to younger people who have certain medical
conditions or disabilities. About 98% of the US population aged 65 and
above is enrolled on Medicare.</p>
<p>At CDC WONDER there are 2,494,699 deaths among US residents aged 65
and above in 2021, which is actually about 11% lower than the number of
deaths in the Medicare spreadsheet. The extra deaths in the Medicare
spreadsheet might be due to people under the age of 65, people who live
in overseas territories like Puerto Rico, or people who are not US
residents. People in overseas territories like Puerto Rico are eligible
for Medicare but they are excluded from the mortality data at CDC
WONDER. Non-US residents are also excluded from CDC WONDER but they may
be eligible for Medicare if they have a work history in the United
States.</p>
<p>But anyway, the spreadsheet of the Medicare data has such a low
number of deaths in the days after vaccination that there are only
12,344 people who were vaccinated in 2021 but who died 0 to 6 days from
vaccination.</p>
<p>In contrast when I excluded non-US reports at VAERS, there were a
total of 3,497 reports for people whose vaccine type was listed as
COVID-19, whose vaccination date was in 2021, and whose date of death
was within 0 to 6 days from vaccination:

<p>So if you divide 12,344 by 3,497, the Medicare spreadsheet has only
about 3.5 times more people who died within 0 to 6 days from vaccination
than VAERS. So it doesn't seem to leave room for a 40-fold
underreporting factor proposed by Kirsch (unless the proportion of
unreported deaths is much lower during the first week from vaccination
than during later weeks, or unless the underreporting factor is lower
for reports that involved a death than other reports, or unless the
underreporting factor was lower in 2021 than subsequent years).</p>
<p>In the Medicare spreadsheet the date of vaccination is the date of
the earliest known vaccine dose, so if for example someone got the
second dose 21 days after the first dose and died on the same day, it
will be listed as a death 21 days after vaccination and not 0 days after
vaccination. So if for example people on Medicare who received one or
more vaccine doses in 2021 received on average 2 doses in 2021, and if
the risk of dying in the week after the second and third doses was
similar to the risk of dying in the week after the first dose, then the
actual number of deaths on the week of vaccination might be twice as
high as the figure listed in the spreadsheet. But even if you multiply
the number of deaths on the week of vaccination in the Medicare
spreadsheet by 2, it's still only about 7 times higher than the number
of people who died on the week of vaccination at VAERS.</p>
<p>The Medicare spreadsheet is missing deaths in people who were not
enrolled on Medicare, which includes most people under the age of 65.
And the spreadsheet is also missing the number of days between
vaccination and death for people who had no vaccination record known to
Medicare. But the spreadsheet still probably includes data for the time
between vaccination and death for the majority of US residents who died
after being vaccinated in 2021, because on CDC WONDER ages 65 and above
account for about 72% of all deaths in 2021.</p>
<p>The number of people who were vaccinated in 2021 and who died on the
day of vaccination was 426 at VAERS and 738 in the Medicare spreadsheet,
so the number of deaths in VAERS is about 58% of the number of deaths in
the spreadsheet. On the day after vaccination the ratio increases to
about 67% because there's 906 deaths in VAERS and 1344 deaths in the
Medicare spreadsheet. However on subsequent days the ratio gradually
gets lower, until during days 50 to 300 it stabilizes around the range
of 1-2%, even though after day 300 the ratio falls even further:</p>

<p>Kirsch has been saying that the CFR went up in the US in the first
months after the vaccine rollout which shows that the vaccines were not
effective.</p>
<p>Normally CFR is calculated by comparing an aggregate statistic for
the number of cases by date against an aggregate statistic for the
number of deaths by date, so the cases have to be shifted forwards or
the deaths have to be shifted backwards to account for the delay between
case onset and death. For example in the US nursing home data shown
below, there was an upwards trend in CFR during the first 8 weeks of
2021 when I didn't shift the cases, but it changed to a downwards trend
when I shifted the cases forwards by 3 weeks:</p>

</div>
<p>So based on the nursing home data, whether CFR went up or down in the
first two months after the vaccine rollout depends on how many weeks the
cases are shifted forwards.</p>
<p>However the CDC has published a dataset which has one row for each
COVID case with a total of about 106 million rows, where there's one
column for the date of each case and another column which indicates
whether the case resulted in a death or not:
<a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf/about_data.><a
href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf/about_data"
class="uri">https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf/about_data</a>.</a>
So the CDC dataset makes it possible to calculate CFR without having to
shift the cases. But it shows that the percentage of cases that resulted
in a death went down each month between December 2020 and March 2021,
which contradicts Kirsch's claim that the CFR went up after the vaccine
rollout:</p>

<p>The plot above also shows that ages 80+ and 70-79 had higher CFR in
late 2020 than during the Delta wave, but the age groups between 20-29
and 50-59 had much higher CFR during the Delta wave than in late 2020,
which might be because the younger age groups had a much higher
percentage of unvaccinated people during the Delta wave than the older
age groups.</p>
<p>In the next table the drop in CFR between December 2020 and March
2021 was the highest in ages 80+ and 70-79 which already had a high
percentage of vaccinated people by March 2021, but the drop was much
lower in ages 30-39 and 40-49:</p>

<p>The death record data in NVSS that can be queried through CDC WONDER
has been published here as fixed-width text files:
<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm.><a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm"
class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm</a>.</a>
At CDC WONDER the number of deaths is suppressed on rows with 1 to 9
deaths but the deaths are not suppressed in the fixed-width files, so
the files are useful for analyzing data for rare causes of death like
vaccine-related deaths.</p>
<p>I came up with the list below of ICD codes that are potentially
related to vaccine injury, but my list is probably missing some codes.
Relative to a 2015-2019 average baseline, the NVSS files have about 130
extra deaths in 2021 for the code T88.1 (<span class="quote">"Other
complications following immunization, not elsewhere classified"</span>),
140 for T88.7 (<span class="quote">"Unspecified adverse effect of drug
or medicament"</span>), 193 for Y59.0 (<span class="quote">"Viral
vaccines"</span>), and 13 for Y59.9 (<span class="quote">"Vaccine or
biological substance, unspecified"</span>). However many death records
include two or more of the codes. For underlying cause of death, the
maximum yearly number of deaths for any of the codes shown below was 2
before 2021, but in 2021 there were 66 deaths with underlying cause
Y59.0 (<span class="quote">"Viral vaccines"</span>) and 5 deaths with
the underlying cause Y59.9 (<span class="quote">"Vaccine or biological
substance, unspecified"</span>):</p>

<p>So there seems to have been a genuine increase in vaccine-related
deaths in 2021, even though it might be partially because more vaccines
were administered in 2021 than in earlier years.</p>
<p>There were 66 death records in 2021 with the underlying cause Y59.0
(<span class="quote">"Viral vaccines"</span>), but the following code
shows the complete list of causes of death for a subset of 8 random
records. In the case of 5 of 8 records the immediate cause of death was
T88.1 (<span class="quote">"Other complications following immunization,
not elsewhere classified"</span>), but for the three other records the
immediate causes were listed as cardiac arrest, anaphylactic shock, and
R99 (which is used for unknown or undefined causes of death):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one of the most important revelations of the pandemic,

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirsch wrote that <span class="quote">"the disparity happened during
non-COVID periods as well"</span>. But the study by Arbel et al.¬†did not
even compare mortality during a COVID period and a non-COVID period. The
study lasted from August 6th 2021 until September 29th 2021 which
coincided with the Delta wave, so there was high COVID mortality in
Israel during the entire period of the study.
[<a href=https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/covid?Metric=Confirmed+deaths&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&country=~ISR>https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/covid?Metric=Confirmed+deaths&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;country=~ISR</a>]</p>
<p>The paper by Arbel et al.¬†said: <span class="quote">"Death due to
Covid-19 occurred in 65 participants in the booster group (0.16 per
100,000 persons per day) and in 137 participants in the nonbooster group
(2.98 per 100,000 persons per day)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624>https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624</a>]
But <code>2.98/0.16</code> is about 19, so even though the 2-dose group
was younger than the 3-dose group, the 2-dose group is still supposed to
have had about 19 times higher crude COVID mortality rate, which doesn't
seem right.</p>
<p>H√∏eg et al.¬†calculated that based on the numbers provided by Arbel et
al., people with 2 doses had about 19 times higher crude non-COVID
mortality rate than people with 3 doses, so the ratio between the crude
non-COVID mortality rates was close to the same as the ratio between the
crude COVID mortality rates. H√∏eg's response to Arbel's paper said:
<span class="quote">"However, using the person-days of exposure included
in the 2021 article by Arbel et al.¬†and the deaths not related to
Covid-19 reported in the subsequent letter, we estimated the mortality
not related to Covid-19, according to vaccination status, with the
following formula: the ratios of total deaths not related to Covid-19 to
Covid-19-related deaths, according to vaccination group, multiplied by
mortality due to Covid-19, according to vaccination group, which
accounts for person-days of exposure. The mortality not related to
Covid-19 was calculated as (441/65)√ó0.16=1.09 per 100,000 persons per
day in the booster group as compared with (963/137)√ó2.98=20.95 per
100,000 persons per day in the nonbooster group."</span>
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683</a>]</p>
<p>Arbel et al.¬†responded to H√∏eg that after adjusting for variables
like age, SES, and comorbidities, the hazard ratio for non-COVID deaths
was only about 4 times higher in the 2-dose group than the 3-dose group:
<span class="quote">"With adjustment for the same covariates that were
included in the analyses of Covid-19-related death in our article, the
adjusted hazard ratio for death not due to Covid-19 was 0.23 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.26) among participants who received
the booster (Table 1), a finding that is 2.3 times as high as the
adjusted hazard ratio for death due to Covid-19 (hazard ratio, 0.10; 95%
CI, 0.07 to 0.14)."</span> [ibid.]</p>
<p>Arbel's Table 1 shows that the average age was about 4 years younger
in the 2-dose group than the 3-dose, and the 2-dose group generally had
a lower or similar level of comorbidities as the 3-dose group. So it
doesn't makes sense that the 2-dose group got about 19 times higher
crude non-COVID mortality rate than the 3-dose group but only about 4
times higher adjusted hazard ratio for non-COVID mortality, because
adjusting for age and comorbidities should've magnified the difference
in mortality between the groups and not made it smaller. The 2-dose
group had lower SES than the 3-dose group, but SES had little effect on
the hazard ratio in Arbel's model.</p>
<p>Arbel's paper says: <span class="quote">"A total of 843,208
participants met the eligibility criteria, of whom 758,118 (90%)
received the booster during the 54-day study period. Death due to
Covid-19 occurred in 65 participants in the booster group (0.16 per
100,000 persons per day) and in 137 participants in the nonbooster group
(2.98 per 100,000 persons per day)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624>https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624</a>]
So if you reverse engineer the observation time by dividing the COVID
deaths by the COVID deaths per person-days, the observation time is
about 4,597,315 person-days in the 2-dose group (from
<code>137/2.98*1e5</code>) and about 40,625,000 person-days in the
booster group (from <code>65/0.16*1e5</code>). So the 2-dose group
accounts for only about 10.2% of total observation time, which is nearly
the same as the percentage of participants who did not get a booster
during the study period which is about 10.1%
(<code>1-758118/843208</code>).</p>
<p>Arbel's response to H√∏eg said: <span class="quote">"With regard to a
potential healthy vaccinee bias, all participants in our study started
at an <span class="quote">'unboosted'</span> status, which was changed
to a <span class="quote">'boosted'</span> status 7 days after
vaccination, and 9 of 10 participants contributed follow-up data in both
statuses (i.e., to both the booster group and the nonbooster
group)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683</a>]
So even if all subjects would've gotten the booster dose on the first
day of the study, the subjects would've still contributed observation
time to the two-dose group for the first 7 days after vaccination, but 7
days is about 13% of the entire study period of 55 or 54 days. (The
study lasted from August 6th 2021 until September 29th 2021 which is 55
days inclusive of both the starting and ending date, but the duration of
the study was reported as 54 days by Arbel, which might be if for
example the study started and ended on the same hour of the day, or if
the study started and ended during working hours so the duration was
closer to 54 than 55 full days, or it might also be that Arbel et
al.¬†made an error in calculating the duration of the study period. But
regardless <code>7/54</code> and <code>7/55</code> are both about 13%,
which is higher than my reverse engineered percentage of observation
time in the 2-dose group out of total observation time.)</p>
<p>So anyway, I think Arbel et al.¬†made an error in calculating the rate
of COVID deaths per 100,000 person-days, so that the subjects
contributed person-days to the 3-dose category and not the 2-dose
category even in the days before the subjects got a 3rd dose. Otherwise
it's not realistic that the 2-dose group would account for only about
10.2% of total person-days.</p>
<p>Next in order to verify if Arbel's adjusted odds ratios were
consistent with other datasets, I tried to calculate similar odds ratios
in the English ONS data.
[<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023</a>]
I included only ages 50 and above like Arbel, but I looked at the last 4
months of 2021 instead of only August and September 2021, since the UK
took longer than Israel to reach high booster coverage.
[<a href=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-booster-doses-per-capita?country=ISR~GBR>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-booster-doses-per-capita?country=ISR~GBR</a>]
I adjusted the odds ratio only for the variables of age group and
observation month since data for comorbidities was not available.
Relative to a baseline of people with 2 doses, people with 3 doses had
an odds ratio of about 0.08 for COVID deaths, 0.25 for non-COVID deaths,
and 0.23 for deaths from all causes (so the results are similar to Arbel
who got an odds ratio of about 0.10 for COVID deaths and 0.23 for
non-COVID deaths):</p>
<pre>t=fread(&quot;http://sars2.net/f/ons.csv&quot;)
t=t[ed==9&amp;age%like%&quot;^[5-9]0&quot;&amp;month&gt;=&quot;2021-09&quot;&amp;month&lt;=&quot;2021-12&quot;]
a=rbind(t[status%like%&quot;Second&quot;][,dose:=2],t[status%like%&quot;Third&quot;][,dose:=3])
a=a[,.(dead=sum(dead),pop=sum(pop)),.(month,age,dose,cause)]

lm=glm(dead~dose+month+age+offset(log(pop)),poisson,a[cause==&quot;Deaths involving COVID-19&quot;])
exp(coef(lm))[2] # 0.07899472

lm=glm(dead~dose+month+age+offset(log(pop)),poisson,a[cause==&quot;Non-COVID-19 deaths&quot;])
exp(coef(lm))[2] # 0.2457514

lm=glm(dead~dose+month+age+offset(log(pop)),poisson,a[cause==&quot;All causes&quot;])
exp(coef(lm))[2] # 0.2315978</pre>
<p>But in the English data the crude non-COVID mortality rate was only
about 1.2 times higher in people with 2 doses than people with 3 doses
(and not about 19 times higher like in H√∏eg's calculation):</p>
<pre>a[cause==&quot;Non-COVID-19 deaths&quot;,.(cmr=sum(dead)/sum(pop)*1e5),dose]|&gt;print(r=F)
# dose      cmr
#    2 2329.769
#    3 1953.398</pre>
<p>Next I calculated a similar odds ratio in the Czech record-level
data, so that I again included ages 50 and above and I looked at the
last 4 months of 2021, and I calculated a mortality risk adjusted for
age group and observation month. People with 3 doses had an all-cause
mortality risk of about 0.28 relative to people with 2 doses:</p>
<pre>b=fread(&quot;http://sars2.net/f/czbuckets.csv.gz&quot;)[,age:=pmin(age,100)%/%5*5]
b=b[month&gt;=&quot;2021-09&quot;&amp;month&lt;=&quot;2021-12&quot;&amp;age&gt;=50]

a=b[dose==3,.(dead=sum(dead),pop=sum(alive),dose=3),.(month,age)]
a=rbind(a,b[dose==2,.(dead=sum(dead),pop=sum(alive),dose=2),.(month,age)])
a[,age:=factor(age)]

lm=glm(dead~dose+month+age+offset(log(pop)),poisson,a)
exp(coef(lm))[2] # 0.2806021</pre>
<p>But the all-cause crude mortality rate was only about 1.3 times
higher in people with 2 doses than people with 3 doses:</p>
<pre>a[,.(cmr=sum(dead)/sum(pop)*365e5),,dose]|&gt;print(r=F)
# dose      cmr
#    2 2548.217
#    3 1997.901</pre>
<p>So Arbel's odds ratios seem to be consistent with other datasets but
Arbel's crude mortality rates are not.</p>
<p>Kirsch pointed out that relative to people with 2 doses, people with
3 doses had about 94.6% lower crude COVID mortality rate and about 94.8%
lower crude non-COVID mortality rate, so therefore Kirsch concluded that
the difference in COVID mortality rate between the 2-dose and 3-dose
groups was explained by the HVE. But his conclusion was wrong because
the crude mortality rates were calculated wrong. Kirsch should've
compared Arbel's adjusted hazard ratios instead, which were about 0.10
for COVID deaths and 0.23 for non-COVID deaths.</p>
<p>Kirsch claimed that the booster vaccination did not reduce COVID
mortality risk because the difference in COVID mortality between the
3-dose and 2-dose groups was explained by the HVE. But a problem with
his claim is that the 3-dose group had a similar COVID mortality risk as
the 2-dose group during the first 7 days after vaccination. Arbel et
al.¬†wrote: <span class="quote">"The hazard ratio for death due to
Covid-19 in participants up to 7 days after the administration of the
booster, as compared with the nonbooster group, was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86
to 1.05; P=0.32). However, the hazard ratio for death due to Covid-19 in
participants up to 14 days after the administration of the booster, as
compared with the nonbooster group, was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.74;
P&lt;0.001). Therefore, our assumption of a 7-day lag time between the
administration of the booster and booster effectiveness was
confirmed."</span> But in contrast the reduction in mortality due to the
HVE is generally greater in the week following vaccination than in
subsequent weeks, so if the difference in COVID mortality between the
2-dose and 3-dose groups was explained by the HVE, you would expect the
difference to be even greater in the first week after vaccination than
on subsequent weeks.</p>

<p>However the explanation for why Israel and Denmark had a high number

<p>If instead of COVID cases you look at COVID deaths which is less

in the United States than in Denmark or Israel:

included data up to November 14th 2020, there were zero COVID deaths in
both the vaccine and placebo groups.
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577</a>]
But Kirsch told me he referred to the subsequent paper that was
published in September 2021 and that included data up to March 13th
2021.
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345</a>]</p>
<p>Table S4 of the newer paper shows that there was 1 COVID death in the
vaccine group and 2 deaths in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Kirsch seems to have calculated the CFR values of 1.23% and 12.50% by
taking the number of cases from the older paper where the observation
period ended in November 14th 2020. The older paper said: <span
class="quote">"There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days
after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2
and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo."</span> But
<code>1/8</code> and <code>2/162</code> match the CFR values shown in
Kirsch's table.</p>
<p>However in the newer paper where the observation period extended
about 4 months further, ther was also a much higher number of cases. The
paper said: <span class="quote">"Among 44,486 participants with or
without evidence of previous infection who could be evaluated, cases of
Covid-19 were observed in 81 vaccine recipients and in 873 placebo
recipients, corresponding to a vaccine efficacy of 91.1% (95% CI, 88.8
to 93.0)."</span></p>
<p>So this is what Kirsch's table should've looked like if he would've
taken both the deaths and cases from the same paper:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Group
</th>
<th>
Deaths
</th>
<th>
Cases
</th>
<th>
CFR

<th>
CFR low

<th>
CFR high

<td>

<td>

<td>
0.831%

</td>
<td>
81
</td>
<td>
1.234%
</td>
<td>
0.218%
</td>
<td>
6.667%
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It was also misleading that Kirsch's table didn't show the number of
deaths or cases but only the CFR ratios. At first I didn't even notice
how massive his confidence intervals were, but if his table would've
shown that there was only 1 death in the vaccine group and 2 deaths in
the placebo group, then it would've been easier to see how the
difference in the CFR ratios was not even close to significant. The
p-value of the ratios is about 0.61 so it's far from reaching a
significance level of 0.05:</p>

<p>The bottom line is when you compute all cause mortality in vaccinated

<p>Also, the 1.5 in the table above means that during peak COVID,
mortality for those born in 1950 was 1.5X higher in

<p>If it was the COVID vaccine making you 3.3X less likely to die if you

<p>The mortality differences between vaxxed and unvaxxed <strong>were
all due to selection bias </strong>because people who choose to be
vaccinated have a much lower mortality than people who can't or don't
want the vaccine, e.g., they are in hospice and going to die.</p>
<p><strong>In short, the vaccine provided no differential ACM benefit.

<p>You
<a href=https://www.nzip.cz/data/2135-covid-19-prehled-populace>download
the data</a> and grep for 1950-1954 which gives you an 80M file with
around 673K rows. Then you analyze it. Easy peasy.</p>
<p>To make it easier, you can
<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/ba4ac6038022fcc50542958dada041a07cbd1fd2/analysis/vax_24_1950.xlsx>download
the 100MB Excel file from my github</a> where I've done all the work for
you.</p>
<p>You have to first calculate the number of alive vaxxed and unvaxxed
people each day and then you can compute during the COVID and non-COVID
periods the number of person weeks at risk of dying and the number of
deaths and then normalize that for an annual rate. All the calculations
are straightforward.</p>

<p>Kirsch's low-COVID period consisted of June 14th 2021 to September
26th 2021. But especially during the earlier part of his low-COVID
period, the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality was
elevated because there were still many people who had recently gotten
the first vaccine dose so they were impacted by the temporal healthy
vaccinee effect. His high-COVID period consists of October 4th 2021 to
May 8th 2022, but in April 2022 there were no longer that many COVID
deaths.</p>
<p>When I edited Kirsch's spreadsheet so that I changed the high-COVID
period to the Delta peak on weeks 45 to 52 of 2021 and I changed the
low-COVID period to weeks 36 to 42 of 2021 which was before the Delta
wave, the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated CMR was about 4.29
during the high-COVID period but only about 2.90 during the low-COVID
period:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czechrate-4.png width=600>
</div>
<p>From my next plot you can see that during the peak of the Delta wave
in November to December 2021, unvaccinated people had over 3 times
higher ASMR than vaccinated people. But in September to October 2021
before the Delta wave, the ratio was only a bit over 2. So the increase
in ASMR during the Delta wave was clearly more pronounced in
unvaccinated people:</p>

     Unvaccinated people also include people who were vaccinated but who had no vaccination record known to Medicare. The number of unvaccinated people decreases considerably in late 2021 and early 2022, when people whose primary course doses were not known to Medicare got a booster dose that was known to Medicare.
     The Medicare dataset includes a total of 8,263,446 deaths in 2020-2022 which is about 82% of total deaths in the United States in 2020-2022 returned by CDC WONDER.
     The vast majority of people under the age of 65 are excluded from the Medicare dataset, because Medicare is generally available to only people aged 65 and above, but it is also available to younger people with certain medical conditions or disabilities.

at a higher rate than the rate they were dying before. And also, you
didn't analyze the second part of the Covid wave where you would find
the same bad news for the vaccinated. So sure you're gonna find Whatever
you're looking for if you manipulate the dates. I didn't manipulate the
dates. I simply chose the Covid period When the Covid test started going
up and then ended it when the Covid numbers went back to near zero.</p>

<p>But that's because in mid-2021 there were still many recently
vaccinated people who were impacted by the temporal HVE.</p>
<p>My ASMR for people in the Czech dataset was about 969 in May 2020. In
comparison the ASMR of vaccinated people was about 606 in May 2021 but
about 900 in May 2022, so both were lower than the 2020 baseline, but
2021 was about 37% lower than the baseline because vaccinated people
were heavily impacted by the temporal HVE in May 2021:</p>

2021  TRUE  606
2021 FALSE 2081
2022  TRUE  900
2022 FALSE 1584</pre>
<p>If you would've used the second half of 2022 as your low-COVID period
then it wouldn't have been confounded as much by the temporal HVE. My
code above shows the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR was
about 3.4 in May 2021 but only about 1.8 in May 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Added later: Kirsch has now also added other low-COVID periods and a
narrower high-COVID period to his spreadsheet. So now in the period with
the highest COVID deaths on weeks 45-52 of 2021, unvaccinated people had
about 4.3 times higher mortality than vaccinated people. And in a
low-COVID period on weeks 19-47 of 2022, unvaccinated people only had
about 2.0 times higher mortality than vaccinated people:

<p>In the English ONS data, the ratio between unvaccinated and
vaccinated mortality is elevated during the COVID wave that peaks in
August 2021 and the wave that peaks in December 2021 to January 2022.
There is a small dent in the ratio during the months in between, but
it's not too big because unvaccinated people also have fairly high COVID
mortality between the two peaks:</p>

<p>Kirsch told me that in the second plot above the ratios peaked during
different months in different age groups, which he said was a sign that
vaccines were not working. But I told him it might have been due to
random noise, and I showed him this plot which has 95% CIs for the same
ratios:</p>

<p>In February 2024 data for weekly COVID and non-COVID ASMR by
vaccination status was published by the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de
Statistiek. It included one set of data where people were counted as
vaccinated immediately after the first dose and another set where people
were only counted as vaccinated two weeks after the second dose (or 4
weeks after the first dose in the case of vaccine types like J&amp;J
that only had one dose). The data can be downloaded from the CSV files
under sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.8 here:

<p>The next plot shows that in May 2021 when vaccinated people had low
ASMR due to the temporal healthy vaccinee effect, the straggler effect
caused unvaccinated people to have a spike in ASMR even though there was
not a high number of COVID deaths. By September 2021 the temporal
healthy vaccinee effect had worn out so vaccinated people now had much
higher ASMR than in May 2021, and the ratio between unvaccinated and
vaccinated ASMR was about 2.5. But during the COVID wave in December
2021, the ratio increased to about 3.0 because unvaccinated people had
much higher COVID ASMR than vaccinated people:</p>

<a href=#Kirsch_counted_people_with_multiple_cases_multiple_times id=Kirsch_counted_people_with_multiple_cases_multiple_times>Kirsch
counted people with multiple cases multiple times</a>
</h3>
<p>There are two main Czech record-level datasets that have been
analyzed by Kirsch. The old dataset released in March 2024 contained one
row for each person. The new dataset released in November 2024 contains
one row for people with zero or one cases but multiple rows for people
with multiple cases, and it also contains information about each COVID
case, including hospitalizations and whether the case resulted in a
death. Kirsch's analysis I'm writing about here was based on the new
dataset.</p>
<p>The new dataset starts on week 10 of 2020, when the first sheet of
Kirsch's spreadsheet shows that there were 672,845 people alive at the
start of the week and 75 people who died, so there were 672,770 people
alive at the end of the week:
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/ba4ac6038022fcc50542958dada041a07cbd1fd2/analysis/vax_24_1950.xlsx>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/ba4ac6038022fcc50542958dada041a07cbd1fd2/analysis/vax_24_1950.xlsx</a>]</p>
<div>

<p>Kirsch included only people born between 1950 and 1954 in his
analysis. The new dataset has 672,876 rows where the year of birth is
between 1950 and 1954, which is 31 more than Kirsch's number of people
alive at the start of the first week. I don't know what explains the
difference. However the rows include 13,457 rows for second cases and
666 rows for third cases, so Kirsch should've subtracted them from his
number of people alive:</p>

<p>People born in 1950-1954 were 70-74 years old on December 31st 2020,
but the Czech resident population estimate for ages 70-74 on December
31st 2020 is 619,783.
[<a href=czech.html#Deaths_and_population_estimates_by_single_year_of_age_from_Eurostat>czech.html#Deaths_and_population_estimates_by_single_year_of_age_from_Eurostat</a>]
In the 2021 census on March 27th 2021, the population estimate of ages
70-74 was 618,629.
[<a href=https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&z=T&f=TABULKA&skupId=4449&katalog=33517&pvo=SLD21022-VSE&pvo=SLD21022-VSE&str=v335>https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=4449&amp;katalog=33517&amp;pvo=SLD21022-VSE&amp;pvo=SLD21022-VSE&amp;str=v335</a>]
But even <code>672876-13457-666</code> is 658,753 which is much higher
than the resident population estimates.</p>
<p>The old record-level dataset has 678,999 people with a date of birth
between 1950 and 1954, out of whom 13,419 have a date of death in 2020,
which gives a population size of 665,580 at the start of 2021:

#     total died2020
# 1: 678999    13419</pre>
<p>So I don't know why the number of people in the record-level datasets
is much higher than the resident population estimates.</p>
<p>By week 52 of 2021, Kirsch's spreadsheet has a population size of
651,074 people out of whom 81,470 are unvaccinated, so the percentage of
unvaccinated people is about 12.5%. When I excluded rows for second and
third cases, I got only 637,025 people who had not died by the end of
week 52 of 2021 out of whom only 79,116 were unvaccinated, but because
both the numerator and denominator were now smaller, the percentage of
unvaccinated people was 12.4% so it was still similar to Kirsch's
spreadsheet:</p>

#     total unaccinated
# 1: 637025       79116</pre>
<p>However the difference between the new and old record-level datasets
is bigger, because on December 30th 2021 which is the middle day of week
52 of 2021, the old record-level dataset has 649,506 people alive out of
whom 91,458 had no vaccine dose listed, so the percentage of
unvaccinated people is about 14.1%:</p>

#     total unvaccinated
# 1: 649506        91458</pre>
<p>This plot also shows that Kirsch's error makes almost no difference
in the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality rate:</p>

<p>In the plot above the maximum ratio is about 7.7, but in my earlier
plot which showed the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR in
the old record-level dataset, the maximum ratio was only about 3.7. When
I changed my earlier code to include only people between the ages of 70
and 74, the maximum ratio increased to about 5.0, so the ratio seems to
be higher in ages 70-74 than in all ages. There still remained a fairly
large difference compared to the new record-level dataset, but it might
be because the old dataset had a higher percentage of unvaccinated
people in ages 70-74.</p>

<p>Kirsch posted a spreadsheet which showed that the cumulative CFR in
the Czech Republic went up after the vaccine rollout:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czcfr-1.png width=700>
</div>
<p>But when I changed the spreadsheet to show non-cumulative CFR
instead, the CFR went down after the vaccine rollout:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czcfr-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>I think non-cumulative CFR is the proper measurement to use if you
are trying to determine whether CFR went up or down in the months after
the vaccine rollout. But maybe Kirsch plotted cumulative CFR instead
because non-cumulative CFR didn't give him the result he wanted to
see.</p>
<p>Also if Kirsch would've plotted CFR by vaccination status, he
would've seen that over the course of 2021 the CFR went down in
vaccinated people, but the CFR remained around the same level on average
in unvaccinated people:

<img src=i/czech-cfr-5.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Added later: Kirsch told me: <span class="quote">"How can the
cumulative CFR go up if the CFR is going down? That's mathematically
impossible"</span>. But I showed him the following example, where the
cumulative CFR up to week 50 is 1.0%, and there's already a large number
of cases and deaths up to week 50 so that individual weeks have little
impact on the total CFR. Then week 51 has 1.2% CFR and week 52 has 1.1%
CFR, so the actual CFR goes down between week 51 and 52, but the
cumulative CFR goes up because the CFR on week 52 is higher than the
previous cumulative total:</p>

<p>Added even later: The column for deaths in Kirsch's spreadsheet was
wrong even though the column for cases was correct. When I used the
correct data, the CFR in people born in 1950-1954 actually went up over
the first half of 2021. However there weren't yet that many people
vaccinated until May 2021, and there was a big drop in CFR that started
after the week ending May 17th:</p>

<p>This plot shows that after early 2021 vaccinated and unvaccinated
people have a similar rate of cases per capita:
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/ba4ac6038022fcc50542958dada041a07cbd1fd2/analysis/vax_24_1950.xlsx>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/ba4ac6038022fcc50542958dada041a07cbd1fd2/analysis/vax_24_1950.xlsx</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czechcases.png width=600>
</div>
<p>At first I thought the plot showed unvaccinated cases per capita
divided by vaccinated cases per capita. But actually it shows the
percentage of vaccinated people divided by the percentage of cases that
were in vaccinated people, which is kind of a weird measure. So if for
example 90% of people were vaccinated and 75% of cases were in
vaccinated people, the ratio in the plot above would be 1.8, even though
actually the number of cases per capita was 3 times higher in
unvaccinated people than vaccinated people (from
<code>(25/10)/(75/90)</code>).</p>
<p>When I changed the plot to show cases per capita in unvaccinated
people divided by cases per capita in vaccinated people, the ratio
became even higher in 2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czechcases-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Kirsch wrote <span class="quote">"Due to selection bias, the <span
class="quote">'vaccinated'</span> were about half as likely to get COVID
as the unvaxxed since healthier."</span> But I don't know if that's
true, or if HVE would account for a two-fold difference in the risk of
getting COVID. Kirsch seems to assume that vaccination has no effect on
the risk of being infected with COVID, which might cause him to
overestimate the effect of HVE on the number of cases. And he also
didn't consider that vaccinated people are probably more likely to get
tested than unvaccinated people, which might rather cause the rate of
cases per capita to be underestimated in unvaccinated people relative to
vaccinated people.</p>
<p>In this analysis Kirsch again made the error where he counted people
with multiple cases multiple times. Now it had a much bigger impact on
the results than in his other analysis for CFR, but correcting the error
made the results look more favorable to unvaccinated people because it
reduced the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated cases:</p>

<p>But anyway the plots above show that in 2021 when vaccines had the
biggest impact on COVID risk, the number of cases per capita was much
higher in unvaccinated people than vaccinated people. So if vaccines
reduce both cases and deaths, then CFR isn't necessarily a great measure
of vaccine efficacy contrary to what Kirsch has suggested.</p>
<p>Later on many unvaccinated people had acquired natural immunity, so
from the plot below you can see that by October 2022 the
age-standardized COVID hospitalization rate was only about 1.8 times
higher in unvaccinated people than vaccinated people, and by December
2023 it was only about 1.5 times higher:
[<a href=czech3.html#Age-standardized_hospitalization_rate_by_vaccination_status>czech3.html#Age-standardized_hospitalization_rate_by_vaccination_status</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-hospstandard.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Hospitalizations are probably less sensitive to healthcare-seeking
behavior than cases, so they are probably less affected by a bias where
unvaccinated people have lower healthcare-seeking behavior than
vaccinated people.</p>

<p>Earlier I used a method to estimate lives saved by vaccines in the
English ONS data and US CDC data, where for each combination of time
period and age group, I multiplied the population size of vaccinated
people with the COVID mortality rate of unvaccinated people and then I
subtracted vaccinated COVID deaths.</p>
<p>When I now tried to apply the same method to the newer Czech
record-level dataset that was published in November 2024, I got a total
of 41,114 lives saved. It's the equivalent of about 1.3 million lives in
the US population if it's simply multiplied with the ratio of US and
Czech mid-2021 resident population estimates

<p>Because each week has a different baseline in my method, my method
takes into account that unvaccinated people acquire natural immunity
over time and different variants have different lethality. But my method
doesn't take into account that unvaccinated people might be more likely
to die of COVID due to the HVE.</p>

<p>In the newer Czech record-level dataset from November 2024, the
<code>Umrti</code> column shows the week of COVID death and the
<code>DatumUmrtiLPZ</code> shows the week of death from all causes. I
don't know how COVID deaths are defined in the dataset. But the next
plot shows that COVID deaths seem to be undercounted in unvaccinated
people, because even though I excluded COVID deaths from the blue dotted
line, unvaccinated people still have a fairly big increase in ASMR
during the COVID wave in November to December 2021:</p>

<p>If 2024 which only had partial data is excluded, then the number of
COVID deaths in the new record-level dataset is identical to the number
of deaths in a file published by the Czech Ministry of Health:
[<a href=https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/api/v2/covid-19>https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/api/v2/covid-19</a>]</p>

um[year(datum)&lt;2024,.N] # 43372

nzip=fread(&quot;https://data.mzcr.cz/data/distribuce/402/Otevrena-data-NR-26-30-COVID-19-prehled-populace-2024-01.csv&quot;)

<p>So it might be that COVID deaths are undercounted in the Czech
Republic in general and not only in the new record-level dataset.</p>
<p>But anyway, in my earlier calculation where I estimated lives saved
by vaccines comparing the COVID mortality rates in vaccinated and
unvaccinated people, I might have actually underestimated the lives
saved if the number of COVID deaths in unvaccinated people was too low
in my source dataset. So next I tried estimating the lives saved based
on all-cause mortality instead, except I only looked at the period
between week 41 of 2021 and week 18 of 2022 when there was a relatively
high number of COVID deaths. My low-COVID reference periods were weeks
24 to 40 of 2021 and weeks 19 to 52 of 2022.</p>
<p>I calculated the baseline for each age group by fitting a spline
against the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated CMR during the low-COVID
periods. And then for each week in my high-COVID period, I calculated
the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated CMR and I divided it with the
spline baseline ratio, and I divided unvaccinated deaths by the
resulting ratio to get the expected deaths in unvaccinated people. And
then I subtracted the total expected deaths during the high-COVID period
from the total actual deaths to get the total extra deaths in
unvaccinated people:</p>

</div>
<p>So for example on week 48 of 2021 in ages 70-74, unvaccinated people
had about 4.214 times higher crude mortality rate than vaccinated
people. But the green spline shows that the baseline ratio on the same
week was only about 2.321, so the actual ratio was about 1.815 times
higher than the baseline. In ages 70-74 on week 48 of 2021, the ¬±1-week
moving average for deaths in unvaccinated people was about 184.333. So I
calculated the number of extra deaths in unvaccinated people as
<code>184.333-184.333/1.815</code>, which is about 83. And then I
calculated the total extra deaths by adding together the number of extra
deaths across all age groups and all weeks.</p>
<p>I got a total of 6,496 extra deaths in unvaccinated people during the
high-COVID period. But when I applied my previous method of estimating
lives saved based on COVID deaths to the same period of weeks, it gave
me a total of 29,002 lives saved which was about 4 times higher.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out why there was such a big difference
between the numbers. But then I realized it was because in the elderly
age groups with the most COVID deaths, the vaccinated population size
was bigger than the unvaccinated population size. And the bigger number
I calculated with my previous method represented the lives saved in
vaccinated people relative to a counterfactual scenario where no-one was
vaccinated, so it was a product of the vaccinated population size. But
the smaller number I calculated with my new method represented the
number of extra deaths in unvaccinated people, so it was a product of
the unvaccinated population size.</p>
<p>In the following code I modified my new method so that instead I
calculated the lives saved in vaccinated people relative to a
counterfactual scenario where vaccinated people had the same relative
increase in mortality during the high-COVID period as unvaccinated
people. So I now divided the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated
CMR with the baseline spline ratio, I multiplied the result by the
number of deaths in vaccinated people, and I subtracted the actual
deaths in vaccinated people. However I still got only 19,368 lives saved
which was about a third lower than the figure based on my earlier method
(but I don't know why because I was expecting the new figure to be
higher):</p>

<p>ASMR suffers from a bias where the total ASMR value can be inflated
if there is one age group which has nonzero deaths and small population
size. The same bias exists if you calculate age-normalized CFR by
dividing COVID ASMR by age-standardized rate of COVID cases. So in the
following plot I came up with an alternative way to calculate
age-normalized CFR instead.</p>
<p>It shows that there's a big drop in CFR during the second quarter of
2021 when people got vaccinated. But it might not necessarily be due to
vaccination, because the CFR of unvaccinated people was also lower in
the second half of 2021 than the first half of 2021:</p>

<a href=#CFR_by_variant id=CFR_by_variant>CFR by variant</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch has been saying that the vaccines are not effective because
they don't reduce CFR, because his analysis of the Czech data showed
that the cumulative CFR went up in early 2021 after the vaccine rollout.
However my previous plots showed that there were not yet many people
vaccinated until March or April of 2021, and there was actually a
considerable drop in CFR that started around April 2021 after a large
number of people had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Kirsch also has not considered that the Alpha variant in early 2021
may have had lower CFR than the Delta variant later in 2021.</p>
<p>About 9% of cases in the newer Czech record-level dataset include a
column which shows the variant associated with the case. The percentage
of cases that resulted in a death was about 5 times higher for Delta
than Alpha:</p>

<p>However in the Czech data unvaccinated people had higher CFR than
vaccinated people, and in the Alpha era there were more unvaccinated
people than in the Delta era. So in the next code I did a Poisson
regression to calculate a CFR adjusted for age and vaccination status.
Relative to a baseline of all variants, the adjusted CFR was about 1.5
times higher for Alpha but about 3.1 times higher for Delta:</p>

<p>In the code above the relative CFR was not adjusted for observation
week, even though part of the reason why the CFR got lower over time was
that more people gained natural immunity over time. After adjusting for
observation week, the relative CFR dropped to about 1.22 for Delta and
0.61 for Alpha, so there was a big drop in the CFR for both variants,
even though the ratio between Delta and Alpha still remained close to 2
like in my code above.</p>

<p>Spiro Pantazatos found a positive correlation between the percentage

in 2022 relative to 2021:

<div>

</div>
<p>In several datasets the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated
COVID mortality is greater in 2021 than 2022. So it might explain why
states with a low percentage of vaccinated people would also have
elevated mortality in 2021 relative to 2022. By 2022 many unvaccinated
people had acquired natural immunity, so relative to a baseline of
unvaccinated people, vaccines seem to have provided a greater
immunization advantage in 2021 than 2022.</p>
<p>In the English ONS dataset, unvaccinated people have about 6 to 12
times higher COVID ASMR than vaccinated people in 2021 depending on the
month. But from April 2022 onwards the ratio remains around the level of
1.7 to 2.5:

<p>In the United States working-age people also have a high percentage
of COVID deaths out of all deaths in 2021 relative to 2020 or 2022:

<p>In the following code of the same US data from NVSS, the yearly
number of COVID deaths in each age group is shown as a percentage of the
number of COVID deaths in 2020. In 2021 the percentage is about 277 in
ages 30-39 but about 69 in ages 90+, which might be because ages 90+ had
a higher percentage of vaccinated people in 2021 and they got vaccinated
earlier so they spent a greater part of the year vacccinated on average.
But by 2022 the difference between the age groups has become a lot
smaller:</p>

elderly people who had a higher percentage of vaccinated people:</p>

<p>The next plot shows that in the Dutch CBS data the ratio between
unvaccinated and vaccinated COVID ASMR is also higher in 2021 than 2022.
The ratio was fairly low in the first three months of 2021, but it might
be because vulnerable groups were vaccinated early or because many
people had been vaccinated only recenly or they had not yet gotten a
second dose. And there also were so few people vaccinated in the first
three months of 2021 that they have a relatively small contribution on
the total vaccinated ASMR in 2021:

<p>Added later: Pantazatos posted this reply to me: <span
class="quote">"If that is true, then 2021 vaccination rates should be
negatively correlated with 2021 mortality. I just checked, however, and
they are uncorrelated (all ages COVID r=-0.16, p=0.26, all ages total

was observed from 2022 to 2023, when many unvaccinated people had

But when I compared the percentage of vaccinated people at the end of

correlation coefficient of about -0.62 with a p-value of about 2e-6:</p>

<p>Here's a plot of the same data, which shows that I got a correlation
of about -0.62 in 2021 and about -0.35 in 2022, so the reason why the
ratio between 2022 and 2021 is higher in more-vaccinated states might
just be because more-vaccinated states had a lower COVID mortality rate
in 2021 than less-vaccinated states:</p>

<p>Then Pantazatos replied: <span class="quote">"You're right on the
correlation, I had a brain blip and omitted a denominator in one of the
variables. However, that negative correlation is still there in 2020,
2019 etc. and is explained by pre-existing variation in COVID
comorbidities (see my original post on Robinson's paradox) and not ratio
of unvax to vax, and the trend continues from 2022 to 2023 after most
unvaxed got immunity, and so I don't see how that can explain the
findings."</span></p>
<p>But I told him that in the plot I posted above I got a correlation of
only about -0.11 in 2020. And I showed him the following code where I
calculated a relative COVID mortality risk in this CDC dataset that
extends from October 2021 up to April 2023:
<a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/54ys-qyzm.><a
href="https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/54ys-qyzm"
class="uri">https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/54ys-qyzm</a>.</a>
For each combination of observation week and age group, I got the
expected deaths by multiplying the unvaccinated mortality rate by the
vaccinated population size, and I divided the total vaccinated deaths on
each MMWR year by the total expected deaths on the same year. The
resulting mortality risk of vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated
people was about 0.06 in 2021, 0.13 in 2022, and 0.22 in 2023:</p>
<pre>t=fread(&quot;Rates_of_COVID-19_Cases_or_Deaths_by_Age_Group_and_Updated__Bivalent__Booster_Status_20241231.csv&quot;)
d=t[outcome==&quot;death&quot;&amp;age_group!=&quot;all_ages&quot;&amp;vaccination_status==&quot;vaccinated&quot;]
o=d[,.(rr=sum(vaccinated_with_outcome)/sum(unvaccinated_with_outcome/unvaccinated_population*vaccinated_population)),.(year=mmwr_week%/%100)]
print(round(o,2),r=F)
# year   rr
# 2021 0.06
# 2022 0.13
# 2023 0.22</pre>
<p>So since my relative risk was about 1.7 times higher in 2023 than
2022, it's not surprising that by 2023 the gap in COVID mortality
between less-vaccinated and more-vaccinated states would've gotten even
smaller than in 2022. The CDC dataset I used only extended up to April
22nd 2023, but if I would've been able to include the rest of 2023 in my
calculation, then the RR in 2023 might have been even higher.</p>

<p><em>Moderna had 1.4 VAERS death reports per dose compared to Pfizer.
From the Czech data, we know that Moderna increases ACM by at least 20%

more than 14.3%. That's a train wreck.</em></p>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>It's always been next to impossible to estimate the increase in all
cause mortality (ACM) caused by Pfizer because in all the big datasets
we have Pfizer is the safest of all the vaccines. So there is no
comparator.</p>
<p>But if we use the novel method described below, we can estimate that
<strong>Pfizer raised your all-cause mortality by <em>at
least</em></strong>** 14.3% **and Moderna raised it by <em>at least</em>
20% on average for at least a year or more. Both of those are a disaster
because COVID itself (at best) increased average crude mortality rate
(CMR) by 20% per year.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>the cure was far deadlier than the
disease</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-method">The method</h3>
<p>Here's a novel method to estimate the minimum increase in ACM caused
by the Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Basically, we know from the
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/a-summary-of-why-the-czech-republic>Czech
Republic data</a> that the Moderna vaccine is at least a 20% increase
over ACM (since it is a 20% increase over Pfizer).</p></li>
<li><p>From VAERS, we find that there were 1.4X more Moderna death
reports than Pfizer on a per dose basis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If we use that as a fixed value (a 20% increase over baseline), then
we simply use the differential brand mortality reporting ratio in VAERS
for death events per dose and we can use the chart above
(<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/python/blob/876fcf660d876d801d7af9dd9dff06b9804517b7/VAERS_pfizer_ACM.py>source
code</a>) to get the number which is 14.3%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However if Moderna has 1.2 times the baseline mortality and Moderna
has 1.4 times higher mortality than Pfizer, then from
<code>1.2/1.4</code> you get that Pfizer has about 14.3% lower than
baseline mortality. So it's not 14.3% above the baseline but 14.3% below
the baseline.</p>
<p>In the <code>VAERS_ratios</code> variable in Kirsch's code which
defines the values shown on his y-axis, he calculated excess deaths for
Moderna divided by excess deaths for Pfizer:
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/python/blob/876fcf660d876d801d7af9dd9dff06b9804517b7/VAERS_pfizer_ACM.py>https://github.com/skirsch/python/blob/876fcf660d876d801d7af9dd9dff06b9804517b7/VAERS_pfizer_ACM.py</a>]</p>
<pre>B = 0.008  # Baseline ACM (0.8%)

# Define Pfizer ACM increase over baseline (%)
pfizer_acm_increase_pct = np.linspace(0.01, 0.8, 500)  # 1% to 80% increase over baseline

B = 0.008
M = 0.0096  # Fixed Moderna ACM = 20% over baseline
P_vals = B * (1 + pfizer_acm_increase_pct)
VAERS_ratios = (M - B) / (P_vals - B)</pre>
<p>But I think the <code>VAERS_ratios</code> variable should've been
just <code>M / P_vals</code> and not
<code>(M - B) / (P_vals - B)</code>, which would've given him a y-axis
value of 1.4 at an x-axis value of about -14.3%:</p>

<p>And anyway Kirsch's ratio of 1.4 times more deaths per dose at VAERS
was not even adjusted for age, but in VAERS reports for COVID vaccines
where the age field is not missing, the average age was about 5 years
higher for Moderna than Pfizer:

<p>In other subsets of VAERS data or in other pharmacovigilance
databases, Pfizer might actually get a higher rate of deaths per dose
than Moderna. For example in an old snapshot of the VAERS data from
November 2022 which still included the country identifiers of European
countries, the two European countries with the highest number of reports
were Germany and Austria, but in both of them the ratio of deaths per
reports was about twice as high for Pfizer as Moderna (even though I
didn't try calculating the ratio of deaths per doses but only deaths per
reports).

<p>Added later: Kirsch posted this reply to me at Substack:

<blockquote>
<p>no it was deliberate. The reporting ratio was 1.4 and if it's all
incremental reporting then you take the 20% / 1.4 = 14.3</p>
<p>Pfizer having &lt;baseline mortality happens only in your dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I posted this response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, now I understood your logic: If Moderna has 1.4 times higher
ratio of deaths per doses at VAERS than Pfizer, it means that Moderna
has 1.4 times higher excess deaths and not 1.4 times higher deaths from
all causes, because both Moderna and Pfizer still have the same baseline
mortality of deaths from other causes besides vaccination.</p>
<p>However a problem with your logic is that the vast majority of deaths
reported at VAERS were not actually due to vaccination, so if Moderna
has 1.4 times higher deaths per dose at VAERS than Pfizer, it reflects a
difference in all-cause mortality rather than vaccine-induced
deaths.</p>
<p>Many of the deaths at VAERS are vaccine breakthrough deaths where
someone died of COVID despite being vaccinated. And the excess deaths
since 2020 have largely been due to COVID deaths. So if the ratio of
deaths per dose at VAERS for Moderna and Pfizer reflected the ratio of
vaccine breakthrough deaths, then your method might actually work to
some extent to compare excess mortality between vaccine brands. But I
don't think that's the case, because the majority of the reports that
involve death at VAERS are not even breakthrough COVID deaths.</p>
<p>But anyway, your ratio of 1.4 times higher deaths per doses was not
even adjusted for age:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/vaers-lit-up-like-a-christmas-tree.><a
href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/vaers-lit-up-like-a-christmas-tree"
class="uri">https://kirschsubstack.com/p/vaers-lit-up-like-a-christmas-tree</a>.</a>
And in a semi-recent version of the VAERS data, the average age of
reports that didn't have an age field missing was about 49 for Pfizer
but 54 for Moderna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But anyway, Kirsch is supposed to have earlier shown that people who
got a Moderna vaccine for their first dose had about 1.3 times higher
all-cause mortality than people who got a Pfizer vaccine for their first
dose. But now he seems to be saying that Moderna has only about 5%
higher all-cause mortality than Pfizer (because 1.2 divided by 1.143 is
about 1.050).</p>

<p>Kirsch's US dataset only includes Medicare recipients in Connecticut,
but about 98% of the US population aged 65 and above is enrolled on
Medicare and ages 65 and above account for most deaths, so the
Connecticut dataset includes a total of 56,958 deaths, which is only
about 14% less deaths than in Barry Young's New Zealand dataset.</p>
<p>When I used the Connecticut Medicare data to do a Poisson regression
adjusted for 5-year age group and observation month, the relative
mortality risk against a baseline of all vaccinated people was about
1.06 for Pfizer but 0.84 for Moderna:</p>

<p>The BMJ article didn't make it clear if the 100 deaths were the first
100 deaths from all causes or only deaths that were suspected to be
related to vaccination.</p>
<p>However the Norwegian paper the BMJ article was based on said: <span
class="quote">"In the period 27 December 2020 to 15 February 2021, about
29 400 of Norway's roughly 35 000 nursing home patients were vaccinated
with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. During the same period, the Norwegian
Medicines Agency received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse
reactions to the vaccine."</span>
[<a href=https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination>https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination</a>]</p>
<p>The paper also said: <span class="quote">"The mean age of the
patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported deaths,
a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10 cases,
possible in 26 and unlikely in 59."</span></p>
<p>So in other words among approximately the first 29,400 nursing home
residents vaccinated, there were only 10 fatal adverse event reports
which were considered to be likely to have a causal link to the
vaccine.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the Norwegian paper said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spontaneous reporting system for adverse drug reactions is
primarily useful for generating hypotheses and is not particularly
suitable as a basis for assessing causality. Many of the reports did not
contain sufficient clinical information to form an impression of the
patient's clinical course and a possible causal link between vaccination
and death. Almost half of the reporting parties did not submit
additional information. In particular, there was a lack of information
about which phase of life the patients were in, and whether their health
and general condition were already rapidly or slowly deteriorating
before vaccination. All patients were in a complex clinical situation
characterised by old age, frailty and multiple chronic diseases, which
means that a variety of factors could have contributed to the deaths. It
is therefore practically impossible to determine with any certainty how
much of a role the vaccine played in the deaths.</p>
<p>The extremely high mortality rate in nursing homes means that random
factors will lead to a certain number of deaths shortly after
vaccination anyway. It cannot be ruled out that some of the deaths that
were classified as probable are in fact due to such random factors.
Nevertheless, we find it reasonable to assume that adverse effects from
the vaccine in very frail patients can trigger a cascade of new
complications which, in the worst case, end up expediting death.</p>
<p>The categories <span class="quote">'probable'</span> and <span
class="quote">'unlikely'</span> were used in cases where the expert
group considered there to be a clear likelihood one way or the other,
and the category <span class="quote">'possible'</span> was used where a
causal link between vaccination and death was just as likely as
unlikely. Many of the cases classified as <span
class="quote">'possible'</span> are therefore very uncertain, and some
of them could perhaps also have been categorised as unclassifiable. The
group considered far more cases to be either probable or unlikely than
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in its initial assessment. This
is probably due to access to more information as well as knowledge of
typical clinical courses in frail elderly people.</p>
<p>The adverse reaction reports were submitted within a period of
approximately 50 days, during which it can be assumed that 2000-2500
nursing home patients died in Norway (7). Whether 10 or 36 of these
deaths were accelerated by the vaccine, the proportion is still low. In
the same period, almost 30 000 nursing home patients were vaccinated,
which means that there will most likely have been far more than 100
deaths in nursing homes in a close temporal relationship to vaccination
in the relevant time period. Our findings cannot therefore be used to
estimate the incidence of vaccine-related deaths.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the vast majority of long-term
patients in nursing homes have a short remaining life expectancy. They
are definitely in the final stage of life. This is reflected in the
expert group's scoring of 48 out of 79 classifiable patients in CFS
category 8 or 9, which indicates an expected lifespan of less than six
months.</p>
