<p>I'll address his new arguments in the following sections.</p>

<a href=#Why_did_the_number_of_deaths_under_dose_1_not_go_down_in_Czech_data id=Why_did_the_number_of_deaths_under_dose_1_not_go_down_in_Czech_data>Why
did the number of deaths under dose 1 not go down in Czech data?</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch posted the plot below and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people getting Dose 2 are drawn from the Dose 1 recipients. If
there is a 1%/day HVE effect, we'd see it because the Dose 1 cohort
would have decreasing deaths over time to mirror the increasing deaths
in Dose 2 because HVE is a zero sum game.</p>
<p>Check it out: flat line for Dose 1 (orange curve). And since Dose 1
cohort is small, leaving those people behind would create a massive
effect, much larger than the impacts on Dose 2 because it's a transfer
of an absolute number of people because HVE is a zero sum game on
absolute counts.</p>

<p>In order to get fixed cohorts of people by dose number, Kirsch
determined the vaccination status at the end of week 24 of 2021.
Therefore he didn't have to adjust the deaths for population size since
the population sizes remained roughly constant from week 25 of 2021
onwards, apart from depletion due to deaths and change due to
migration.</p>
<p>However the period when people with only one had the lowest mortality
due to HVE was before week 25 of 2021. In Kirsch's plot the number of
deaths in people with only one dose remained around the same level
between weeks 11 and 24 of 2021. But if you look at ages 60 and above
which accounted for about 90% of total deaths in the Czech Republic in
2021, the population size of people with only one dose tripled from
about 400,000 on week 11 to about 1,200,000 on week 20, and by week 25
it had falled back down to about 400,000 after people had moved under
the second dose. By week 25 of 2021, ages 60 and above had about 4 times
as many people with two or more doses as people with only one dose:</p>

<p>The ASMR of people with 1 but not more doses was about 598 on week
18, but by week 25 it had more than doubled to about 1266, because many
of the healthy vaccinees had moved under the second dose:</p>

<p>In the next plot the ASMR of people with 1 but not more doses almost
doubled between week 18 and week 24 of 2021. The results are slightly
different from the previous code, because I used the November 2024 NZIP
data instead of the March 2024 FOI data, and I also calculated the ASMR
by year of birth and not by age:</p>

<p>This level of bias is enormous. For comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world HVE estimates in high-quality studies (e.g., flu vaccine
studies in seniors) are generally in the <strong>1.1-1.2</strong> range
(10-20%).</li>
<li>A 3.0 ratio would be <strong>unprecedented</strong> and
<strong>easily visible in every time-series ACM dataset</strong>,
including non-COVID vaccination campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="should-be-obvious-in-the-data">2. Should Be Obvious in the

<p>If this bias exists:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd expect a dramatic <strong>dip in ACM for the vaccinated
group</strong> immediately after rollout, across <em>all</em> countries,
<em>all</em> age groups, and <em>all</em> vaccines. NOTE: This dip is
sustained and <strong>would appear in calendar time</strong>, not just
in the time series.</li>
<li>It would also imply that the <strong>unvaccinated group had
catastrophic mortality</strong>, which contradicts many population-level
trends (e.g., Czech Under-80 cohort, US CDC mortality by vaccination
status in early 2021).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirsch's AI seems to have copied his mistaken understanding of what a
time series means. Kirsch says that a plot where the x-axis shows time
since vaccination and the y-axis shows deaths is a <span
class="quote">"time series"</span> plot, even though in reality a plot
where the x-axis shows calendar time is also a time series plot. In his
Substack Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"But did you know that none
of the papers in the peer reviewed scientific literature will show you a
time series plot for the COVID vaccine? I couldn't find a single
one!"</span>
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/covid-time-series-graphs-show-clearly>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/covid-time-series-graphs-show-clearly</a>]
So I guess under his definition of a time series plot, he didn't even
count survival analysis plots where the x-axis shows days since
since-vaccination and the y-axis shows probability of survival, because
during the debate he has referred to several survival analysis plots
that were published in peer-reviewed papers.</p>
<p>But anyway, the HVE does in fact appear in plots that show mortality
by calendar date. In the English ONS data, Dutch CBS data, and Japanese
FOI data released by Kenji Fujikawa, there ratio between unvaccinated
and vaccinated ASMR reaches above 4 during the vaccine rollout:
[<a href=rootclaim4.html#Comparison_to_other_datasets>rootclaim4.html#Comparison_to_other_datasets</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-cum-comparison.png width=530>
</div>
<p>There are also many studies which have shown more than a 3-fold
difference in all-cause mortality between unvaccinated and vacinated
people. In the same PDF file Kirsch wrote about a Norwegian study which
looked at all-cause mortality in people aged 70 and above during the
first three weeks after vaccination. Even though the cohorts were
matched for variables like 5-year age group and comorbidity index, the
vaccinated group had a mortality HR of only about 0.28 relative to the
unvaccinated group, with a 95% CI of about 0.24-0.31.
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9637531/>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9637531/</a>]</p>
<p>Kirsch's AI also said this about Wilf's response:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Claims short-term HVE explains the Czech divergence</strong>
<ul>
<li>His theory that HVE starts at OR = 3 and drops to OR = 1.6 is
<strong>never supported by empirical data</strong> or studies. It's pure
hand-waving.</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> As you noted, if HVE were that large and
decaying over months, it would be visible in ONS, Czech, and U.S. data.
It isn't.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>But my previous plot shows that the monthly ratio between
unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR peaks at over 5 in the ONS data, and at
over 3 in the Czech data.</p>
<p>And anyway if it's impossible for unvaccinated people to have 3 times
higher mortality than vaccinated people because of the HVE, then why did
Kirsch assume in his KCOR analysis that unvaccinated people would've
continued to have about 3.2 times higher mortality rate than vaccinated
people indefinitely? And then later when the ratio dropped to only about
2.6, why did Kirsch assume it meant that vaccines were killing 23% extra
people?</p>

<p>The paper Kirsch talked about was published in Norway's primary
peer-reviewed medical journal.
[<a href=https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination>https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination</a>]
The Wikipedia page about the journal says: <span class="quote">"The
Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Norwegian: Tidsskrift for
Den norske legeforening) is a biweekly peer-reviewed medical journal
published by the Norwegian Medical Association and established in 1881.
It includes research and review articles, news stories, and debates
about professional issues and education, as well as discussion of
medical education. The journal has been indexed by Index Medicus,
MEDLINE, and PubMed since 1965."</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Norwegian_Medical_Association>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Norwegian_Medical_Association</a>]
Perhaps Kirsch was confused by the design of the journal's website,
which looks more like an informal magazine site than a medical journal,
or he was confused by how the website publishes both formal scholarly
articles and more informal content.</p>
<p>The Norwegian paper said: <span class="quote">"In the period 27
December 2020 to 15 February 2021, about 29 400 of Norway's roughly 35
000 nursing home patients were vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine
BNT162b2. During the same period, the Norwegian Medicines Agency
received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse reactions to the
vaccine."</span> The paper also said: <span class="quote">"The mean age
of the patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported
deaths, a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10
cases, possible in 26 and unlikely in 59."</span></p>
<p>So among approximately the 29,400 first vaccinated people in nursing
homes, a causal connection between vaccination and death was considered
probable or possible in the case of 36 people, which is a rate of about
0.1% and not 36%. In the case of some reports, the vaccination may have
only been a minor contribution to the death of someone who was about to
die soon anyway. If it was possible to determine definitively how many
of the 100 people died primarily due to vaccination, it would probably
be less than 36 people, even though there might of course be additional
vaccine-induced deaths with no adverse event report filed.</p>
<p>But anyway, the results of a study are not applicable to the general
population, because the proportion of adverse event reports that involve
death out of all adverse event reports is higher in older people than
younger people. And elderly people who live in nursing homes have even
higher mortality rates than age-matched elderly people who live on their
own.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the Norwegian paper said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spontaneous reporting system for adverse drug reactions is
primarily useful for generating hypotheses and is not particularly
suitable as a basis for assessing causality. Many of the reports did not
contain sufficient clinical information to form an impression of the
patient's clinical course and a possible causal link between vaccination
and death. Almost half of the reporting parties did not submit
additional information. In particular, there was a lack of information
about which phase of life the patients were in, and whether their health
and general condition were already rapidly or slowly deteriorating
before vaccination. All patients were in a complex clinical situation
characterised by old age, frailty and multiple chronic diseases, which
means that a variety of factors could have contributed to the deaths. It
is therefore practically impossible to determine with any certainty how
much of a role the vaccine played in the deaths.</p>
<p>The extremely high mortality rate in nursing homes means that random
factors will lead to a certain number of deaths shortly after
vaccination anyway. It cannot be ruled out that some of the deaths that
were classified as probable are in fact due to such random factors.
Nevertheless, we find it reasonable to assume that adverse effects from
the vaccine in very frail patients can trigger a cascade of new
complications which, in the worst case, end up expediting death.</p>
<p>The categories <span class="quote">'probable'</span> and <span
class="quote">'unlikely'</span> were used in cases where the expert
group considered there to be a clear likelihood one way or the other,
and the category <span class="quote">'possible'</span> was used where a
causal link between vaccination and death was just as likely as
unlikely. Many of the cases classified as <span
class="quote">'possible'</span> are therefore very uncertain, and some
of them could perhaps also have been categorised as unclassifiable. The
group considered far more cases to be either probable or unlikely than
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in its initial assessment. This
is probably due to access to more information as well as knowledge of
typical clinical courses in frail elderly people.</p>
<p>The adverse reaction reports were submitted within a period of
approximately 50 days, during which it can be assumed that 2000-2500
nursing home patients died in Norway (7). Whether 10 or 36 of these
deaths were accelerated by the vaccine, the proportion is still low. In
the same period, almost 30 000 nursing home patients were vaccinated,
which means that there will most likely have been far more than 100
deaths in nursing homes in a close temporal relationship to vaccination
in the relevant time period. Our findings cannot therefore be used to
estimate the incidence of vaccine-related deaths.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the vast majority of long-term
patients in nursing homes have a short remaining life expectancy. They
are definitely in the final stage of life. This is reflected in the
expert group's scoring of 48 out of 79 classifiable patients in CFS
category 8 or 9, which indicates an expected lifespan of less than six
months.</p>

<p>By a difference of less than 1%, he probably referred to how the

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-levitables.png width=600>
</div>
<p>However the odds ratios were adjusted for a similar set of variables
that was used to do the matching. The cohorts were matched by age, sex,
race, ethnicity, vaccination site, month of second dose, and census
tract. The adjusted odds ratios were adjusted for all the same variables
except month of second dose, and the adjustment for census tract was
done in a different way, and they were additionally adjusted for
mortality at the ZIP code level.</p>
<p>So even though both methods produced an odds ratio of about 1.36, in
both cases it might be due to confounders that were not adjusted for
using either method.</p>

<p>Kirsch also wrote that there is no <span class="quote">"evidence

vaccine doses where the site type was doctor's clinic was about 21% for
Pfizer and 11% for Moderna. But the percentage for hospital ER was about
0.7% for Pfizer and 1.9% for Moderna, and <span class="quote">"other

<p>The Czech Ministry of Health has also published a CSV file which

senior homes, it was much higher for Moderna than Pfizer.

both vaccines reduce mortality more in the days after vaccination than

<p>Kirsch calculated the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated
people using the raw number of deaths, so that he treated people who
were vaccinated after the end of week 41 of 2021 as unvaccinated. In his
spreadsheet the ratio of deaths per week in the COVID period relative to
the baseline period was about 1.362 in unvaccinated people and about
1.227 in vaccinated people, so by subtracting the two numbers Kirsch got
a figure of about 0.135 for his mortality benefit in vaccinated
people.</p>
<p>In the following code I did a similar calculation using ASMR so I
didn't have to rely on Kirsch's hack of defining people vaccinated after
a given date as unvaccinated. Now the ratio of ASMR in the COVID period
divided by ASMR in the baseline period was about 1.478 in unvaccinated
people had about 1.236 in vaccinated people, so by subtracting the two
numbers I get a figure of about 0.242, which is almost twice as high as
Kirsch's figure:</p>

<p>However it would've been more appropriate to calculate the mortality
benefit as <code>1-vax/unvax</code>, and not as <code>unvax-vax</code>
like Kirsch. So if the ratio of mortality in the COVID period relative
to the baseline period would've been 5 in unvaccinated people and 3 in
vaccinated people, then vaccinated people would've had a 40% mortality
benefit, and not a 200% mortality benefit.</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote this about an analysis of Japanese FOI data published by
Kenji Fujikawa:
[<a href=https://medicalfacts.info/vdeath.rb>https://medicalfacts.info/vdeath.rb</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sent me his posts and his website where you can validate this
information. Below is the most interesting graph on his page:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hudikaha-1.png width=1084>
</div>
<p>What is undeniable is that the <strong>average mortality rate doubles
in just ONE year (from 5,000 to over 10,000)</strong> in a fixed age
group (80+) where the average mortality rate for the entire group should
be relatively constant over time (it's a zero sum game; all the cohorts
should average to the same number each period). In one year, at the
start of 2022, 90% are in Dose 2, hardly anyone is left in Dose 1, and
the rest are unvaccinated. The bars for Dose 0 and Dose 2 are the same
height (at 10,000). So the total mortality of the entire group is nearly
double what it was a year ago and it was NOT driven by the unvaccinated.
The unvaccinated mortality went DOWN and the vaccinated mortality went
up.</p>
<p><strong>This is NOT HVE</strong> because HVE effects don't modify
POPULATION means, HVE simply impacts cohorts.</p>
<p><strong>There is no other way to explain this data other than the
vaccinated (which is by far the largest group) significantly increased
their mortality.</strong></p>
<p>This is CLEARLY NOT <span class="quote">"1% HVE"</span> because HVE
never changes total mortality... it just moves deaths between cohorts.
Here you can see the <strong>total mortality of the ENTIRE COHORT
DOUBLED. That's a HUGE problem for <span class="quote">"safe and
effective."</span> There is no other way to spin it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However if you look at each semiannual group in Fujikawa's plot, the
rightmost bar for the newest vaccine dose is always lower than the
leftmost bar for unvaccinated people. Many of the doses in between have
such a small population size that they don't have much impact on total
vaccinated mortality.</p>
<p>After a large number of people has moved under the nth dose, the
mortality rate of dose n-1 shoots up because of the straggler effect.
But in the bottom panel here if you compare the gray line here against
the black line, you can see that the mortality rate of all vaccinated
people combined always remains lower than the mortality rate of
unvaccinated people:

<div>
<img src=i/statistic-yuukoku-7.png width=550>
</div>
<p>In the next plot shows the data but presented in a different way,
where I'm plotting excess deaths each month relative to the mortality
rate among all people included in the dataset the same month. The row
for dose 1+ shows that vaccinated people have negative excess mortality
each month, apart from April 2021 when only a very small number of
people had been vaccinated. As the healthy vaccinee effect wears off,
the excess mortality of vaccinated people gradually drops from about
-55% in June 2021 to about -9% in November 2021:</p>

<p>The same FOI dataset also shows that unvaccinated people have bigger
spikes in mortality during COVID waves than vaccinated people:
[<a href=statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan>statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-yuukoku-13.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the previous plot if you look at the black line which shows the
mortality rate of both vaccinated and unvaccinated people added
together, there's a large increase in the mortality rate between 2021
and 2024. It's because the age of each person was determined at the time
the data was extracted, so some of the people who were 80 years old at
the data was extracted may have been only 75 or 76 years old in early
2021.
[<a href=https://x.com/donkey1399/status/1923593814704521298>https://x.com/donkey1399/status/1923593814704521298</a>,

<p>This plot of the Japanese FOI data also shows that it takes about 120
days after vaccination for the deaths to reach a peak, which conflicts
with Kirsch's claim that the curve for HVE flattens out after 3 weeks:
[<a href=https://stop-mrna.sakura.ne.jp/db/lot_totalization.php>https://stop-mrna.sakura.ne.jp/db/lot_totalization.php</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hudikaha-2.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above the reason why the deaths start to fall after day
120 is because people start getting new booster doses so they cycle back
to day 0, and also because people who got a booster dose in 2024 start
to run out of follow-up time. If people were kept under all previous
vaccine doses after a new dose and if people wouldn't run out of
follow-up time, the deaths would continue to increase even past day
120.</p>

<p>Kirsch included only vaccine doses administered up to week 24 of
2021, so that he determined the vaccination status at the end of week
24, or equivalently at the start of week 25. The baseline period
consisted of weeks 27 to 34 of 2021. The observation period started on
week 27 of 2021 and ended on week 52 of 2022. The ratio of vaccinated to
unvaccinated deaths during the whole period relative to the baseline
period was about 1.10 for dose 1 and 1.21 for dose 2. I reproduced his
analysis exactly here, so that I even reproduced Kirsch's error of
double counting deaths in people with two COVID cases, and I didn't
exclude anomalous rows like rows where a date of vaccination was after a
date of death:</p>

<p>My plot should've been a clue to Kirsch why he got lower mortality
relative to the baseline period for dose 1 than dose 2. His baseline
period lasted from July 5th 2021 until August 29th 2021. My plot above
shows that people with 1 but not more doses had high ASMR in July and
August 2021, because by then many of the healthy vaccinees had moved
under the second dose. So during the baseline period the HVE caused dose
1 to have elevated mortality and dose 2 to have reduced mortality, but
over time after the HVE became weaker, the ratio of mortality between
dose 1 and dose 2 got lower.</p>
<p>In Kirsch's analysis the effect was not quite as dramatic as in my
plot above, because he ignored vaccine doses administered on week 25 of
2021 or later, so he classified a large part of people with two doses
under the first dose. It considerably reduced the mortality rate of
people with 1 dose, as is shown by the top panel of the next plot. But
in the bottom panel where I didn't ignore vaccine doses administered
after week 24, the mortality rate of people with only 1 dose has a large
increase after week 24:</p>

<p>In the top panel of the plot above, if you imagine dividing the line
for the first dose with the line for the second dose, the ratio between
the lines is higher in the baseline period than the average ratio later
on. So that's also why Kirsch got a higher KCOR ratio for the second
dose than the first dose.</p>

<p>So with that caveat in mind, here's what the Death by vaccination

<p>Note that <strong>if the vaccine worked, the unvaxxed/vaxxed ASMR

<p>It doesn't. <strong>It goes the other way. The ASMR for the

relatively better to be unvaccinated.</strong></p>
<p>I don't place much weight in this data. Look at how the ASMR for the
unvaccinated fluctuates in 30 days. It's not credible. So if anyone
tries to use this data, you'd have to wonder why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why he used November and December as his high-COVID period
seems to have been because the Czech Republic deaths during the Delta
wave peaked in November to December 2021. But the UK already had a lot
of Delta deaths in August, and there was a period with elevated COVID
mortality from July 2021 until January 2022.</p>
<p>But the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR dropped in
February 2022 after the COVID deaths went down. So Kirsch should've used
the period from February 2022 onwards as his low-COVID baseline period,
and not the period before November 2021 like in his analysis of the
Czech data:</p>

<p>When Kirsch said that the <span class="quote">"the ASMR for the
unvaccinated fluctuates in 30 days"</span>, I don't know if he meant the
change in ASMR during the first months of 2021 that was due to HVE, or
the change in later months that was due to variability in COVID
deaths.</p>
<p>But in case he meant the former, Kirsch should recognize by now that
the HVE explains why unvaccinated people have high mortality when the
first dose is rolled out, since he has identified a similar phenomenon
in the Czech data. He linked to a Substack post about the ONS data by
Norman Fenton and Martin Neil, who used to claim that the high mortality
in unvaccinated people in early 2021 was somehow anomalous, and it was
not explained by the HVE.</p>
<p>In 2022 Fenton and Neil also wrote a paper where they claimed that
the ONS dataset was <span class="quote">"corrupted"</span> because there
was a very low number of deaths during the first two weeks from
vaccination. But since then several other datasets have been released
which have a similarly low number of deaths in the first two weeks after
vaccination, including the Medicare and New Zealand datasets that were
released by Kirsch. Even Kirsch's own analysis of the various
record-level datasets has shown why Fenton and Neil's old preprints
about the ONS data were wrong.</p>

showed that deaths by weeks after influenza vaccination kept climbing

survival curves analysis using the Czechia data</a> confirms that the
vaccinated did uniformly worse than the unvaccinated."</span></p>
<p>The document he linked said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This analysis uses a <span class="quote">'predicted'</span> survival
using a straight line derived from the tangent to the survival curve for
each brand including the unvaccinated. The tangent is taken from early
in the survival (April 12, 2021 to May 31, 2021) trajectory to consider
evidence that late patterns of survival in each group differ from early.
It is expected that mortality benefits or harms from the covid-19
vaccinations are difficult to compare within groups due to unmeasured
confounding. This method assumes that the early survival trajectory
represents the <span class="quote">'true'</span> survival trajectory of
the group and that latter deviation from the tangent reflects the effect
of the treatment.</p>
<p>The average deviation between observed survival in the Kaplan-Meier
plot compared to the groups corresponding tangent, summarises the effect
of the treatment group (unvaccinated ["None"], <span
class="quote">"Pfizer"</span>, <span class="quote">"Moderna"</span> or
<span class="quote">"Astra-Zeneca"</span>) up until the end of 2022.
Values greater than zero indicate poorer than expected survival, whereas
negative values indicated better than expected survival. The straight
line is considered a rough approximation to expected survival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the document included plots like this for various age groups,
where the <span class="quote">"tangent"</span> looks like a linear
regression of the survival probability around days 10-60 of
follow-up:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-kaplan.png width=600>
</div>
<p>So even though unvaccinated people had a lower survival probability
than vaccinated people, the survival probability was above the tangent
for vaccinated people but below the tangent for unvaccinated people,
which Kirsch interpreted to mean that vaccinated people somehow did
worse than unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>The obvious flaw in his reasoning is that there were still many
recently vaccinated people during the period that was used to fit the
tangent, so the HVE was stronger in the period than later. But as the
HVE got weaker over time, the vaccinated mortality fell below the
tangent but the unvaccinated mortality rised above the tangent.</p>

<p>Aarstad got an r-squared value of abotu 0.57 between excess mortality
in 2022 and the percentage of vaccinated people across European
countries. But that's because he used the average number of deaths in
2016-2019 as the baseline, which exaggerated excess mortality in Western
European countries relative to Eastern European countries for two
reasons. Western European countries had a more steeply increasing slope
in yearly deaths even before COVID. And also Eastern European countries
had a higher percentage of excess deaths in 2020-2022, so the baseline
should've been lowered more in Eastern European countries to account for
the reduction in population size:

showed that was false</a>. The reason this is such an important study is
because you cannot compare vaccinated with unvaccinated death rates due
to selection bias. But in the Czech Republic, the vaccines were randomly
assigned and nobody had any clue which one was safer. So there was no
systematic or systemic bias. So how can the death rates be 30% higher in
every age group with sufficient data? <strong>The only way that can
happen is if the Moderna vaccine is more deadly.</strong> And in that
document we show 8 different data points that are consistent with
Moderna having a higher adverse event rate. We believe the higher death
rate in Moderna vs. Pfizer is primarily due to the <strong>100mcg dose
vs. 30 mcg dose.</strong> The more poison, the more death. There have
been very few brand comparison studies like this and what they do is
adjust the numbers to make the death differences go away because their
assumption going into it is that the vaccines should have equal
mortality rates so they get rid of the differences statistically. This
is raw data. You can't have a 30% higher death rate in nearly all 5 year
age groups over 50. That's statistically unlikely to happen. And even if
Pfizer was 100% safe, <strong>a 30% increase in ACM (over the first year
from the shot) is a disaster.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However now in the PDF file for his sixth round of arguments, Kirsch
wrote that he regrets not having appreciated the effect of confounders
when he compared the mortality of Moderna against Pfizer in the Czech
data:
[<a href=https://www.skirsch.com/covid/KIRSCH_COVID_shot_analysis.pdf>https://www.skirsch.com/covid/KIRSCH_COVID_shot_analysis.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In previous analyses of the Czech data, I found that the Moderna
shots were more deadly than the Pfizer shots. That calculation was using
the raw, unadjusted data.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Levi study, in the unadjusted FULL cohort, they found
the same thing (that in the raw, unadjusted full cohort, Moderna appears
to be more deadly):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-regret.png width=600>
</div>
<p>However, after <strong>basic adjustments were made to the FULL COHORT
(9M), they found that Pfizer was in fact more deadly</strong> (see the
second line of the figure above).</p>
<p>And after doing extremely tight matching, it changed the adjusted
full cohort by less than 0.5%, a tiny amount.</p>
<p>My earlier Czech analysis didn't do any of these adjustments. This is
why in observational studies they do adjustments like these because
sometimes they can flip the result.</p>
<p>The fact that the Levi study FULL cohort with basic adjustments
nearly exactly matched the nearly exactly matched MATCHED cohort
<strong>is extremely powerful</strong>.</p>
<p>The reality of course is that <strong>both vaccines were quite
deadly</strong>. If Moderna was 100% safe as we have assumed in this
analysis (since we don't know the absolute level of NCACM harm),
<strong>most all the VAERS death reports would be for only one brand of
vaccine</strong>; that just isn't the case.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of why, when looking at observational data,
basic adjustments to the raw data are necessary. I regret that I did not
fully appreciate that before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2024 Kirsch kept insisting that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were
distributed randomly and without bias in the Czech Republic, so the
difference in mortality between the vaccine brands could not have been
due to confounders, even though me and Uncle John Returns and Jeffrey
Morris kept telling him otherwise.</p>
<p>Kirsch also cherrypicked sources which showed that Moderna had higher
mortality than Pfizer, but he ignored the other sources I showed him
where Pfizer had higher mortality than Moderna.</p>
<p>I showed him that the average age of VAERS reports is much higher for
Moderna than Pfizer, but he did not account for the difference in age
distribution when he declared that Moderna was more deadly than Pfizer
based on VAERS data. In the unadjusted model of Levi et al., I believe
the main reason why Moderna had a higher mortality risk than Pfizer was
that the median age was 62 for Moderna but 54 for Pfizer, so simply
adjusting the analysis for age would've probably caused Pfizer to have a
higher mortality risk than Moderna.</p>
<p>In his initial analysis of the Czech data, Kirsch even wrote that the
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were distributed so randomly that it <span
class="quote">"created a perfect real-world randomized clinical
trial"</span>, so that he didn't have to adjust for any confounders when
he compared the mortality of the vaccine brands: <span
class="quote">"Vaccines were randomly distributed for those wishing to
get vaxxed. [...] People were not allowed to select which vaccines they
got. [...] The randomization of which vaccine someone got created a
perfect real-world randomized clinical trial where we could compute the
mortality rates for 1 year after Dose 2 for the two most popular
vaccines."</span>
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/5725ac1b64ede7124e00b72af68892f31736b349/README.md>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/5725ac1b64ede7124e00b72af68892f31736b349/README.md</a>]
After I pointed out to Kirsch that the average age at first dose was
much higher for Moderna than Pfizer, which showed that the vaccine
brands were not distributed randomly, he seems to have toned down his
initial claim about how the distribution of the vaccine brands was
perfectly randomized, but it was still the original basis of his
argument that the Czech data showed that Moderna was more deadly than
Pfizer.</p>
<p>During the first round of the Rootclaim debate, Kirsch claimed that
Moderna vaccines were more deadly than Pfizer vaccines based on his
analysis of the Czech data, but in the sixth round of the argument he
now seems to have dropped the claim, because in the Levi-Ladapo paper
Pfizer now had higher mortality than Moderna.</p>
<p>But in the same way that in 2024 Kirsch was confident that the
distribution of vaccines in the Czech Republic was so random that
confounders couldn't have explained why Moderna had higher mortality
than Pfizer, he is now confident that Levi's matching procedure was so
perfect that confounders cannot explain why Pfizer has higher mortality
than Moderna.</p>

series plots for deaths by time since vaccination</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch referred to this Substack post, which includes various plots
for deaths as a function of time since vaccination:
<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/covid-time-series-graphs-show-clearly.><a

Most of them were based on Medicare data that Kirsch received from a
source at the HHS in 2023.</p>
<p>Kirsch claims that the HVE only lasts for 3 weeks, because in this
plot of deaths by weeks since the first dose in the Czech data, there is
a sharp turning point in mortality around day 21:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-6.png width=550>
</div>
<p>But he pointed out that a similar turning point is more difficult to
see for second and third doses:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-7.png width=550>
</div>
<p>However the sharp turning point around day day 21 for first doses is
because many people got the first dose at the tail end of the period
with high COVID deaths in early 2021, so there was a sharply decreasing
trend in background mortality rate:
[<a href=czech4.html#Plot_for_raw_deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination>czech4.html#Plot_for_raw_deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-rawweek.png width=660>
</div>
<p>Kirsch also posted these plots of Medicare data, where people who got
the first COVID vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 have a turning
point in deaths around the third week after vaccination, but the curve
in deaths is more smooth in people who got the first dose in the second
quarter of 2021, but it's because people vaccinated in the first quarter
had a more sharply decreasing trend in the background mortality rate
than people vaccinated in the second quarter:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-5.png width=600>
</div>
<p>Kirsch also published a spreadsheet that shows the number of deaths
grouped by month of the first COVID vaccine dose. It only includes data
for the first three months of 2021, but it still clearly shows how the
effect of the COVID deaths during the first 100 days from vaccination
was higher for people vaccinated in January than for people vaccinated
in February or March. Even among people vaccinated in March, the
increase in deaths between days 50 and 100 is more steep than in people
vaccinated in February:

<p>Kirsch recognized the problem himself in the sheet <span
class="quote">"vaxxed in jan 2021"</span> of his spreadsheet, where he
included these comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what's happening is deaths are falling from COVID at the same time
the deaths are rising from the vaccine so you never get a <span
class="quote">"low"</span> baseline.... The two effects are keeping the
baseline deaths elevated</p>
<p>So you can never <span class="quote">"see"</span> a true <span
class="quote">"baseline"</span> because it is masked by the COVID
deaths.</p>
<p>The COVID deaths are coming down at the same time the vaccine deaths
rate from the vax is ramping up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirsch also showed these plots of flu and pneumonia vaccines
administered in the first quarter of 2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>However his plots have the same problem as the plot for COVID
vaccines administered in the first quarter of 2021. The United States
had very high excess deaths in January 2021 due to COVID, but by March
2021 the excess deaths had returned close to zero. So in Kirsch's plots
the background mortality rate is high at the start of the x-axis but
afterwards it gradually drops as the proportion of observation time from
January and February drops. So the increasing trend in mortality due to
the HVE is counteracted by the decreasing trend in the background
mortality rate, so it's difficult to evaluate from his plots how long
the HVE lasts.</p>
<p>However if you don't cherrypick vaccine doses administered in the
first quarter of 2021, then the period after vaccination when there is
reduced mortality lasts much longer than 3 weeks. The next screenshot
shows one of the spreadsheets that Kirsch published on his S3 server in
December 2023.
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new</a>,
<a href=f/Medicare-flu-pneu-covid_given_21_or_22.xlsx>f/Medicare-flu-pneu-covid_given_21_or_22.xlsx</a>]
It shows that for flu vaccines administered at any time in 2021 or 2022,
the deaths take about 100 days to reach the peak. The peak is probably
due to elevated mortality in the winter combined with the effect of
COVID waves, because flu vaccines are often administered before the flu
season. But anyway, now the increase in deaths over the first 100 days
is more smooth than in the plot for vaccine doses administered in the
first quarter of 2021, because the vaccine doses are distributed more
evenly across time so there is not a sharp decrease in the background
mortality rate at the start of the x-axis:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>The plot above actually looks like what would expect from an unsafe
vaccine, because there is a high number of deaths on day 0 which refers
to the day of vaccination. Deaths caused by vaccines are likely to be
heavily concentrated on the day of vaccination and the next few days. So
if deaths as a function of time since vaccination go down during the
first few days from vaccination, it's a sign that there might be some
deaths caused by the vaccination. But Kirsch has developed a
counterintuitive line of reasoning, where he claims that if deaths as a
function of time since vaccination go up over time, it means that
vaccines are killing more people over time.</p>
<p>This plot for shingles vaccines also shows that it takes much longer
than 21 days for the HVE to wear off so that deaths reach a stable
level:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-timeseries-3.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the next plot I combined data for deaths by days since vaccination
from various spreadsheets on Kirsch's S3 server. I excluded the day of
vaccination because it stretched the y-axis too much for pneumonia
vaccines. You can see that COVID vaccine administered in 2021 look
atypical because they have the notch around day 20-30. But across all
vaccine types and all years of vaccination, a more typical curve looks
more smooth so that it takes about 100 days to reach a somewhat stable
level:</p>

<p>In the next plot I calculated excess mortality in the Czech dataset
that was adjusted for age and the background mortality rate. For each
combination of age group and observation month, I used the mortality
rate of all people included in the dataset as the baseline. Then for
each dose number and week after vaccination, I multiplied the
person-days for each combination of age group and observation month with
the baseline mortality rate to get the expected number of deaths, and I
calculated the percentage of excess deaths by dividing the actual deaths
by expected deaths and subtracting 1. It takes about 20 weeks for the
excess mortality to stabilize around the level of -25% to -15%, even
though it later keeps climbing even closer to 0%

had dropped to about 2.8 for the first dose, 2.5 for the second dose,
3.3 for the third dose, and 2.0 for the fourth dose:</p>

<p>In the next plot I split people into three groups depending on the
month when they got the first vaccine dose. Week 0 consists of the day
of vaccination and the next 6 days. People vaccinated in January or
February have a peak in deaths on week 2, and people vaccinated in March
or April have a peak in deaths on week 3, but the early peak is missing
in people vaccinated in May or June. However the baseline also has a
much bigger drop during the first 10 weeks for the first two groups and
a smaller drop for the third group. However once you plot the deaths as
a proportion of the baseline, in all three groups the proportion reaches
a plateau around week 20:</p>

of mortality rates by age group in Czech data</a>
</h3>
<p>When Kirsch first published his KCOR analysis of the Czech data, I
told him he should've done the analysis based on mortality rates instead
of the raw number of deaths, and he shouldn't have shown simply the
ratio between the adjusted unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality, but he
should've made a series of plots that first showed what the unvaccinated
and vaccinated mortality rates were each week, then what their ratio
was, and then what their ratio relative to the baseline period was.</p>
<p>For example among people born in 1950-1954 which Kirsch selected for
his initial KCOR analysis, the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated
mortality rate was about 3.2 in the baseline period but about 2.6 times
higher during the whole observation period, so Kirsch said it meant that
vaccines had killed about 23% extra people, because he assumed that the
ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality should've remained
at a level of about 3.2 indefinitely, but if the ratio later fell lower,
it meant that vaccines were killing people. But his analysis was not
very transparent because he didn't show the mortality rates anywhere but
only the raw number of deaths, so most of his followers probably didn't
realize what his claim that vaccines were killing people was based
on.</p>
<p>Now he actually fulfilled my request and he did a similar analysis
using crude mortality rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a traditional mortality analysis, we simply look how many man
weeks people spend in the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated bucket and tally
how many people die.</p>
<p>We do this over the non-COVID baseline period to establish relative
mortality rates of the two cohorts.</p>
<p>Then we measure the deaths and man-weeks as the cohorts dynamically
change (unvaccinated get vaccinated). Then we compare the ratios at the
end of 2022.</p>
<p>The calculations summarized below are detailed in this
<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/acc1a4dfa8fe74f465e199e7c7e4747ac165ac14/analysis/cz_death_rates_ages_moe_jc.xlsx>spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-moe.png width=650>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the row for people born in 1950-1954 in the table
above, you can see that the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated
mortality was about 3.30 in the baseline period but about 2.66 during
the whole observation period. So by dividing 3.30 with 2.66, Kirsch go a
ratio of 1.24, which he interpreted to mean that vaccines were killing
24% extra people.</p>
<p>His logic is similar to his earlier KCOR analysis, but this time the
steps he took to calculate his supposed vaccine harm are more
transparent, so it's easier to see how shaky the foundation of his
reasoning is.</p>
<p>In the PDF file Kirsch also wrote that the so-called traditional
method of using mortality rates is <span class="quote">"much less
accurate"</span> than KCOR <span class="quote">"because the cohorts
change in composition over time"</span>. But the vaccinated and
unvaccinated cohorts do change in reality as well as more people get
vaccinated over time. So is it not inaccurate how with the KCOR method
he has to misclassify a part of vaccinated people as unvaccinated? It
actually results in a fairly large reduction in unvaccinated mortality
during the Delta wave, since the vaccinated people who are misclassified
as unvaccinated have lower mortality than real unvaccinated people. And
another way in which his KCOR method is less accurate than using
mortality rates is that KCOR is not adjusted for a higher rate of
depletion in the unvaccinated cohort over time due to a higher mortality
rate in unvaccinated people.</p>

all-cause mortality (ACM), this implies that - even under perfect
conditions - the vaccine could only have reduced the absolute ACM of
those who got vaccinated by about 1.2%/yr. That is a negligible
benefit."</span></p>
<p>The paper by Arbel et al. didn't compare vaccinated people against
unvaccinated people, but people with 3 doses against people with 2
doses.</p>
<p>Relative to a baseline of people with 2 doses, the people with 3
doses got an odds ratio of about 0.10 for COVID mortality and 0.23 for
non-COVID mortality.
[<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624>https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2115624</a>,

<p>Arbel's odds ratio was adjusted for medical comorbidities, but still
Arbel got odds ratio of about 0.23 for non-COVID mortality, which
suggests that the adjustment for medical comorbidities was not
sufficient to eliminate confounding by HVE.</p>
<p>But did the HVE disproportionately affect risk of COVID deaths so
that the odds ratio of 0.10 could be entirely attributed to the HVE? I
don't think that's the case, but there is in fact a mechanism of how HVE
could disproportionately affect the risk of death from COVID.</p>
<p>People who had a currently documented case of COVID or who were
hospitalized with COVID usually did not get an additional vaccine dose
until they had recovered. So a common reason why the subjects in Arbel's
study remained under the second dose may have been that they were
currently infected with COVID, which might partially explain why people
with 2 doses had higher COVID mortality than people with 3 doses.</p>
<p>The study included only people aged 60 and above, and it lasted from
August 6th 2021 until September 29th 2021, which was the period when the
majority of people aged 60 and above got the first booster dose in
Israel, but the period of the study also coincided with the weeks when
Israel had the highest number of COVID deaths during the Delta wave:</p>

<p>If a similar study would've been done in another country where the
booster dose was rolled out in August to September and there was a COVID
wave in October to November, and the study lasted from August to
November so that most COVID deaths would've occurred after people
already had the opportunity to choose whether they got a booster dose or
not, it might have reduced a bias where the COVID mortality of people
with 2 doses was elevated because people who were currently infected
with COVID decided to not get a booster dose.</p>
<p>But anyway, another possible problem with Arbel's study was that the
odds ratio was not adjusted for the proportion of observation time at
different parts of the observation period. The number of COVID deaths
peaked around the middle of the study, and it was higher at the end of
the study than the beginning of the study. All subjects in the study
started in the group with 2 dose, and people were only added to the
3-dose group after 7 days from the third dose. So people with 2 doses
had more observation time in the first half of the study than the second
half, and people with 3 doses had more observation time in the second
half than the first half.</p>
<p>In the following code I used the English ONS data to calculate an
odds ratio for COVID deaths, where I adjusted the ratio for age by
including the age group as a categorical variable, and I adjusted the
odds ratio for the amount of observation time from different months by
including the age as a categorical variable. I included only people aged
50 and above to be consistent with Arbel's study, but I looked at the
last 4 months of 2021 instead of only August and September of 2021,
because England took longer than Israel to reach a high booster
coverage. Now the odds ratio of people with 3 doses relative to people
with 2 doses was about 0.08, which was even lower than the ratio of 0.10
in Arbel's study:</p>

<p>When I looked at the odds ratios for each month individually, I
noticed that the odds ratio for COVID mortality was very low during the
booster rollout in October 2021 to December 2022, but it increased
dramatically after January 2022. But I don't know if it's because the

<p>I'll repeat what Kirsch wrote so I can address the error in his
arithmetic: <span class="quote">"What's even worse is that the Arbel
study showed the unvaccinated were 10 times more likely to die from
COVID, but this was likely due to selection bias - not vaccine
protection. In other words, the people who got vaccinated were already
much healthier and less likely to die from COVID. So even if the vaccine

deaths by just 10%. Since COVID deaths accounted for only about 12% of
all-cause mortality (ACM), this implies that - even under perfect
conditions - the vaccine could only have reduced the absolute ACM of
those who got vaccinated by about 1.2%/yr. That is a negligible
benefit."</span></p>
<p>Let's suppose there is a country that consists of 9 million healthy
people and 1 million unhealthy people. Relative to the healthy people,
the unhealthy people have 10 times higher COVID mortality rate and 4
times higher mortality rate from other causes. COVID deaths account for
12% of all deaths in the country, and the country has 100,000 total
deaths in a year, so there are 12,000 COVID deaths and 88,000 non-COVID
deaths in a year.</p>
<p>By solving the equation <code>x*9e6+10x*1e6=12000</code> where
<code>x</code> is the yearly COVID mortality rate in healthy people,
<code>x</code> is <code>12000/19e6</code>, which is about 0.063%.
Similarly the non-COVID mortality rate in healthy people is
<code>88000/13e6</code>, which is about 0.677%.</p>
<p>So therefore if vaccination was 100% effective in eliminating all
COVID deaths, it would reduce all-cause mortality in healthy people by
about 9%:</p>
<pre>healthycovid=12000/19e6
healthynoncovid=88000/13e6

healthycovid/(healthycovid+healthynoncovid)
# 0.08533917</pre>
<p>And vaccination would reduce all-cause mortality in the whole
population by about 6%:</p>
<pre>(healthycovid+healthynoncovid)*9e6+(unhealthycovid+unhealthynoncovid)*1e6
# 100000

(healthynoncovid)*9e6+(unhealthycovid+unhealthynoncovid)*1e6
# 94315.79</pre>
<p>The flaw in Kirsch's reasoning was that if healthy people have 10%
the COVID mortality risk of unhealthy people, then healthy people would
account for 10% of all COVID deaths. But actually the proportion of
COVID deaths in healthy people depends on what fraction of the
population is healthy.</p>

lucky and the deaths/wk rates of the vaxxed and unvaxxed cohorts
selected at the normal Jun 2021 enrollment date happened to match up
nearly exactly. No baselines needed. This happens because the vaxxed are
older and die more, the unvaxxed are younger and die less, but there are
more of them and so the counts equalize.</p>
<p>So these are <strong>naturally balanced cohorts</strong>. No

<p><strong>It shows two effects:</strong> 1) the unvaxxed died less

(1 or more doses) or unvaxxed. It's as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>Here are the important things to note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The curves start off with the unvaxxed dying at a slightly higher
rate than the vaxxed.</li>
<li>When COVID starts, the unvaxxed die at a LOWER rate than the vaxxed.
Let that sink in. This is the most important part of the whole debate.
The unvaxxed did better during COVID than the vaxxed. No camera tricks.
No cherry picking. No data errors. <strong>The unvaxxed cohort did
better than the vaxxed during COVID.</strong></li>
<li>When the boosters are done rolling out, <strong>we observed the
mortality of the vaxxed take off like a jet plane off a runway</strong>.
Boom. That's not selection bias as Saar claims. That is legitimate
vaccine harm.</li>
</ol>
<p>So this is <strong>the only plot I really need to win the
bet</strong>. This single chart alone falsifies the claim that the
vaccines were uniformly beneficial. It shows that <strong>once baseline
differences are neutralized, the unvaccinated fared better during
COVID</strong>, and boosters triggered a clear mortality increase.</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"When COVID starts, the unvaxxed
die at a LOWER rate than the vaxxed."</span> But his plot showed raw
deaths and not mortality rates, so it's confusing how he spoke of rates,
unless he meant the rate of deaths per week.</p>
<p>Vaccinated people also happened to have a higher crude mortality rate
than unvaccinated people, because the unvaccinated cohort was bigger
than the vaccinated cohort, because Kirsch treated people who were
vaccinated on week 25 or later as unvaccinated. But neither raw
mortality rates or crude mortality rates are too meaningful if you're
looking at cohorts with a vastly different age distribution.</p>
<p>The next plot shows that from the start of the observation period on
week 24 of 2021 until the end of available data, the ratio of
unvaccinated to vaccinated ASMR remains above 1 each week. The ratio is
elevated in summer and fall of 2021 because the HVE is still strong
because there are many recently vaccinated people, and the ratio is
elevated in the winter of 2021-2022 because unvaccinated people have
high COVID mortality. But once the COVID deaths go down and the HVE has
become weaker, the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR also
starts to fall:</p>

<p>Kirsch says that if the ratio between vaccinated and unvaccinated
mortality is higher in 2022 than 2021, it means that unvaccinated people
did worse than vaccinated people in 2022. But in reality it could also
be that unvaccinated people did worse in both 2022 and 2021, but they
did even more worse in 2021.</p>

His sheet has a total of 154,543 deaths in vaccinated people. I was able
to reproduce the figure when I didn't exclude rows for duplicate cases,
I didn't exclude people with a year of birth missing, and I counted
vaccine doses administered up to week 24 of 2021 inclusive of week
24:</p>

<p>In the following code I reproduced Kirsch's analysis exactly so that
I also reproduced his errors. I calculated the ASMR by the 5-year groups
for year of birth so that I used the people included in the dataset on
week 1 of 2022 as the standard population (or strictly speaking I
counted people with two cases twice in the standard population, but it
doesn't make much difference here). But anyway, on week 24 of 2021,
unvaccinated people had about 3.8 times higher ASMR than vaccinated
people:</p>

<p>If the ratio is lower in 2022 than 2021, Kirsch interprets it to mean
that vaccinated people are doing worse than unvaccinated people in 2022.
But he could just as well use the ratio in 2023 as the baseline, and
then because the ratio is higher in 2022 than 2023, he could say that
unvaccinated people are doing worse than vaccinated people in 2022.</p>

rate by weeks after third dose in New Zealand</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch posted this plot that shows deaths per 100,000 person-years by
weeks since third dose in Barry Young's New Zealand dataset, and he
claimed it showed that vaccines were killing people because the
mortality rate was not flat over time:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-nzdose3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>His plot only included ages 60 and above. The reason why the
mortality rate increased between week 0 and 30 was because the healthy
vaccinee effect got weaker over time, and also because the rollout of
the first booster to ages 60 and above peaked in January to February
2022, but New Zealand had the first big wave of COVID deaths in March
2022.</p>
<p>The reason why the mortality rate started going down after week 27
was because people were removed from the population size after they got
a fourth dose, people at the lower end of ages 60 and above were less
likely to get a second booster than older people, so the average age of
people with only three doses went down after the second booster was
rolled out.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of people with 3 doses remains above the baseline
mortality rate from week 24 onwards, but it's because the healthy
vaccinees moved under the 4th dose, so the people who remained under the
4th dose had elevated mortality because of the straggler effect:</p>

<p><strong>ChatGPT said</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're absolutely right - <strong>COVID was not a proportional hazard
across</strong> age groups, and your reasoning is solid.</p>
<h3 id="heres-why">Here's why:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Proportional hazards assumption:</strong></p>
<p>In survival analysis, the <strong>proportional hazards
assumption</strong> means that the <strong>hazard ratio between two
groups stays constant over time and across covariates</strong> (like
age). If a disease is a proportional hazard, the relative risk (e.g.,
hazard ratio) would be stable across groups - say, if everyone had a 3x
higher risk due to some factor, regardless of baseline risk.</p>
<p><strong>2. COVID clearly violated this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 <strong>disproportionately impacted older
individuals</strong>.</li>
<li>Studies showed the <strong>infection fatality rate (IFR)</strong>
was:
<ul>
<li><strong>~0.001%</strong> for children</li>
<li><strong>~0.01%</strong> for 20-year-olds</li>
<li><strong>~1%</strong> for 60-year-olds</li>
<li><strong>~10-20%</strong> for 85+ in some nursing home settings</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>60-year-old has ~100x higher COVID death risk</strong>
than a 20-year-old.</li>
<li>Yet, for <strong>all-cause mortality</strong>, a 60-year-old only
has about a <strong>10x higher baseline risk</strong> than a
20-year-old.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Implication: COVID was more than proportional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>COVID <strong>amplified risk nonlinearly</strong> with age, far
beyond what you'd expect if it were a proportional hazard based on
background mortality.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However instead of relying on estimates of IFR, he could've looked up
how COVID mortality by age group compares to all-cause mortality. In the
United States in 2020-2023, the COVID mortality rate as a percentage of
all-cause mortality rate was about 8-9% in all 10-year age groups
between 40-49 and 80-89. In ages 30-39 it was only about 5%, and in ages
20-29 it was only about 2%. However younger age groups have a low
percentage of deaths from natural causes in general and not only a low
percentage of COVID deaths, so the percentage of deaths from natural
causes was about 96% in ages 80-89 but only about 24% in ages 20-29:</p>

<p>(In the code above I defined deaths from natural causes as deaths
with the underlying cause A-Q or COVID, even though there's also some
deaths from natural causes that have an R or U code listed as the
underlying cause.)</p>
<p>In the United States in 2020-2023, people aged 60 had only about 11
times higher mortality rate than people aged 20, which is close to
Kirsch's estimate of a 10-fold difference, but it's because young people
in the United States have a lot of deaths from drug overdoses and other
external causes. But for example in the Czech Republic in 2020-2023,
people aged 60 had about 21 times higher mortality rate than people aged
20:</p>

<p>But again, it's expected for younger age groups to have a low
mortality rate for deaths from natural causes relative to the overall
mortality rate of the age group. That doesn't mean that within an age
group the most frail people would have a disproportionately high risk of
dying from COVID relative to dying from other causes. And it doesn't
mean that the HVE would explain why unvaccinated people would have a 10
times higher COVID ASMR than vaccinated people but only 3 times higher
all-cause ASMR.</p>
<hr />
<p>In many datasets there isn't even too much difference between age
groups in the COVID mortality rate relative to the all-cause mortality
rate. For example in the latest version of the English ONS data, the
percentage of COVID deaths out of all deaths ranges from about 4.1% in
ages 18-39 to about 5.6% in ages 80-89:</p>

<p><strong>Pfizer MUST increase the absolute NCACM of the recipient by

<p>Since Pfizer was only 60% of the shots in the US, this means that the
mRNA shot <strong>increased absolute NCACM by at least 22%</strong>
(which is .6*.36). That increase lasted at least one year, but

<p>He linked to a spreadsheet where he digitized a plot from Figure 2 of
the Levi-Ladapo paper, so he could calculate the ratio between the
cumulative Pfizer risk and Moderna risk. The ratio during the early days
doesn't seem reliable because of error introduced by the digitization,
because Moderna had negative deaths on days 0 to 7, and the ratio was
about -12 on day 7 but about 26 on day 8, so Kirsch omitted the first 15
days from his plot. However later on you can see that the ratio remains
at a stable level of about 1.4 (even though the ratio of non-cumulative
mortality would of course be less stable):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-leviratio.png width=700>

<p>From the original plot it's not clear if the non-COVID mortality
ratio between Pfizer and Moderna is elevated during the early weeks or
not:

<p>Levi et al. should've extended their analysis further than 1 year. If
the ratio between Pfizer and Moderna mortality risk would've continued
to be elevated even in 2023 or 2024, it is not compatible with Kirsch's
calculation that Pfizer vaccines increased mortality among the entire US
population by 22%, because the United States had close to 0% excess
mortality in 2023 and 2024:</p>

<p>Also in my plot above there was a total of only about 17% excess
deaths in 2021 and 9% in 2022, and most of it was accounted by deaths
with the underlying cause COVID, so there doesn't seem to be room for
22% excess deaths caused by Pfizer vaccines.</p>
<p>Kirsch even calculated the percentage of 22% wrong, because he
multiplied 36% with the percentage of vaccinated people who got a Pfizer
vaccine, even though he should've multiplied 36% with the percentage of
total US population that got a Pfizer vaccine (or a percentage by age
group weighted by deaths within each age group).</p>

<p>And I asked him that if the short-term HVE lasts for only 3 weeks
like he claims, then why do unvaccinated people in the Koganei data have
higher mortality in the last 3 months of 2021 than in 2022-2024? If you
look at only ages 60+ which account for about 95% of all deaths in the
dataset, then in the last 3 months of 2021 there are no longer many
people who had received the first dose less than 21 days ago, so if the
short-term HVE only lasts for 3 weeks, it should no longer have elevated
the mortality of unvaccinated people by too much:</p>
<pre>t[age&gt;=60&amp;week&lt;=2&amp;dose==1&amp;month%like%2021][,.(pdays=sum(pop)),month]
#   month  pdays # person-days of people aged 60+ who received
# 2021-03    627 # the first dose less than 21 days ago
# 2021-04   7434
# 2021-05 157371
# 2021-06 270027
# 2021-07 159067
# 2021-08  35337

# 2021-10   5796
# 2021-11   1152
# 2021-12    391</pre>
<p>But in the last 3 months of 2021, unvaccinated people have about 3.4
times higher ASMR than vaccinated people:</p>
<pre>s=t[dose&lt;=1&amp;month%like%&quot;2021-1[012]&quot;]
a=s[,.(dead=sum(dead),pop=sum(pop)),.(dose,age=pmin(age,95)%/%5*5)]
a[,std:=a[,sum(pop),age][,V1/sum(V1)][factor(age)]]
a[,sum(dead/pop*std),dose][,V1[1]/V1[2]] # 3.41715</pre>
<p>In the next plot I calculated the baseline by multiplying the number
of person-days for each combination of age group and observation month
with the mortality rate among all people included in the dataset for the
same combination of age group and observation month. You can see that it
takes much longer than 3 weeks after vaccination for the deaths to reach
close to the baseline:</p>

<a href=#HVE_test_for_KCOR id=HVE_test_for_KCOR>HVE test for KCOR</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch updated his Substack post about KCOR to add the following
section:
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/czech-data-clearly-shows-covid-vaccines>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/czech-data-clearly-shows-covid-vaccines</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="hve-tests">HVE tests</h3>
<p>If there is HVE, deaths shift from the vaccinated group to the
unvaccinated group and the # of deaths shifted exponentially decays with
a 4 day half life.</p>
<p>So in 3 weeks it is mostly gone.</p>
<p>But that is if you were vaccinated right before the enrollment date.
In the Czech Republic, we chose an enrollment date of 6/14/21 well after
most of the people who die were vaccinated. So there is no reason for a
3 week delay.</p>
<p>And we can prove that by doing an objective HVE test.</p>
<p>Here are the HVE tests to see if there is HVE over a period of time,
e.g., 4 weeks.</p>
<p>See the HVE tests tabl of the KCORv2 spreadsheet for details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plot the average(u,v)/average(u,v final) raw death counts over
time. If it's HVE, the average should be 1 over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src=i/rootclaim-hvetest-1.jpg width=240></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>If there is HVE, this should be =1 for all values of t.</p></li>
<li><p>Test for exponential decay:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src=i/rootclaim-hvetest-2.jpg width=500></p>
<p>On ideal simulated data, we get exactly as expected:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hvetest-3.png width=700>

<p>On the Czech data right after the enrollment date it's doesn't look
like HVE at all.</p>

<p>The screenshots were from the <span class="quote">"HVE tests"</span>
sheet in the <code>KCORv2.xlsx</code> file:

<p>In the spreadsheet Kirsch considered that if unvaccinated deaths
follow an exponential decay plus a constant factor, then the
unvaccinated deaths subtracted from the constant factor will be linear
on a log scale. And similarly if vaccinated deaths follow a constant
factor minus exponential decay, then the vaccinated deaths subtracted
from the constant factor will be linear on a log scale. That happens to
be true in his simulated data at the top, where the HVE deaths decay
exponentially, unvaccinated deaths are 100 plus HVE deaths, and
vaccinated deaths are 300 minus HVE deaths.</p>
<p>However the Czech plot at the bottom only includes 4 weeks, which are
weeks 24 to 27 of 2021. Kirsch should've included a much longer period
in his plot, because different people were vaccinated at different
times, and many people were vaccinated long before his observation
period started, so there was not a very sharp increase in vaccinated
mortality at the start of his observation period. And there's so much
week-to-week variation in the deaths that 4 weeks is not long enough to
evaluate if the deaths follow an expontential function or not.</p>
<p>And anyway the unvaccinated deaths had not yet reached a plateau on
week 27 of 2021, so even if the unvaccinated deaths followed an
exponential decay, the deaths on a given week minus deaths on week 27
would not be linear on a log scale. Kirsch should've rather tried to fit
a curve of the form <code>a*exp(b*week)+c</code> to the data, like in my
next plot.</p>
<p>In the next plot I adjusted deaths for seasonality by dividing deaths
by deaths the same week in both unvaccinated and vaccinated people. I
also excluded weeks with high COVID deaths in October 2021 to April
2022. After that both vaccinated and unvaccinated deaths roughly
followed an exponential function:</p>

<p>The next plot shows excess deaths by weeks after the first dose in
the Czech FOI data. The exponential, logistic, and Gompertz functions
all produce a fairly good fit to the data, even though they are all too
low on week 0. However the logarithmic function produces a much worse
fit:</p>

<p>A few days after Steve Kirsch published a spreadsheet of the

<p>I used the CSV file to do a Poisson regression for mortality by
vaccine brand, which I adjusted for age group, sex, observation month,
and vaccination month. The mortality rate ratio of Pfizer relative to
Moderna was about 2.0 for first doses, 2.2 for second doses, 0.8 for
third doses, 0.7 for 4th doses, and 0.4 for 5th doses, and 0.5 for 6th
doses. So Pfizer had higher mortality for primary course doses but
Moderna had higher mortality for booster doses:</p>

<p>The third and fourth doses had the most deaths for Moderna so they
had the narrowest confidence intervals. I kept people included under
earlier doses after a new dose, so if someone died after getting a
Moderna vaccine for the third dose and a Pfizer vaccine for the fourth
dose, I counted their both death under Moderna for the third dose and
under Pfizer for the fourth dose.</p>
<p>Here's a plot of the same data, where you can see how dose 3 has a
much narrower CI than dose 4 on a log scale, even though the CIs have
similar width without log transformation:</p>

<p>The Levi-Ladapo study included only primary course doses, but it
would be interesting to see if their results would change if they looked
at third or fourth doses instead.</p>
<p>The next plot shows a monthly excess percentage of deaths that was
only adjusted for age but not other variables. Moderna doesn't have a
big enough sample size to calculate monthly mortality rates reliably.
But you can still roughly see how Pfizer has higher mortality for doses
1 and 2, Moderna for doses 4-6, and doses 3 and 7 are closest to a
draw:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just realized that the US study comparing Pfizer to Moderna
mortality gives all cause and covid deaths of vaxed people during the
study (12mths after vax)</p>
<p>The resulting ratios are much lower than those of the 12mths moving
forward of the general pop which hints at vax efficacy</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fisch-1.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>Let me first explain what I did as calculation because it's
important</p>
<p>Then I'll talk about the implications including how healthy vaccinee
effect may well be taken into account and how the figures should be
read</p>
<p>OK? Well you have no choice :-)</p>
<p>A study looked at all cause and covid mortality 12 months after
vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna based on national data in
Florida</p>
<p>What I hadn't realized so far is that the authors provided the data
of all-cause deaths and covid deaths among Pfizer and Moderna
vaccinees</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fisch-2.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>So here is the data: One needs to realize that these are the deaths
of ALL Pfizer and Moderna 1st dose in Florida but only counted as of the
moment someone got it's 1st dose</p>
<p>So it's not a timely defined figure (as in <span class="quote">"these
are all deaths from date X to Y"</span>)</p>
<p>But</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fisch-3.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>I wondered :-)</p>
<p>if I calculate the ratio by age (so the % of deaths vs. all deaths
among vaccinated), how does this compare to the same ratio for the whole
population of Florida</p>
<p>Of course, I need to look at 12 months going forward data from Jan to
Aug 2021 to compare</p>
<p>So I opened CDC wonder, downloaded all the data, did the usual tricks
to get the actual covid deaths per month by age (and unlock most of the
<span class="quote">"suppressed"</span> data)</p>
<p>And did the calculation: here is the result</p>
<p>You see the values are relatively flat - I am in luck!</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fisch-4.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>So now all I did is compare the relative ratio of covid vs. all cause
mortality among the mRNA vaccinated (as per data in the study) with that
of Florida I just calculated</p>
<p>And you see that the mRNA vaccinated had lower percentages of covid
mortality than the general public</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fisch-5.jpg width=550>
</div>
<p>Let's move to the interpretation</p>
<p>The first conclusion is that the unvaccinated died at a
proportionally higher rate than the mRNA vaccinated</p>
<p>(Florida administrated a little bit of Janssen but it hardly impact
the overall picture: Moderna and Pfizer made the massive bulk)</p>
<p>However, anyone who has done vax-unvax data during covid knows that
there is a thing called healthy vaccinee effect</p>
<p>This will play here as well BUT remember, what I calculated here is a
RELATIVE covid mortality vs. each group's all cause so this should
attenuate the effect</p>
<p>One other thing in my chart is that, oddly enough, the 80+ have <span
class="quote">"only"</span> 0,8 of the Florida average which sounds as
if <span class="quote">"it's relatively not great"</span></p>
<p>This is not the case!</p>
<p>Remember, in the 80+, a huge % was vaccinated. If we say 90%, then
0.8 is still well a covid % mortality well below average</p>
<p>Also, the study excluded care settings which have a much higher
mortality than the general public</p>
<p>So: this data is not <span class="quote">"bad"</span>, on the
contrary!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levi et al. wrote: <span class="quote">"Deaths were attributed to
COVID-19 if a corresponding ICD-10 code was listed either as the primary
or underlying cause of death on the death certificate."</span>
[<a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.25326460v2.full.pdf>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.25326460v2.full.pdf</a>]
By the primary cause of death, they probably meant that the cause
appears on the first line of the first part of the death certificate,
which is what the CDC calls the <span class="quote">"immediate cause of
death"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf</a>]
It's not clear if they meant the first item on the first line or any
item on the first line, because usually there's only one item on the
first line but sometimes there's multiple items. But in any case, CDC
WONDER doesn't support retrieving deaths by immediate cause of death, so
it's not possible to retrieve data from CDC WONDER using the same
definition of COVID death that was used in Levi's paper.</p>
<p>In the fixed-width files for the NVSS data, each multiple cause of
death has a field that is 6 characters wide, where the first character
shows the part and line of the death certificate, and the last 4
characters show the ICD code.
[<a href=https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/mortality/Multiple-Cause-Record-Layout-2021.pdf>https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/mortality/Multiple-Cause-Record-Layout-2021.pdf</a>]
Depending on which definition of immediate cause of death you use, you
can either select causes that appear at any position of the first line
of part I, or causes that appear as the first item on the first line of
part I. I used the latter definition here:</p>
<pre>wget ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/mort2021us.zip;unzip mort2021us.zip
awk &#39;substr($0,20,1)!=4{isucd=substr($0,146,4)==&quot;U071&quot;;ismcd=0;isimm=0;for(i=1;i&lt;=20;i++)if(substr($0,167+(i-1)*7,4)==&quot;U071&quot;){ismcd=1;if(i==1)isimm=1}ucd+=isucd;imm+=isimm;mcd+=ismcd;ucdorimm+=isucd||isimm}END{print ucd,mcd,imm,ucdorimm}&#39; VS21MORT.DUSMCPUB_r20230320.txt</pre>
<p>The output shows the number of COVID deaths by underlying cause,
multiple cause, immediate cause, and immediate or underlying cause:</p>
<pre>416893 462193 145379 417049</pre>
<p>The number of deaths by immediate or underlying cause is nearly the
same as the number of deaths by underlying cause alone. So it won't make
much difference if you only retrieve deaths with underlying cause COVID
at CDC WONDER but you don't additionally include deaths with immediate
cause COVID.</p>
<p>I got similar results as Jean Fisch here:</p>

of 75% efficacy before Omicron and 50% after Omicron by Ioannides</a>
</h3>
<p>In July 2025 John Ioannides et al. published a paper where they
estimated that about 2.5 million deaths were averted by COVID
vaccination in 2020-2024. They wrote: <span class="quote">"We assume VE
equals 75% (sensitivity range, 40%-85%) before Omicron and 50%
(sensitivity range, 30%-70%) during Omicron."</span>
[<a href=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2836434>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2836434</a>]</p>
<p>Their assumption was criticized by Raphael Lataster, who wrote: <span
class="quote">"So, first big issue, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for
death (VE). They claim VE of 75% then 50% post-omicron. Citing 2
sources. The first is a non-gold-standard study of very limited scope,
and which did not control for the healthy vaccinee bias (ironically
something Ioannidis has done research on)."</span>
[<a href=https://okaythennews.substack.com/p/debunked-landmark-covid-vaccine-study>https://okaythennews.substack.com/p/debunked-landmark-covid-vaccine-study</a>]
He also wrote: <span class="quote">"Moving on to another critical issue,
VE waning. They say they've already factored waning in their 75%/50%
figures which just sounds like a complete cop-out, especially when
there's no transparency."</span></p>
<p>In order to estimate vaccine efficacy against death while
simultaneously adjusting for HVE, waning efficacy over time, and
unvaccinated people acquiring natural immunity over time, you can look
the ratio of
<code>(unvaccinated COVID ASMR / vaccinated COVID ASMR) / (unvaccinated non-COVID ASMR / vaccinated non-COVID ASMR)</code>.
In the ONS dataset the ratio is close to 4 on average in 2021 and 2 in
2022, which corresponds to 75% efficacy before Omicron and 50% efficacy
after Omicron:</p>

<p>I also tried using the Czech NZIP data to calculate a ratio of
<code>(unvaccinated COVID ASMR / vaccinated COVID ASMR) / (unvaccinated non-COVID ASMR / vaccinated non-COVID ASMR)</code>.
The ratio was lower than 4 on average in 2021, but it's partially
because unvaccinated people are missing a lot of deaths in early 2021.
And it's also because COVID deaths are undercounted in the NZIP data,
which you can see from how unvaccinated people have a big spike in
non-COVID ASMR during the Delta wave:</p>

<p>The COVID deaths in the ONS dataset are deaths where COVID was
mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, or what is called multiple
cause of death in the United States. In my plot for the ONS data, part
of the reason why the 4-way ASMR ratio dropped in 2022 might be because
the ratio of UCD to MCD COVID deaths went down, or at least that's what
happened in the United States after the emergence of Omicron:</p>

<p>When he said the unvaccinated CMR remained flat, he was talking about
the CMR at the start of his x-axis before the Delta wave.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic had a high percentage of unvaccinated people
compared to other countries like England or Japan, so unvaccinated
people didn't have a very large spike in mortality during the rollout of
the primary course doses.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that the increase in vaccinated mortality in
2021 wouldn't have been due to the HVE. The vaccinated CMR was about
2,000-3,000 per 100,000 in mid-2021. People born in 1940-1949 were 71 to
81 years old in 2021, but the Czech CMR for ages 71-81 was about 3,700
to 4,000 per 100,000 in 2015-2019:</p>

<p>Kirsch started his x-axis from week 24, so you couldn't see that
earlier in 2021 unvaccinated people had a spike in deaths, even though
it was mostly because of COVID deaths and not the straggler effect:</p>

<p>His use of fixed cohorts also downplayed the magnitude of the Delta
spike in unvaccinated people, because on week 48 when deaths during the
Delta wave peaked, his unvaccinated cohort actually consisted of about
35% vaccinated people and 65% unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>Kirsch also posted this reply to his tweet:</p>

It's not reasonable to assume that unvaccinated people would continue to
have 3 to 5 times higher mortality than vaccinated people
indefinitely.</p>
<h3>
<a href=#KCORv3 id=KCORv3>KCORv3</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch described a new version of his KCOR formula in this
spreadsheet:
<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/KCOR/blob/main/KCORv3.xlsx.><a
href="https://github.com/skirsch/KCOR/blob/main/KCORv3.xlsx"
class="uri">https://github.com/skirsch/KCOR/blob/main/KCORv3.xlsx</a>.</a>
His spreadsheet included these comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The problem with KCORv2</strong></p>
<p>The problem with the KCORv2 original formula: we have perfect data
for both cohorts, no harm, and the slope should be =1 but it isn't if
the cohorts are on significantly different parts of the Gompertz curve.
You only get no drift in the cum ratio if the slopes are identical.</p>
<p>What I assumed was frailty due to static HVE would impact only the
scalar term in Gompertz, not the slope. That was an incorrect assumption
in the full Gompertz model. Two cohorts, vaxxed v. unvaxxed, with the
exact same age will have dramatically different slopes if static HVE is
strong, which it is for the COVID vax.</p>
<p>Two cohorts of different ages, works fine. They have nearly identical
slopes.</p>
<p>But two cohorts where one is vaxxed and other other isn't, is a
completely different story. MASSIVE slope differences due to HVE even if
the same age.</p>
<p>My big mistake: I thought the vaxxed and unvaxxed would essentially
act like different ages (e.g., similar increase in slope over a
year)</p>
<p>This is why KCOR curve kept climbing over time when it should have
asymptoted to a flat slope. This observation is nonsensical since the
total Czech population deaths were NOT climbing significantly (net harm
was small).</p>
<p><strong>KCORv3 simply adds a slope normalization step to the raw
data. That's it.</strong></p>
<p>if we adjust the death per week by removing the slope caused by the
static HVE differences between the cohorts, each cohort will die with
slope 0 over time. Then we apply normal KCOR to those adjusted death
counts.</p>
<p>NOTE the side benefit that the normalization is that it PROVES statis
HVE is static because we can normalize the unvaxxed (with high HVE) to a
straight line death slope using a fitted simple exponential.</p>
<p>Also, incorporated in this new version is an updated Czech input data
where dupllicate deaths were removed by removing all lines with
infection &gt;1. The Czech dataset had full records if you got &gt;1
infection so if you got 3 infections and died, you died 3 times instead
of 1.</p>
<p><strong>The three step correction approach to fix the
slopes</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We measure the unvaxxed slope post vaccine rollout by fitting an
exponential to death minimums on an 8 week moving avg death/wk
curve<br></li>
<li>We measure the whole population slope pre-vaccine (this is generally
0 for a full population due to Gompertz)<br></li>
<li>We derive the vaxxed slope from the two values above (see param
derivation tab for the simple formula). The reason we can't measure the
slope is because the vaccine itself can cause harm so we want to only
correct for the expected slope for a safe vaccine which is the
population slope-the unvaxxed slope as described in the formula on the
param derivation tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>So:<br> population deaths per week pre vax = A*exp(a1*t)<br> unvaxxed
deaths/week = B*exp(a2*t)<br> vaxxed slope is a3 which is derived from
A, B, a1, and a2 in a simple slope equation. See param derivation for
details</p>
<p>In Czech, for all ages, we have A=2000, B=900, a1=0, a2= -.00213 (a
declining deaths/week for fixed cohorts from fitting the unvaxxed
deaths/week).</p>
<p>Using the formula, we get a3=.001739 (see param derivations).</p>
<p>To do the <span class="quote">"correction"</span> of raw values in
the spreadsheet we use the opposite sign, e.g., we increase the deaths
in the unvaccinted cohort and reduce the deaths in the vaccinated.
That's why the opposite sign is entered in the tables here.</p>
<p>unvaxxed slope (start is 6/14/21; end is Cutoff is 5/27/24 for the ).
Get <strong>-0.00213</strong> for the slope per week where t is in
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Curve fitting details</strong></p>
<p>For the unvaxxed curve fit, only select local minimums that are LOWER
than the previous local minimum and were the point is the lowest in a +-
2 week period before and after the point.</p>
<p>For pre-vax, use 2020 from 4/20/2020 to 8/24/2020 but that's going to
be inaccurate so eyeball it in this case since not a log of data. looks
like 0 over the long term and that make perfect sense (see plots tab).
For all ages, the slope =0.</p>
<p><strong>Sanity checks:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>KCOR should stabilize with an <strong>asymptote</strong> to
<strong>approaching 1 at the far end</strong> (vax harm/benefit wears
off and back to normal relative mortality). This is true no matter if
the vaccine was a net harm or benefit; <strong>it should asymptote to 1
from below (e.g., vaccine beneficial) or from above (if vaccine
temporarily harmful).</strong></li>
<li>In Czechia, the KCOR total effect should be modest because the total
population death rate increase was modest.</li>
<li>The unvaxxed after adjustment should be relatively flat over time
for the line through the troughs</li>
<li>The total deaths before vax rollout vs. shortly after shouldn't be
lower than baseline population deaths</li>
<li>The vaccine should never progressively lower your risk of death
during non-COVID so the vaccinated adjusted deaths/week curve should
never decline over time (it doesn't make you healthier).</li>
<li>Similarly, the unvaccinated deaths/week should be flat over
time</li>
<li>same sum: <strong>Total adjusted deaths for the population (vaxxed +
unvaxxed) = actual unadjusted sum (we are just adjusting slope). This is
a powerful sanity check. KCOR can't be showing growing harm if the raw
total population deaths aren't growing.</strong></li>
<li>if there is a large net benefit from dose 1 vs. 2, it's like harm as
the differences in <span class="quote">"benefit"</span> from one vs. 2
shots is a fraction of the total benefit wchich is a fraction of ACM
benefit</li>
<li>Fit of the unvaxxed curve should be strong (r2 of 95% or
better)</li>
<li>Baseline can now be set at the start by measuring unvaxxed
deaths/week and subtracting from baseline deaths. This is the ratio. No
more 8 week period needed!! Just a good stable unvaxxed number which can
be easily seen from the trendline through troughs</li>
<li>Note that the slope will be more negative for frailer cohorts. So in
all ages Czech, the unvaxxed have the negative slope so will have an NPH
issue (will look like it harmed them).</li>
<li>if you go out long enough, if you got everything right, it will
asymptote back to no harm (1 line) after the shots wear off their
damage. This is a very powerful sanity test.</li>
<li>To get static HVE, use CMR ratio of individual age ranges since
those are the most likely to die. This shows no vax benefit (3x HVE will
give 1.7 expected ratio which is what we observe.</li>
<li>the most important factor is the baseline adjustment factor...where to
set the <span class="quote">"no change"</span> line. Ideally this should
be set at the ratios at t=0 to capture everything but that datapoint can
be noisy. If we got it right, the dose 1 shot should normalize at 1 at
the end of 2024 because there would be just the minor protection during
covid that would fade away and asymptote to 1. <strong>so it's a great
sanity check.</strong></li>
<li>There really isn't much of an HVE effect when we wait 3 weeks from
cohort definition. Dose 2 people, if there was HVE, would be leaving the
deaths with the Dose 1 group and since Dose 1 group is small, it would
be VERY noticeable if that happened.</li>
<li>There are only two slope parameters: one for the vaxxed, one for the
unvaxxed. If we got it right, all THREE lines have flat slopes of the
troughs. The differences will be in the middle, e.g., after shot
given.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>He demonstrated the problem with this calculation, where both
unvaccinated and vaccinated deaths followed an exponential curve with
the formula <code>b*exp(a*t)</code>.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-kcor3-1.png width=850>
</div>
<p>Both curves in his plot are concave, but the vaccinated curve should
be convex. After adjusting for seasonal variation and excluding COVID
waves, the mortality of vaccinated people roughly follows an exponential
decay subtracted from a constant term:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hvetest-6.png width=530>
</div>
<p>Therefore he should've added a constant term <code>c</code> to his
formula: <code>c+b*exp(a*t)</code>. So his curves should've looked
something like this:</p>

<p>In this plot Kirsch fitted an exponential function against the local

</div>
<p>The exponential function he fitted to the data looks close to a line.
His x-axis started around mid-July 2021, when the curve for unvaccinated
ASMR had already dropped a lot from the peak which was in March 2021
(even though it was partially because unvaccinated people had a lot of
COVID deaths during the Alpha wave, and the ratio between unvaccinated
and vaccinated ASMR only peaked a bit later):

<p>Kirsch's plot had a fairly big drop in unvacinated deaths between the
low points in 2023 and 2024, but it's because the NZIP data is missing
more deaths in 2024 than 2023. Kirsch claimed that the NZIP data was not
missing deaths until late 2024, but I showed him that about 5% of deaths
are missing from the second quarter of 2024:</p>

<p>In the KCORv3 spreadsheet Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"KCOR
can't be showing growing harm if the raw total population deaths aren't
growing"</span>. In his initial KCOR analysis he found that among people
born in 1950-1954, the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated deaths was
about 1.23 times higher between week 23 of 2021 and week 34 of 2022 than
between week 23 of 2021 and week 25 of 2021, so he declared it meant
that <span class="quote">"the vaccines caused a 23% net mortality

<p>People born in 1950-1954 were 71-75 years old at the end of 2021,
which was close to the middle of Kirsch's observation period. In my

However <code>a*exp(b*x)</code> ended up being close to a line even in
the next plot. That doesn't prove that HVE is static, but it shows that
you need to add a constant term to model the unvaccinated curve:</p>

<p>However the fit to the local minima is not a good representation of
the exponential decay in deaths due to the HVE. The unvaccinated deaths
had already dropped a lot before they reached the minimum in 2021. And
mortality displacement explains a part of the drop between the minima in
2021 and 2022, because unvaccinated people had high COVID deaths in the
winter of 2021-2022.</p>
<p>In my plot the red cross in 2024 is about 7% lower than the average
of the two red crosses in 2023, but most of the decrease is because
about 5% of deaths are missing in the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Even when I plotted unvaccinated deaths as a percentage of total
deaths, <code>c+a*exp(b*x)</code> still had a poor fit to the curve
during the first weeks:</p>

<p>In the adjustment that Kirsch did for KCORv3, he derived the slope
for vaccinated people from the slope for unvaccinated people by assuming
that the total deaths in unvaccinated and vaccinated people combined
would've remained constant. However if he would've fitted the
exponential curve against the local minima in vaccinated people, his
curve would've had a completely different slope (even though the curve
without a constant term would've still been close to linear):</p>

<p>The next plot shows that Kirsch's method of adjusting for the slope
of unvaccinated deaths is confounded by mortality displacement, because
unvaccinated people had such high mortality in the winter of 2021 to
2022 that they have a big drop in expected deaths between mid-2021 and
mid-2022:</p>

fooled himself with his dose 3 vs dose 2 plot</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch posted this plot, where he showed that the ratio mortality
rate for people with three doses relative to people with two but not
more doses increased by a factor of about 2.5 between early 2022 and
early 2023, where the way he expected people to interpret the plot is
that dose 3 was killing more people over time, which would've explained
the increase in the ratio:
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1953345748348588424>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1953345748348588424</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fooled-1.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The spreadsheet in his GitHub repository shows why he said there was
nothing to see in his plot, because in fact the number of deaths under
doses 2 and 3 combined remained stable over time, but if the reason why
the ratio went up was that dose 3 was killing more people over time,
you'd expect the number of deaths under doses 2 and 3 combined to also
go up over time:
[<a href=https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/main/analysis/fixed_cohort_HR.xlsx>https://github.com/skirsch/Czech/blob/main/analysis/fixed_cohort_HR.xlsx</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-fooled-2.png width=550>
</div>
<p>Kirsch tried to fool his followers, but I told Kirsch that he was
fooling himself. He says that <span class="quote">"dynamic HVE"</span>
or short-term HVE or HVE proper lasts only 3 weeks, but after there
remains <span class="quote">"static HVE"</span> which he also calls the
<span class="quote">"selection bias"</span>, which he says has a roughly
constant magnitude over time. However his plot shows that the ratio
between dose 3 and dose 2 follows a curve that takes several months to
flatten out. So how can that be <span class="quote">"static
HVE"</span>?</p>
<p>I guess the increase here is also because of dynamic HVE on weeks 0-2
but static HVE from week 3 onwards:

<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hvetest-7.png width=550>

<p>Also it's not correct to say that the ratio of CMR for dose 3 divided
by dose 2 is a hazard ratio, but it's rather a rate ratio:</p>

</h3>
<p>Kirsch claimed that Moderna vaccines had no benefit on all-cause
mortality based on the clinical trial, where both the vaccine group and
placebo group had 16 deaths:
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1958236828420772340>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1958236828420772340</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-modernabenefit-1.png width=550>
</div>
<p>However the trial was not powered to detect a difference in all-cause
mortality.</p>
<p>The Czech NZIP data shows that during the Delta peak in December
2021, COVID ASMR as a percentage of total ASMR was the lowest for
Moderna, and it was the highest for the two non-mRNA vaccine brands:</p>

in Czech data among people with non-zero DCCI</a>
</h3>
<p>Kirsch made a plot of the Czech data where he selected people whose
DCCI comorbidity score was 1 or higher, but he got a massive sustained
increase in the vaccinated mortality rate starting from the Omicron
wave. He posted the plots below (where I added the annotation to the
plot on the left), and he wrote:
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/the-czech-republic-dataset-provides>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/the-czech-republic-dataset-provides</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the Czech data, we can show that <strong>if you have two
cohorts with the same mortality</strong> rate, but one is vaccinated and
the other is unvaccinated, <strong>their all cause mortality (ACM)
during COVID waves was the same!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>It wasn't the vaccine. It was their underlying mortality rate
differences that caused the apparent benefit. </strong></p>
<p>Here are two different examples (one with all ages, the other with
people with 1 or more comorbidities):</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-dcci-1.webp width=750><img src=i/rootclaim-dcci-2.webp width=750>
</div>
<p>And Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"<strong>Your mortality
increased over 6 months then plateaued.</strong> If you got vaccinated,
your mortality rate increased to a new level over time. If you were
unvaccinated, there was no mortality increase. You can see that from the
charts above. The mortalities track until after peak COVID. The
mortality rate of the unvaccinated return to baseline. The mortality
rate of the vaccinated remains elevated. They were matched before and
now they are suddenly not matched because the vaccine separated their
mortalities."</span></p>
<p>The DCCI score is only included for people with one or more cases,
and there was a massive number of new people with a case added during
the Omicron wave, so many people first got a DCCI score assigned during
the Omicron wave.</p>
<p>Kirsch ignored vaccine doses given on week 25 of 2021 or later. But
the denominator he used to calculate his mortality rate was the number
of people who had ever had a case, including people who had not yet had
a case but who later ended up getting a case, which is similar to the
value of the top right panel at the end of the x-axis in my next plot.
He should've instead used the number of people who had had a case so far
as the denominator, which is shown by the line in my top right panel. Or
he should've excluded all people who didn't have a first case listed
before on week 24 of 2021 or earlier, like in my bottom right panel:</p>

<p>In the top right panel in the plot above, the population size of both
unvaccinated and vaccinated people increases about 50% between week 1
and 20 of 2022. But a large part of the increase is because of younger
age groups which account for few deaths. So in the next plot where I
included only people born in 1959 and later, vaccinated people clearly
have a bigger percentage increase in population size between week 1 and
week 20 of 2022:</p>

<p>I showed the plot below to Kirsch and asked him: <span

unvaccinated people had a much higher hospitalization rate than
vaccinated people in 2021, then why does the line in my bottom panel
here remain close to 1 from mid-2022 onwards? Why did the <span

<p><span class="quote">"NPH"</span> or <span
class="quote">"non-proportional hazards"</span> is a term that Kirsch
has bastardized to mean that unvaccinated people have a higher COVID
mortality risk than vaccinated people even after adjusting for HVE,
which he invokes to explain why unvaccinated people were dropping like
flies during the Delta wave. But in terms of the profile of
comorbidities that makes people suspectible to die from COVID or be
hospitalized with COVID, the composition of unvaccinated people probably
doesn't change too much between the Delta wave and late 2022. So then
why is the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated hospitalization
rate much higher during the Delta wave than in late 2022?</p>
