<p>Kirsch wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people getting Dose 2 are drawn from the Dose 1 recipients. If there is a 1%/day HVE effect, we'd see it because the Dose 1 cohort would have decreasing deaths over time to mirror the increasing deaths in Dose 2 because HVE is a zero sum game.</p>
<p>Check it out: flat line for Dose 1 (orange curve). And since Dose 1 cohort is small, leaving those people behind would create a massive effect, much larger than the impacts on Dose 2 because it's a transfer of an absolute number of people because HVE is a zero sum game on absolute counts.</p>

<p>In order to get fixed cohorts of people by dose number, Kirsch determined the vaccination status at the end of week 24 of 2021. Therefore he didn't have to adjust the deaths for population size since the population sizes remained roughly constant from week 25 of 2021 onwards, apart from depletion due to deaths and change due to migration.</p>
<p>However the period when people with only one had the lowest mortality due to HVE was before week 25 of 2021. In Kirsch's plot the number of deaths in people with only one dose remained around the same level between weeks 11 and 24 of 2021. But if you look at ages 60 and above which accounted for about 90% of total deaths in the Czech Republic in 2021, the population size of people with only one dose tripled from about 400,000 on week 11 to about 1,200,000 on week 20, and by week 25 it had falled back down to about 400,000 after people had moved under the second dose. By week 25 of 2021, ages 60 and above had about 4 times as many people with two or more doses as people with only one dose:</p>

<p>Kirsch's AI said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This level of bias is enormous. For comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world HVE estimates in high-quality studies (e.g., flu vaccine studies in seniors) are generally in the <strong>1.1–1.2</strong> range (10–20%).</li>
<li>A 3.0 ratio would be <strong>unprecedented</strong> and <strong>easily visible in every time-series ACM dataset</strong>, including non-COVID vaccination campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="should-be-obvious-in-the-data">2. Should Be Obvious in the Data</h3>
<p>If this bias exists:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd expect a dramatic <strong>dip in ACM for the vaccinated group</strong> immediately after rollout, across <em>all</em> countries, <em>all</em> age groups, and <em>all</em> vaccines. NOTE: This dip is sustained and <strong>would appear in calendar time</strong>, not just in the time series.</li>
<li>It would also imply that the <strong>unvaccinated group had catastrophic mortality</strong>, which contradicts many population-level trends (e.g., Czech Under-80 cohort, US CDC mortality by vaccination status in early 2021).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirsch's AI seems to have copied his mistaken understanding of what a time series means. Kirsch says that a plot where the x-axis shows time since vaccination and the y-axis shows deaths is a <span class="quote">"time series"</span> plot, even though in reality a plot where the x-axis shows calendar time is also a time series plot. In his Substack Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"But did you know that none of the papers in the peer reviewed scientific literature will show you a time series plot for the COVID vaccine? I couldn't find a single one!"</span> [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/covid-time-series-graphs-show-clearly>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/covid-time-series-graphs-show-clearly</a>] So I guess under his definition of a time series plot, he didn't even count survival analysis plots where the x-axis shows days since since-vaccination and the y-axis shows probability of survival, because during the debate he has referred to several survival analysis plots that were published in peer-reviewed papers.</p>
<p>But anyway, the HVE does in fact appear in plots that show mortality by calendar date. In the English ONS data, Dutch CBS data, and Japanese FOI data released by Kenji Fujikawa, there ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated ASMR reaches above 4 during the vaccine rollout: [<a href=rootclaim4.html#Comparison_to_other_datasets>rootclaim4.html#Comparison_to_other_datasets</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-cum-comparison.png width=530>
</div>
<p>There are also many studies which have shown more than a 3-fold difference in all-cause mortality between unvaccinated and vacinated people. In the same PDF file Kirsch wrote about a Norwegian study which looked at all-cause mortality in people aged 70 and above during the first three weeks after vaccination. Even though the cohorts were matched for variables like 5-year age group and comorbidity index, the vaccinated group had a mortality HR of only about 0.28 relative to the unvaccinated group, with a 95% CI of about 0.24-0.31.

<p>Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"The Levi result, which showed vaccine harm, shouldn't be very surprising as <strong>it matches what an expert group appointed by the Norwegian Medicines Agency found</strong> when it looked at the cause of death of 100 people who died after vaccination and <strong>found that 36% of the deaths may have been vaccine mediated</strong> (<span class="quote">'likely'</span> to <span class="quote">'possible'</span>). After they found that result, they decided that further confirmation was unwise. Nor did they warn the people of Norway; they suppressed the result. They did not publish their findings in the peer-reviewed literature. They did not publicly report the findings through standard scientific channels. Sadly, this is how <span class="quote">'science'</span> works today: <strong>if you find something that goes against the narrative, you bury it</strong>."</span></p>
<p>The paper Kirsch talked about was published in Norway's primary peer-reviewed medical journal. [<a href=https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination>https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2021/05/originalartikkel/nursing-home-deaths-after-covid-19-vaccination</a>] The Wikipedia page about the journal says: <span class="quote">"The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Norwegian: Tidsskrift for Den norske legeforening) is a biweekly peer-reviewed medical journal published by the Norwegian Medical Association and established in 1881. It includes research and review articles, news stories, and debates about professional issues and education, as well as discussion of medical education. The journal has been indexed by Index Medicus, MEDLINE, and PubMed since 1965."</span> [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Norwegian_Medical_Association>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Norwegian_Medical_Association</a>] Perhaps Kirsch was confused by the design of the journal's website, which looks more like an informal magazine site than a medical journal, or he was confused by how the website publishes both formal scholarly articles and more informal content.</p>
<p>The Norwegian paper said: <span class="quote">"In the period 27 December 2020 to 15 February 2021, about 29 400 of Norway's roughly 35 000 nursing home patients were vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. During the same period, the Norwegian Medicines Agency received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse reactions to the vaccine."</span> The paper also said: <span class="quote">"The mean age of the patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported deaths, a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10 cases, possible in 26 and unlikely in 59."</span></p>
<p>So among approximately the 29,400 first vaccinated people in nursing homes, a causal connection between vaccination and death was considered probable or possible in the case of 36 people, which is a rate of about 0.1% and not 36%. In the case of some reports, the vaccination may have only been a minor contribution to the death of someone who was about to die soon anyway. If it was possible to determine definitively how many of the 100 people died primarily due to vaccination, it would probably be less than 36 people, even though there might of course be additional vaccine-induced deaths with no adverse event report filed.</p>
<p>But anyway, the results of a study are not applicable to the general population, because the proportion of adverse event reports that involve death out of all adverse event reports is higher in older people than younger people. And elderly people who live in nursing homes have even higher mortality rates than age-matched elderly people who live on their own.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the Norwegian paper said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spontaneous reporting system for adverse drug reactions is primarily useful for generating hypotheses and is not particularly suitable as a basis for assessing causality. Many of the reports did not contain sufficient clinical information to form an impression of the patient's clinical course and a possible causal link between vaccination and death. Almost half of the reporting parties did not submit additional information. In particular, there was a lack of information about which phase of life the patients were in, and whether their health and general condition were already rapidly or slowly deteriorating before vaccination. All patients were in a complex clinical situation characterised by old age, frailty and multiple chronic diseases, which means that a variety of factors could have contributed to the deaths. It is therefore practically impossible to determine with any certainty how much of a role the vaccine played in the deaths.</p>
<p>The extremely high mortality rate in nursing homes means that random factors will lead to a certain number of deaths shortly after vaccination anyway. It cannot be ruled out that some of the deaths that were classified as probable are in fact due to such random factors. Nevertheless, we find it reasonable to assume that adverse effects from the vaccine in very frail patients can trigger a cascade of new complications which, in the worst case, end up expediting death.</p>
<p>The categories <span class="quote">'probable'</span> and <span class="quote">'unlikely'</span> were used in cases where the expert group considered there to be a clear likelihood one way or the other, and the category <span class="quote">'possible'</span> was used where a causal link between vaccination and death was just as likely as unlikely. Many of the cases classified as <span class="quote">'possible'</span> are therefore very uncertain, and some of them could perhaps also have been categorised as unclassifiable. The group considered far more cases to be either probable or unlikely than the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in its initial assessment. This is probably due to access to more information as well as knowledge of typical clinical courses in frail elderly people.</p>
<p>The adverse reaction reports were submitted within a period of approximately 50 days, during which it can be assumed that 2000–2500 nursing home patients died in Norway (7). Whether 10 or 36 of these deaths were accelerated by the vaccine, the proportion is still low. In the same period, almost 30 000 nursing home patients were vaccinated, which means that there will most likely have been far more than 100 deaths in nursing homes in a close temporal relationship to vaccination in the relevant time period. Our findings cannot therefore be used to estimate the incidence of vaccine-related deaths.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the vast majority of long-term patients in nursing homes have a short remaining life expectancy. They are definitely in the final stage of life. This is reflected in the expert group's scoring of 48 out of 79 classifiable patients in CFS category 8 or 9, which indicates an expected lifespan of less than six months.</p>

<p>By a difference of less than 1%, he probably referred to how the adjusted odds ratio for non-COVID mortality was about 1.356 in the matched cohorts and 1.361 in the unmatched cohorts: [<a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.25326460v1>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.25326460v1</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However the odds ratios were adjusted for a similar set of variables that was used to do the matching. The cohorts were matched by age, sex, race, ethnicity, vaccination site, month of second dose, and census tract. The adjusted odds ratios were adjusted for all the same variables except month of second dose, and the adjustment for census tract was done in a different way, and they were additionally adjusted for mortality at the ZIP code level.</p>
<p>So even though both methods produced an odds ratio of about 1.36, in both cases it might be due to confounders that were not adjusted for using either method.</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"Furthermore, there was no systematic nor systemic bias in the distribution of vaccines in Florida."</span></p>
<p>Howveer if you look at the full unmatched cohorts in Table 1 of Levi's study, the median age was 54 for Pfizer but 62 for Moderna. The median social vulnerability index score was about 47 for Pfizer but 41 for Moderna.</p>
<p>The unadjusted all-cause mortality odds ratio was about 0.853 between the unmatched cohorts but 1.374 between the matched cohorts.</p>
<p>Kirsch also wrote that there is no <span class="quote">"evidence anywhere of a systematic bias that could cause a vaccine preference within a facility"</span>. Among Levi's full cohorts, the percentage of vaccine doses where the site type was doctor's clinic was about 21% for Pfizer and 11% for Moderna. But the percentage for hospital ER was about 0.7% for Pfizer and 1.9% for Moderna, and <span class="quote">"other pharmacies"</span> was about 2% for Pfizer and 11% for Moderna:</p>

<p>The Czech Ministry of Health has also published a CSV file which shows the number of vaccine doses administered by vaccinator name. When I calculated an age-normalized proportion of doses administered by senior homes, it was much higher for Moderna than Pfizer.

<p>Kirsch wrote: <span class="quote">"The time series plots for Pfizer and Moderna using the Czech data show that both vaccines increase mortality shortly after the shots were given."</span> By the <span class="quote">"time series plots"</span>, he meant his plots where the x-axis showed times since vaccination and the y-axis showed deaths. However just because there is a low number of deaths in the first few weeks after vaccination, it doesn't mean that</p>
<p>However glass half full perspective, you might just as well say that both vaccines reduce mortality more in the days after vaccination than later on.</p>

<p>Kirsch calculated the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated people using the raw number of deaths, so that he treated people who were vaccinated after the end of week 41 of 2021 as unvaccinated. In his spreadsheet the ratio of deaths per week in the COVID period relative to the baseline period was about 1.362 in unvaccinated people and about 1.227 in vaccinated people, so by subtracting the two numbers Kirsch got a figure of about 0.135 for his mortality benefit in vaccinated people.</p>
<p>In the following code I did a similar calculation using ASMR so I didn't have to rely on Kirsch's hack of defining people vaccinated after a given date as unvaccinated. Now the ratio of ASMR in the COVID period divided by ASMR in the baseline period was about 1.478 in unvaccinated people had about 1.236 in vaccinated people, so by subtracting the two numbers I get a figure of about 0.242, which is almost twice as high as Kirsch's figure:</p>

<p>However it would've been more appropriate to calculate the mortality benefit as <code>1-vax/unvax</code>, and not as <code>unvax-vax</code> like Kirsch. So if the ratio of mortality in the COVID period relative to the baseline period would've been 5 in unvaccinated people and 3 in vaccinated people, then vaccinated people would've had a 40% mortality benefit, and not a 200% mortality benefit.</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote this about an analysis of Japanese FOI data published by Kenji Fujikawa: [<a href=https://medicalfacts.info/vdeath.rb>https://medicalfacts.info/vdeath.rb</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sent me his posts and his website where you can validate this information. Below is the most interesting graph on his page:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hudikaha-1.png width=1084>
</div>
<p>What is undeniable is that the <strong>average mortality rate doubles in just ONE year (from 5,000 to over 10,000)</strong> in a fixed age group (80+) where the average mortality rate for the entire group should be relatively constant over time (it's a zero sum game; all the cohorts should average to the same number each period). In one year, at the start of 2022, 90% are in Dose 2, hardly anyone is left in Dose 1, and the rest are unvaccinated. The bars for Dose 0 and Dose 2 are the same height (at 10,000). So the total mortality of the entire group is nearly double what it was a year ago and it was NOT driven by the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated mortality went DOWN and the vaccinated mortality went up.</p>
<p><strong>This is NOT HVE</strong> because HVE effects don't modify POPULATION means, HVE simply impacts cohorts.</p>
<p><strong>There is no other way to explain this data other than the vaccinated (which is by far the largest group) significantly increased their mortality.</strong></p>
<p>This is CLEARLY NOT <span class="quote">"1% HVE"</span> because HVE never changes total mortality… it just moves deaths between cohorts. Here you can see the <strong>total mortality of the ENTIRE COHORT DOUBLED. That's a HUGE problem for <span class="quote">"safe and effective."</span> There is no other way to spin it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However if you look at each semiannual group in Fujikawa's plot, the rightmost bar for the newest vaccine dose is always lower than the leftmost bar for unvaccinated people. Many of the doses in between have such a small population size that they don't have much impact on total vaccinated mortality.</p>
<p>After a large number of people has moved under the nth dose, the mortality rate of dose n-1 shoots up because of the straggler effect. But in the bottom panel here if you compare the gray line here against the black line, you can see that the mortality rate of all vaccinated people combined always remains lower than the mortality rate of unvaccinated people: [<a href=statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan>statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-yuukoku-7.png width=550>
</div>
<p>In the next plot shows the data but presented in a different way, where I'm plotting excess deaths each month relative to the mortality rate among all people included in the dataset the same month. The row for dose 1+ shows that vaccinated people have negative excess mortality each month, apart from April 2021 when only a very small number of people had been vaccinated. As the healthy vaccinee effect wears off, the excess mortality of vaccinated people gradually drops from about -55% in June 2021 to about -9% in November 2021:</p>

<p>The same FOI dataset also shows that unvaccinated people have bigger spikes in mortality during COVID waves than vaccinated people: [<a href=statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan>statistic2.html#Deaths_by_days_since_vaccination_in_Japan</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-yuukoku-13.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the previous plot if you look at the black line which shows the mortality rate of both vaccinated and unvaccinated people added together, there's a large increase in the mortality rate between 2021 and 2024. It's because the age of each person was determined at the time the data was extracted, so some of the people who were 80 years old at the data was extracted may have been only 75 or 76 years old in early 2021. [<a href=https://x.com/donkey1399/status/1923593814704521298>https://x.com/donkey1399/status/1923593814704521298</a>, <a href=https://x.com/hudikaha/status/1924666052409229765>https://x.com/hudikaha/status/1924666052409229765</a>]</p>
<p>This plot of the Japanese FOI data also shows that it takes about 120 days after vaccination for the deaths to reach a peak, which conflicts with Kirsch's claim that the curve for HVE flattens out after 3 weeks: [<a href=https://stop-mrna.sakura.ne.jp/db/lot_totalization.php>https://stop-mrna.sakura.ne.jp/db/lot_totalization.php</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-hudikaha-2.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above the reason why the deaths start to fall after day 120 is because people start getting new booster doses so they cycle back to day 0, and also because people who got a booster dose in 2024 start to run out of follow-up time. If people were kept under all previous vaccine doses after a new dose and if people wouldn't run out of follow-up time, the deaths would continue to increase even past day 120.</p>
