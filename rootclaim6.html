<p>Kirsch posted the plot below and wrote: <span class="quote">"Every
time you compare the two cohorts, the more vaccinated cohort will have
mortality even though they tracked at the start. This is NOT NORMAL. If
they track at the start, they should continue to track. If the shots
worked, the more vaxxed cohort would exhibit LOWER mortality, not higher
mortality."</span>

<p>By <span class="quote">"mortality"</span>, Kirsch meant the
cumulative number of deaths multiplied by a constant factor, where he
chose the constant factor so that his two lines were roughly aligned at
the start of the x-axis. But if by mortality you mean ASMR instead, then
the 4-dose cohort has lower mortality than the 3-dose cohort even at the
end of the x-axis.</p>
<p>At the start of the x-axis, people with 4 doses have reduced
mortality because of the healthy vaccinee effect, and people with 3
doses have elevated mortality because of the straggler effect. But over
time the ASMR of the two cohorts converges.</p>
<p>Kirsch aligned the lines so that they matched at the start of the
x-axis, but when the line for dose 4 subsequently rose above the line
for dose 3, Kirsch attributed the increase to harm caused by vaccines.
But if you align the lines so that they match at the end of the x-axis
instead, then it rather looks like dose 3 has high mortality at the
start of the x-axis relative to dose 4, which can be explained by the
straggler effect:

<p>Kenji Fujikawa has now published CSV files of FOI data from 7 cities
here: <a href=https://fujikawa.org/pub/kkcor/.><a
href="https://fujikawa.org/pub/kkcor/"
class="uri">https://fujikawa.org/pub/kkcor/</a>.</a> I used his files to
make the next plot, which shows that in late 2022 when the 4th dose is
rolled out, the mortality of people with 3 but not more doses shoots up
because of the straggler effect. But by late 2023 the straggler effect
has weakened, so people with 3 but not more doses have almost as low
mortality as people with 4 or more doses:</p>

that follows a constant minus an exponential decay is consistent with a

</h2>
<p>The mortality of vaccinated people as a function of time since
vaccination roughly follows a constant minus an exponential decay. The
mortality of unvaccinated people peaks during the rollout of the first
dose, but afterwards it falls following a curve roughly similar to an
exponential decay. In October 2025 Kirsch announced he had discovered a
third new type of HVE, which explained the drop in unvaccinated
mortality.
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/surprise-there-are-actually-3-types>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/surprise-there-are-actually-3-types</a>]</p>
<p>Kirsch claims the mortality of vaccinated people increases over time
because of harm caused by vaccines. I'd expect vaccine harm a function
of time since vaccination to follow an exponential decay, so that the
curve would go down and not up over time, in the same way that a curve
for the number of deaths by time since a car crash would look something
like an exponential decay. If vaccination triggered the development of a
chronic disease like cancer, where it resulted in a multiplicative
increase in illness that in turn resulted in further illness, the curve
of deaths over time might look like an exponential increase.</p>
<p>Out of the following options, I'd expect harm caused by vaccines to
primarily fall under 2, or possibly to a lesser extent 3, but not 1:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If mortality by time since an event looks like a constant minus an
exponential decay, it's consistent with the event being associated with
a factor that reduces mortality, but the magnitude of the factor decays
over time.</li>
<li>If the event has an impact which results in a direct increase in
mortality, but the effect of the impact gets weaker over time, you'd
expect the curve to look like an exponential decay.</li>
<li>If the event initiates a long-lasting development which causes
mortality to increase over time multiplicatively, you'd expect to curve
to look like an exponential increase.</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked Grok:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In human cohorts, give examples of events that result in the
following curves of mortality by time since the event:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Constant minus exponential decay</li>
<li>Exponential decay</li>
<li>Exponential increase</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An example is starting employment in an occupational cohort,
where the healthy worker effect leads to initially lower mortality rates
due to health selection at hire, which then gradually increase over time
(e.g., 15 - 20 years) and approach the constant level of the general
population as the effect wears off.</p></li>
<li><p>An example is birth, where infant and early childhood mortality
rates are high immediately after birth but decline exponentially with
age during the first few years of life.</p></li>
<li><p>An example is reaching adulthood (approximately age 30), after
which mortality rates increase exponentially with advancing age,
following the Gompertz law of mortality.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked Grok to give more examples of a constant minus
exponential decay, it replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Immigration to a new country, where the healthy migrant effect
leads to initially lower mortality rates among migrants compared to the
native population due to self-selection of healthier individuals, which
then gradually increase and approach or converge with host country rates
over time as the effect diminishes.</p></li>
<li><p>Becoming a blood donor, where the healthy donor effect results in
lower mortality rates initially due to health screening and selection
criteria excluding unhealthy individuals, with rates approaching those
of the general population over extended periods.</p></li>
<li><p>Participating as a volunteer in epidemiological or health
studies, where the healthy volunteer effect causes lower initial
mortality among participants due to self-selection of healthier
individuals, which then rises toward general population levels as the
cohort ages and the selection bias fades.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked ChatGPT to list phenomena in various sciences that
follow a function of constant minus exponential decay, and to group them
under categories like a return to an equilibrium, diminishing returns
over time, or an initial population selection effect, ChatGPT produced
this list:</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see how harm caused by vaccines could fall under any of the 5
categories listed above.</p>
<p>The healthy vaccinee effect doesn't really fit into any category
either, even though it's akin to the inverse of the examples listed
under the 4th category of <span class="quote">"selective or attritional
stabilization"</span>. All examples under the 4th category were
formulated as a probability of survival after initial attrition, similar
to how the survival probability of unvaccinated people increases over
time as the straggler effect wears out. But it's not really comparable
to HVE, which could rather be characterized as an increasing risk of
failure in a population that was initially selected to include members
with a low risk of failure, but where over time new members develop a
high risk of failure. You pointed out how the Mirror of Erised paper
said: <span class="quote">"the risk of death from non-COVID causes was
up to five times lower among vaccinated individuals during periods with
negligible COVID-19 mortality"</span>. They referred to Figure 1 and
Figure 2, which showed people born in 1940-1949 only. In other age
groups the peak ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality was
not as high.</p>

<p>Kirsch wrote that the paper about the Czech FOI data showed that
there was an up to 5-fold <span class="quote">"static healthy vaccinee
effect"</span>:

<p>Jeffrey Morris coined the terms <span class="quote">"temporal"</span>
and <span class="quote">"inherent"</span> HVE, which he later renamed to
<span class="quote">"time-varying"</span> and <span
class="quote">"time-invariant"</span> HVE. Kirsch seems to employ the
terms <span class="quote">"dynamic"</span> and <span
class="quote">"static"</span> HVE as synonyms for the terms coined by
Morris. The inherent/time-invariant/static HVE refers to the plateau
level of HVE after the initial temporal/time-varying/dynamic HVE has
worn off.</p>
<p>However in the Mirror of Erised paper, the ratio between unvaccinated
and vaccinated mortality reached close to 5 only temporarily around
April to June 2021, when the first dose was rolled out. So the 5-fold
difference was attributable to <span class="quote">"dynamic HVE"</span>
and not <span class="quote">"static HVE"</span>:

<p>In the heatmap below if you exclude cells that have a wide confidence
interval due to a small sample size, the only cell where the ratio
between unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality is above 5 is the cell for
ages 60-69 in May 2021. And if you look at the bottom row which shows
all ages combined, the highest monthly ratio is about 3.2 in May 2021,
and the total ratio in 2021-2022 is about 2.1:</p>

in Czech Republic up to 2025</a>
</h2>
<p>Kirsch interprets the results of his Czech KCOR analysis to mean that
vaccinated people had sustained high excess mortality since 2021. But
about 90% of deaths in the Czech Republic are in ages 60 and above, and
based on the FOI data, about 86% of people aged 60 and above were
vaccinated at the end of 2022:</p>
<pre>t=fread(&quot;curl -Ls github.com/skirsch/Czech/raw/refs/heads/main/data/CR_records.csv.xz|xz -dc&quot;)
s=t[!(!is.na(DatumUmrti)&amp;DatumUmrti&lt;&quot;2022-12-31&quot;)]
t[2022-Rok_narozeni&gt;=60,mean(!is.na(Datum_1))]
# 0.8555016</pre>
<p>So if vaccinated people had something like 30% extra deaths like
Kirsch claims, the overall Czech population should also have close to
30% extra deaths.</p>
<p>However the next plot shows that the ASMR was clearly lower in 2023
and 2024 than in the years before COVID, and even relative to the
2010-2019 linear trend, there was still close to 0% excess ASMR in 2023,
2024, and 2025:</p>

<h2>
<a href=#Deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination_in_Czech_data id=Deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination_in_Czech_data>Deaths
by weeks after vaccination in Czech data</a>
</h2>
<p>Kirsch published a Substack post where he showed plots of deaths by
weeks since vaccination in the Czech data.
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/time-series-analysis-of-the-czech>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/time-series-analysis-of-the-czech</a>]</p>
<p>He wrote: <span class="quote">"AFAIK, this is the first time anyone
has done a time series analysis on the Czech data"</span>. Kirsch has
bastardized the term <span class="quote">"time series analysis"</span>
to mean an analysis similar to a plot that shows deaths on the y-axis
and weeks since vaccination on the x-axis, even though I have told him
that a plot that shows calendar date on the x-axis is also a time series
plot. So by the normal definition of what a time series plot means,
Kirsch has posted many time series plots of the Czech data himself.
However even by his bastardized definition of a time series plot, I have
made many plots of the Czech data that have shown time since vaccination
on the x-axis, and I have shown many of the plots to Kirsch on DM on
Twitter, so he should be aware of them.</p>
<p>Kirsch wrote:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However among the elderly age groups that account for most deaths,
many people got the first dose during the Alpha wave around March 2021,
so during the first few weeks from the first dose, the background
mortality rate dropped rapidly as the Alpha wave was passing by. But
people typically got the second dose within 3-6 weeks of the first dose,
so by that time the background mortality rate no longer dropped as
sharply, and also there had been sufficient time for an immune response
to build up after the first dose, so the risk of death from COVID was
reduced:
[<a href=czech4.html#Plot_for_raw_deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination>czech4.html#Plot_for_raw_deaths_by_weeks_after_vaccination</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-rawweek.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>The reason why Kirsch originally started to claim that the HVE lasted
for only 3 weeks is that when he plotted deaths by days after
vaccination in his US Medicare data, it took about 3 weeks for the
deaths to reach a flat level:
[<a href=czech.html#Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose>czech.html#Deaths_by_weeks_after_first_dose</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/czech-weekafter-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>However it's because a lot of people got first doses near the end of
the COVID wave in winter 2020-2021, so there was a rapidly falling trend
in the background mortality rate during the first few weeks from
vaccination. The plot above shows the first known vaccine dose for each
person administered in 2021, which was generally but not always the
first dose. This plot shows that vaccine doses administered in 2022 take
much longer to reach a flat level, and they follow a more smooth curve
that is missing the bump in deaths around days 20-30: [ibid.]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-medicare-15.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>But anyway, the main point of Kirsch's post were these plots, where
he compared people who got the second dose in February against people
who got the second dose in June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, all ages, vaccinated in Feb. This is an older mix of people.
The vaccine is perfectly safe because elderly have a weak immune system.
HVE ends promptly on dot #3 just as I promised it would. There is
basically nothing to see here. This is precisely what a safe vaccine
should look like.</p>
<p><img src=i/rootclaim-febvsjun-1.webp width=500><br> <em>Dose 2 given
in Feb 2021. All ages. Older age mix. Starting at week 3, HVE is long
gone and you have baseline mortality.</em></p>
<p>Now, let's time shift 16 week later by looking at the same group
(younger mix this time) vaccinated in June instead of Feb.</p>
<p>So we'd expect to see 2 differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A much lower y-intercept since our population mix is
younger,</p></li>
<li><p>the flat portion should last only 15 weeks before rising since we
started 16 weeks later.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Population mortality was uniformly flat for all ages since May 17,
2021 until COVID wave starts up on Sep 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Surprise! If you got a COVID shot and were not super old, your
mortality was not flat.</p>
<p>Mortality rose by 50% by week 15 when it should have been be
flat.</p>
<p>That's huge. What confounder can explain that?</p>
<p><img src=i/rootclaim-febvsjun-2.webp width=500><br> <em>All ages,
vaxxed in June 2021 with Dose 2. Here's adj h(t) over time. Your
baseline mortality lifted by around 50% in just 15 weeks after the shot.
That's hard to explain if the shots were safe, isn't it?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The baseline seems to be roughly halfway between the second and third
weeks in the first plot, and halfway between the third and fourth weeks
in the second plot, so I don't know why Kirsch didn't determine the
baseline the same way in both plots.</p>
<p>But anyway, in the next plot I split people into three groups
depending on the month of the first vaccine dose. Week 0 consists of the
day of vaccination and the next 6 days. People vaccinated in January or
February have a peak in deaths on week 2, and people vaccinated in March
or April have a peak in deaths on week 3, but the early peak is missing
in people vaccinated in May or June, because at that point there was no
longer a decreasing trend in background mortality rate because the COVID
wave had already passed by. However the baseline has a much bigger drop
during the first 10 weeks for the first two groups and a smaller drop
for the third group. So once you plot the deaths as a percentage of the
baseline, in all three groups the percentage reaches a plateau around
week 20:
[<a href=rootclaim5.html#Does_short_term_HVE_last_for_3_weeks_in_the_Czech_FOI_data>rootclaim5.html#Does_short_term_HVE_last_for_3_weeks_in_the_Czech_FOI_data</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/rootclaim-czweeksbimonth.webp width=500>
</div>
<p>Kirsch keeps arbitrarily assuming that the number of deaths 3 weeks
after vaccination is the baseline, or sometimes 2.5 weeks or 3.5 weeks
or 4 weeks, and any subsequent increase in deaths means that vaccines
are killing people.</p>
<p>He should've instead calculated the baseline deaths using the method
I employed in the plot above. It's really easy if you use my <span
class="quote">"buckets"</span> files that show the number of deaths and
person-days for each combination of variables like week since
vaccination, observation month, and age.
[<a href=czech.html#Bucket_analysis>czech.html#Bucket_analysis</a>]</p>
<p>For example this code shows the row from my buckets file for people
aged 80, who got a Pfizer vaccine for their first dose in March 2021,
and who were 21-26 days from the first dose in April 2021:</p>
<pre>t=fread(&quot;https://sars2.net/f/czbucketskeep.csv.gz&quot;)
t[month==&quot;2021-04&quot;&amp;age==80&amp;vaxmonth==&quot;2021-03&quot;&amp;week==3&amp;dose==1&amp;type==&quot;Pfizer&quot;]
#   month age vaxmonth week dose   type alive dead
# 2021-04  80  2021-03    3    1 Pfizer 57589    5</pre>
<p>In my buckets file people are kept under the first dose even after
receiving the second dose, so in order to not count people with multiple
doses multiple times, you have to exclude people whose dose number is 2
or higher.</p>
<p>The following code calculates the baseline number of deaths per
person-days for each combination of age and observation month:</p>
<pre>base=t[dose&lt;=1,.(base=sum(dead)/sum(alive)),.(age,month)]</pre>
<p>So basically you get a matrix of baseline mortality rates like this,
where each combination of age and month has its own baseline of deaths
per person-days:</p>
<pre>base[month%like%&quot;2021-0[1-6]&quot;&amp;age%in%80:84,round(xtabs(base~age+month),5)]
#     month
# age  2021-01 2021-02 2021-03 2021-04 2021-05 2021-06
#   80 0.00026 0.00023 0.00024 0.00017 0.00014 0.00012
#   81 0.00031 0.00027 0.00030 0.00023 0.00016 0.00016
#   82 0.00034 0.00027 0.00031 0.00023 0.00018 0.00016
#   83 0.00035 0.00034 0.00037 0.00024 0.00022 0.00020
#   84 0.00043 0.00041 0.00042 0.00028 0.00023 0.00021</pre>
<p>From the table above you can see that the baseline mortality rates
are about twice as high in January 2021 as June 2021.</p>
<p>Then the baseline mortality rate is multiplied by the person-days to
get the baseline deaths, and the total baseline deaths for each number
of weeks after vaccination are added together:</p>
<pre>a=merge(t[dose==1],base)[,.(dead=sum(dead),base=sum(base*alive)),,week]</pre>
<p>And finally this code shows the deaths as a percentage of the
baseline during the first 30 weeks from the first dose, where you can
see that it takes about 15 weeks for the deaths to settle at a level of
about 80-90% of baseline deaths:</p>
<pre>round(a[,pct:=dead/base*100])[1:30]

<p>I have given Kirsch R code similar to the code above multiple times,
but I think he has never yet made use of my code. In 2023 when Kirsch
released his analysis of Barry Young's New Zealand data, he hired some
guy to write a Python script for him that generated <span
class="quote">"buckets"</span> files similar to the files I have later
generated for the Czech data. However I have never seen Kirsch use my
buckets files or generate his own buckets files for the Czech data, even
though they would make many types of analysis much easier, like for
example calculating a baseline for deaths that is adjusted for age and
the background mortality rate.</p>
