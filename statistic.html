Spieker: US summer of deaths in 2021</a>
</h2>
<p>Fabian Spieker published a Substack post where he presented the
hypothesis that many of the COVID deaths in summer 2021 in the United
States were caused by <span class="quote">"vaccine-medicated enhanced
disease"</span>, since in the southeastern states which had a massive
wave of COVID deaths in the summer of 2021, many people who had
previously not been vaccinated were getting their first vaccine dose
around the same time.

<p>Kirsch posted this tweet:
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1750573957856792983>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1750573957856792983</a>]</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>However the states where people were still getting first shots in
August 2021 tended to have a low percentage of vaccinated people. I got
a correlation of about -0.55 when I included all ages and all sexes and
I looked at the percentage of vaccinated people in August 2021 and not
the percentage of people who got the first shot in August 2021:</p>
<div width="000">
<img src=i/debunk-kirsch-aug2021-2.webp width=600><img src=i/debunk-kirsch-aug2021-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>In the southeastern states which had the highest number of COVID
deaths per capita in August 2021, there was also a spike in PCR
positivity rate which slightly preceded the deaths:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-kirsch-aug2021-4.webp width=1200>
</div>
<p>In fact the plot above shows that the spike in PCR positivity was
short-lived like the spike in excess deaths, so both PCR positivity and
excess deaths had fallen back near zero around November 2021, even
though the daily number of new vaccine doses remained elevated until
around March 2022. So the excess deaths not only rose in sync with PCR
positivity rate but they also fell in sync after the PCR positivity rate
fell down. And the same thing happened again during the Omicron
wave.</p>
<p>In Florida there is only a small peak in vaccine doses around August
2021 when deaths peaked, and new vaccine doses remained around the same
level until the end of 2021. But there was a sharp drop in PCR
positivity rate which was followed by a sharp drop in excess
mortality:</p>

<a href=#Comparison_to_Medicare_data id=Comparison_to_Medicare_data>Comparison
to Medicare data</a>
</h3>
<p>In February 2023 Kirsch published a spreadsheet of data from
Medicare, which includes the dates of vaccination and dates of death of
about 110,000 vaccinated people who died between December 2020 and
January 2023:
[<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/i/104943824/the-medicare-data-that-i-received>https://kirschsubstack.com/i/104943824/the-medicare-data-that-i-received</a>,

<p>Compared to the total US population which also includes unvaccinated
people, the vaccinated people who are included in the Medicare
spreadsheet have reduced mortality during the Omicron wave in January
2022 and the Delta wave in August to September 2021, and in fact the
bump in deaths during the Delta wave seems to be almost flat among the
vaccinated people:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-connecticut-4.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>If you only look at ages 15-44 in Kirsch's Medicare spreadsheet, the
sample size is so small that it's diffficult to tell if there's actually
an increase in deaths in August 2021 or not:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-subset1544.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>In the Medicare data there's also a reduced number of deaths in the
first weeks following a vaccination. For example in people who were
vaccinated in August 2021, there's only 9 deaths during the first week
from vaccination and 11 deaths the next week, but during later weeks the
average number of deaths is about 25:</p>

<p>In the Medicare <span class="quote">"all states subset"</span> sheet,
if you look at the five southeastern states which had the highest number
of COVID deaths per capita in August 2021, there's a low number of
all-cause deaths in recently vaccinated people in July and August 2021.
Among people who were vaccinated in August, there's only 6 deaths in
August even though the average date of vaccination was on August 16th so
August consists of roughly half a month, and the average number of
deaths on subsequent months was about 17.5 which is almost 3 times
higher than 6:</p>

<a href=#Comparison_to_Guam id=Comparison_to_Guam>Comparison to Guam</a>
</h3>
<p>In Guam there was also a spike in COVID deaths and PCR positivity
rate in September 2021:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-guam-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>A report about COVID death at Guam said: <span class="quote">"Though
overall vaccination coverage in Guam is high with 93.5% of the eligible
population (age ≥5) vaccinated as of 1/22/2022, among individuals who
died of COVID-19 in Guam in 2021 with known vaccination status, over 80%
were not fully vaccinated."</span>
[<a href=https://dphss.guam.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Guam_covid19_DOA_2021_Report_2_1_2022_FINAL.pdf>https://dphss.guam.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Guam_covid19_DOA_2021_Report_2_1_2022_FINAL.pdf</a>]
According to Table 1 of the report, there were 132 deaths in people with
a known vaccination status, but 102 of the people were unvaccinated,
which is about 77%:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/nopandemic-guam-3.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>In July to August 2021 there were also news reports that the demand
for vaccines had incresed in southeastern states because of the Delta
wave. For example an article about Louisiana published in early August
2021 said:
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/us/louisiana-vaccines-covid-delta.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/us/louisiana-vaccines-covid-delta.html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when Madeline LeBlanc relented and got her first vaccine dose
this week, she was motivated by something entirely different: fear.</p>
<p>After seeing news reports about the Delta variant raging across the
state, Ms. LeBlanc, 24, had come to see that without a vaccine, she
risked not just her own life but those of others around her. <span
class="quote">"I don't want to be the one inhibiting someone else's
health,"</span> said Ms. LeBlanc, who lives in Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Demand for the shots has nearly quadrupled in recent weeks in
Louisiana, a promising glimmer that the deadly reality of the virus
might be breaking through a logjam of misunderstanding and
misinformation.</p>
<p>The new push for vaccinations has been driven by an explosion in
coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>When I tried comparing the daily number of COVID deaths in 2021 to
daily new vaccine doses given, I got a negative correlation for most
states, and the correlation got even lower when I shifted the dates of
death 10 days into the past. However when I compared daily COVID deaths
to PCR positivity rate instead, I got a positive correlation for all
states, and the correlation increased even further when I shifted the
dates of death by 10 days:</p>

<p>And I got similar results when I looked at excess all-cause deaths
and not COVID deaths:</p>

<a href=#Comparison_to_Maldives_data_published_by_Kirsch id=Comparison_to_Maldives_data_published_by_Kirsch>Comparison
to Maldives data published by Kirsch</a>
</h3>
<p>In December 2023 Steve Kirsch published a spreadsheet of data from
the Maldives, which appears to include the dates of death for all or
almost all of citizens of the Maldives who died in 2021-2022, even
though it's missing some deaths in 2020 and 2023.
[<a href=moar.html#Data_for_deaths_in_2020_2023_in_Maldives>moar.html#Data_for_deaths_in_2020_2023_in_Maldives</a>]
The spreadsheet also includes the dates of vaccination of each person,
and it includes a column for cause of death, including whether the death
was attributed to COVID. During the peak in COVID deaths in May 2021,
over half of all deaths are listed as COVID deaths, which are indicated
by a pink background color:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-maldives-2.jpg width=1100>
</div>
<p>The plot below shows that in May 2021 when there was the highest
number of deaths, there were 122 deaths in unvaccinated people and 81
deaths in vaccinated people. And in May 2021 the percentage of
unvaccinated people was 41.992% based on the average daily percentage of
unvaccinated people at OWID, so based on the calculation
<code>(122/41.992)/(81/(100-41.992))</code>, unvaccinated people had
about 2.1 times higher mortality than vaccinated people in May 2021.
However on months with a lower number of COVID deaths, the ratio between
unvaccinated and vaccinated mortality was lower, which seems to indicate
that the vaccines prevented COVID deaths (even though it could also be
that healthy people were more likely to get vaccinated and healthy
people were less likely to die of COVID):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/moar-maldives-1.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>Most deaths are of course in older people, and in most countries
older people are more likely to be vaccinated than younger people. So if
you took a weighted average of the percentage of vaccinated people in
each age group where the weight was the number of people in the age
group in Kirsch's spreadsheet, you'd probably get a much lower
percentage of unvaccinated people than the percentage in the total
population.</p>
<p>This plot also shows that the spike in deaths in May to June 2021 was
much higher in unvaccinated people (even though it could partially be
because people who had been vaccinated in March 2021 still had reduced
mortality in May because of the temporal healthy vaccinee effect):</p>

</h3>
<p>The heatmap below shows that in southern states in summer 2021, there
was a particularly high percentage of COVID deaths in ages 0-54 out of
all COVID deaths. It could be because young people were less likely to
be vaccinated than old people, but maybe by 2022 young people had
natural immunity so the vaccine offered less competitive advantage to
older people, or maybe by 2022 more young people had gotten vaccinated

code</a>):</p>

</div>
<p>I also tried calculating the percentage of vaccinated people in ages
25-49 as a percentage of the percentage of vaccinated people in ages 65
and above. It was only about 55% in Alabama in August 2021 but it was
90% in Massachusetts, which might explain why Alabama had a higher
percentage of COVID deaths in younger age groups than Massachusetts (and
in fact in my previous heatmap Massachusetts had the lowest percentage
of COVID deaths in ages 0-54):</p>

<p>My heatmap below shows that compared to the winter 2020-2021 wave,
the Omicron wave also seems to have killed a disproportionate number of
young people, which might be because young people were less likely to be
vaccinated than old people.</p>
<p>Each row has its own color scheme where the maximum value is black
and zero is white. If you look at the colors of the squares during the
summer 2020 wave, ages 60-69 have a higher color than older age groups,
even though people were not yet vaccinated in summer 2020. However it
could be because seasonal variation in mortality is greater in older age
groups, so maybe older age groups also have more COVID deaths in winter
relative to summer. But what complicates things further is that during
the summer 2022 wave, older age groups again have a higher color than
younger age groups.</p>

<p>Kirsch posted this tweet which showed that 4 out of the 5 biggest
counties in Georgia had higher excess mortality in 2021 than 2020:
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1751828835405082658>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1751828835405082658</a>]</p>

<p>However the excess mortality for 2020 includes the period before
COVID in January and February (even though Georgia was one of the
southern states which already had fairly high excess mortality in
March).</p>
<p>The spikes in excess deaths also coincided with spikes in PCR
positivity rate, and there was low excess mortality around April 2021
when vaccine doses peaked:</p>

<p>However in a bulletin for week 21 of 2023, EUROMOMO announced that
they started including data from spring 2023 onwards in their baseline
calculation:
[<a href=https://www.euromomo.eu/bulletins/2023-21>https://www.euromomo.eu/bulletins/2023-21</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a long period with elevated overall European mortality through
the COVID-19 pandemic, the European mortality (both totally for the
entire population and in all age groups) is by spring 2023 within the
expected level. Therefore, data from spring 2023 and onwards will be
included in the estimations of the expected mortality. During the
pandemic years, the usual patterns of mortality have been disrupted
because of the unexpected and varying excess mortality experienced due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the assumption that there is
no elevated mortality in certain weeks in spring (week 16-25) and autumn
(week 37-44) did not hold. Therefore, to avoid biasing the estimations
of the expected mortality, data from the pandemic years (2020-2022) were
excluded from the estimations of the expected mortality. Normally, the
estimation of the expected mortality is based on data from a five-year
period. However, when data from the three pandemic years are excluded
from the estimations, the oldest data currently used is up to 8 years
old. This means that until 2028, both data from the pre- and
post-COVID-19 pandemic periods will be included in the estimations of
the expected mortality.</p>

Craig: Mortality rate by percentage of vaccinated people in US

</h2>
<p>Clare Craig posted this plot which appears to show that in US
counties which had a higher percentage of vaccinated people in 2022, the
2021 mortality rate minus 2020 mortality rate tended to be higher than
in counties with a lower percentage of vaccinated people:

<div>
<img src=i/debunk-craig-county-1.jpg width=480>

<p>However actually her plot shows the mortality rate in 2020 minus the
mortality rate in 2021. With 2021 minus 2020 I got the opposite
trend:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-craig-county-2.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>In Craig's plot the county which had about 9% vaccinated people was
Long County, Georgia, which had a higher mortality rate in 2021 than
2020 on CDC Wonder, so it should've been above zero on the y-axis in her
plot. This plot also shows that the county with about 9% vaccinated
people had a higher mortality rate in 2021 than 2020:

<p>Craig also posted this tweet where she used the same CDC dataset for
vaccinations by county, but she plotted the
<code>Completeness_pct</code> column and not the
<code>Administered_Dose1_Pop_Pct</code> column:

<p>It's not clear why there's such a drastic difference between the two
columns (or why the values of the <code>Completeness_pct</code> column
seem to fall to a certain fixed set of values where other values in
between are omitted):</p>

<p>I posted the Dutch CBS data here:

the CSV files from sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.8 here:

<p>I didn't include the confidence intervals, because there's a bug on
the website of the CBS where it doesn't include decimal separators for
the upper end of the CI, so if for example the upper end of the CI is
listed as 149, you can't tell if it's supposed to be 149 or 14.9 or
1.49.</p>

<p>The plot below shows that compared to the number of deaths in January
2022, the spike in all-cause deaths in December 2021 was a lot higher in
unvaccinated people than vaccinated people. (The unvaccinated population
size gets smaller over time as more people get vaccinated, but only a
small number of people got their first vaccine dose between the start of
December 2021 and the end of January 2022.)</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-aukema-4.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Vaccinated people have lower non-COVID ASMR than unvaccinated people
because of the healthy vaccinee effect, but you can adjust for it if you
divide COVID ASMR by all-cause ASMR. But even then the ratio in
unvaccinated people is much higher during the COVID wave in December
2021:</p>

<p>The Netherlands had a high number of influenza cases in December
2022, which might explain why there was a high number of deaths even
though there was a low number of COVID deaths:
[<a href=https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWU4YjUyN2YtMDBkOC00MGI1LTlhN2UtZGE5NThjY2E1ZThhIiwidCI6ImY2MTBjMGI3LWJkMjQtNGIzOS04MTBiLTNkYzI4MGFmYjU5MCIsImMiOjh9>https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWU4YjUyN2YtMDBkOC00MGI1LTlhN2UtZGE5NThjY2E1ZThhIiwidCI6ImY2MTBjMGI3LWJkMjQtNGIzOS04MTBiLTNkYzI4MGFmYjU5MCIsImMiOjh9</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-aukema-5.jpg width=900>
</div>
<p>Germany also had a spike in all-cause mortality in December 2022
which coincided with a spike in influenza-like illness even though there
was a low number of COVID deaths:</p>

<h3>
<a href=#All_cause_ASMR id=All_cause_ASMR>All-cause ASMR</a>
</h3>
<p>Even though adding together ratios is not correct in many cases, in
the case of this dataset the denominators for COVID and non-COVID ASMR
are the same, so it's possible to calculate all-cause ASMR by adding
together COVID and non-COVID ASMR like in this example:</p>
<pre>&gt; stdpop=c(70000,30000)
&gt; t=read.table(header=T,text=&quot;
+ age  pop  dead_covid dead_non_covid
+ 0-49 2345 3          28
+ 50+  1234 11         98&quot;)
&gt; asmr_covid=sum(t$dead_covid/t$pop*stdpop)
&gt; asmr_noncovid=sum(t$dead_non_covid/t$pop*stdpop)
&gt; asmr_total=sum(rowSums(t[,3:4])/t$pop*stdpop)
&gt; asmr_covid+asmr_noncovid
[1] 3575.292
&gt; asmr_total
[1] 3575.292</pre>
<p>So if you calculate all-cause ASMR by adding together COVID and
non-COVID ASMR, it's much higher in unvaccinated people than vaccinated
people, even though the difference gets smaller over time which is
probably because the impact of the temporal healthy vaccinee effect gets
weaker:</p>

<h3>
<a href=#Excess_mortality_compared_to_other_variables id=Excess_mortality_compared_to_other_variables>Excess
mortality compared to other variables</a>
</h3>
<p>Netherlands is a bad country for calculating a Rancourtian
correlation between all-cause mortality and new vaccine doses given,
because the first two doses were rolled out between COVID waves when
there was low excess mortality. And the first booster was also given
earlier than in other countries where it happened to coincide with the
Omicron wave, and for some reason Netherlands had a almost no deaths
during the Omicron wave even though the number of cases and PCR
positivity were high. So unlike many other countries, Netherlands didn't
have a spike in deaths in January 2022 which would've coincided with the
rollout of the first booster. Now there's minor bumps in all-cause
mortality which coincide with the rollout of the 4th and 5th doses, but
if the 4th and 5th doses were killing a bunch of people then why wasn't
there also an increase in all-cause mortality when the first three doses
were rolled out?</p>

<h3>
<a href=#Percentage_of_COVID_deaths_in_vaccinated_people id=Percentage_of_COVID_deaths_in_vaccinated_people>Percentage
of COVID deaths in vaccinated people</a>
</h3>
<p>Aukema also posted the plot below which shows that vaccinated people
accounted for about 82% of COVID deaths.
[<a href=https://x.com/waukema/status/1763512462412845432>https://x.com/waukema/status/1763512462412845432</a>]
However according to the ECDC's vaccine tracker, about 96% of the Dutch
population of ages 60 and above had been vacccinated by December 2021,
and after that the percentage remained at 96.3% until 2023.
[<a href=https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab>https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab</a>]
The percentage might be too high, because in other countries the
percentage of vaccinated people in elderly age groups sometimes reaches
over 100% (and for example in New Zealand similar statistics were based
on the Health Service User population where unvaccinated people are
underrepresented, because many people who were not previously included
in the population were added to it after they got vaccinated). But
anyway, in the elderly age groups which account for most deaths, the
percentage of vaccinated people is still probably much higher than
82%.</p>

<h3>
<a href=#Heatmap_for_monthly_COVID_and_non_COVID_ASMR id=Heatmap_for_monthly_COVID_and_non_COVID_ASMR>Heatmap
for monthly COVID and non-COVID ASMR</a>
</h3>
<p>The heatmap below shows that in February 2021 among people who had
not been insured for long-term care, vaccinated people had about twice
as high ASMR as unvaccinated people, which might be because vulnerable
groups of people were priorized during the early vaccine rollout.
However after that unvaccinated people had higher ASMR than unvaccinated
people almost every month, regardless of whether you look at COVID
deaths or non-COVID deaths or if you look at people in long-term care or
not. Among people who had not been insured for long-term care, there
were many months when unvaccinated people had over 10 times higher COVID
ASMR than vaccinated people. The last row of the bottom heatmap shows
that among people in long-term care, vaccinated people initially had
over 50% higher non-COVID mortality than unvaccinated people (which was
probably because of the healthy vaccinee effect), but the difference had
reached close to zero by the end of 2022:</p>

<p>In one plot Aukema double-counted deaths, so he had about 5000-7500
deaths per week even though it should've been half of that:

of fully vaccinated and vaccinated ASMR</a>
</h3>
<p>In the Dutch CBS dataset, there is one set of statistics where people
are considered vaccinated immediately after vaccination, and there is
another set of statistics where people are only considered as vaccinated
after they are fully vaccinated (which generally means that at least two
weeks had passed from the second dose):
[<a href=https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/rapportages/2024/covid-vaccinatiestatus-en-sterfte/2-methode>https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/longread/rapportages/2024/covid-vaccinatiestatus-en-sterfte/2-methode</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vaccination status <span class="quote">'vaccinated'</span> is defined
as <span class="quote">'fully vaccinated'</span> (i.e. two weeks after
two approved vaccinations, or a positive test at least 56 days for at
least one approved vaccination, or four weeks after vaccination where,
according to the vaccination certificate, one vaccination counts as
fully vaccinated, or when a booster or repeat injection has been given
without a known basic series) possible with boosters and repeat
injections. Vaccination status <span class="quote">'unvaccinated'</span>
is defined as no known vaccination or only one known vaccination without
previously reported infection (with the exception of the vaccine where
one vaccination counted as fully vaccinated).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plot below shows that in January and February 2021, unvaccinated
people had a spike in deaths which was missing from people who were not
fully vaccinated. It might be because vulnerable groups of people were
priorized during the earliest part of the rollout (even though based on
this data alone, I believe the possibility that some of the deaths were
caused by the vaccines cannot be ruled out either):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/debunk-aukema-12.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Actually fully vaccinated people have zero deaths until the week
ending February 21st. The recommended minimum duration between the first
and second dose was 3 weeks, so there was typically a delay of at least
5 weeks between the first vaccination and the time when a person was
considered fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>The plot above also shows that during the first half of 2021 when
there was still a fairly high number of new people getting vaccinated,
unvaccinated people had much higher ASMR than people who were not fully
vaccinated. It might be partially because of the temporal healthy
vaccinee effect, where recently vaccinated people have a reduced number
of deaths after vaccination, so conversely the people who remain
unvaccinated have temporarily elevated mortality during the vaccine
rollout. Or it could also be because the people who are not fully
vaccinated include the group of people who received only one dose but
not the second dose and the group of people who have recently received
the second dose. In the ONS dataset for mortality by vaccination status,
both of those groups of people had low mortality during the rollout of
the first two doses (even though later on they had higher mortality but
their population size was also much smaller)

<p>What is interesting is that despite comprising only 37% of

the recent period.</p>

<p>The results for 2020 confirm a modest advantage that we would expect
from the <span class="quote">"white privilege"</span>: Whites comprised
only 30% of deaths despite being 37% of the population.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence that White people are also more vaccinated and
boosted against COVID-19?</p>

<p>The more vaccinated and boosted race in California is accounting for
GREATER share of Covid deaths compared to their share of the population.
Meanwhile, Black and Hispanic Californians, who are less vaccinated,
account for fewer deaths than their share of the population would
suggest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However whites of course are older than Hispanics, so I tried
calculating ASMR from CDC WONDER:
<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html.><a
href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html"
class="uri">https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>.</a> I
set <span class="quote">"Group Results By"</span> to Year, 6-race
categories, and Hispanic status, and I set the underlying cause to U07.1
(COVID). I included the whole US and not just California, because when I
only included California, CDC WONDER didn't return population sizes and
there were more rows where the number of deaths was suppressed because
there were less than 10 deaths. I classified people with Hispanic status
under Hispanic and no other race.</p>
<p>In 2022 I got about 7% higher ASMR for Hispanics than whites. The
ratio was much higher in 2020, but it was also higher in 2021 even
though most people were vaccinated for most of 2021 in the elderly age
groups which account for most COVID deaths, so I don't know if the
change in the ratio was because of vaccination:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-caliage-3.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>Asians had lower ASMR than whites each year in 2020-2023. Whites had
about 5% higher ASMR than Asians in 2020, but it increased to 49% in
2021 and 74% in 2022. But Asians had higher vaccination rates than
whites, so it seems to conflict with Chudov's hypothesis that the ratio
between whites and Hispanics got lower after 2020 because whites were
more likely to be vaccinated. However it could also be that states where
Asians lived had more COVID deaths in 2020 relative to 2021-2023.</p>

COVID CMR in 2020-2023 was much higher among Hispanic people than
whites. But in ages 85+ Hispanics had only slightly higher CMR than
whites, which might be if whites are overrepresented in the upper end of
the 85+ age category relative to Hispanics. However for some reason in
the year 2023 Hispanics had lower COVID CMR than whites in all age

<p>Here's a plot of the same data:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-seychelles-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>I thought that the Facebook post may have meant 30% excess deaths
against a baseline of 2020, because in the code above I got about -20%
excess deaths for 2020 but 7% for 2021 and 6% for 2022. And in fact in
the Rumble video which was linked in the post, a figure of 38.5% excess
deaths in 2021 was calculated relative to a 2020 baseline:
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v1xv71w-seychelles-excess-deaths.html>https://rumble.com/v1xv71w-seychelles-excess-deaths.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-seychelles-2.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In the image above the figure of 21.4% seems to match a 2015-2019
average baseline: <code>925/((795+818+748+747+703)/5)</code>. But the
years 2015 and 2016 were not included in the plot so you couldn't see
clearly that there was an increasing trend in the yearly number of
deaths before 2020, so the 2015-2019 average baseline exaggerated excess
mortality in 2021.</p>
<p>Kirsch also posted this tweet:
[<a href=https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1818772830026449411>https://x.com/stkirsch/status/1818772830026449411</a>]</p>

<p>It looks like Henjin has better data for 2022: 941 deaths.</p>
<p>Seychelles 10 year avg (2011-2020) is 724</p>
<p>941/724=1.2997</p>
<p>which most people would say is a 30% increase above baseline which is
what I heard from my friend who lives there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However according to estimates from the UN's World Population
Prospects dataset, the population size of Seychelles also increased by
about 32% between 2011 and 2023. So a linear trend makes more sense than
an average baseline:</p>

<p>The excess deaths were concentrated in two spikes which coincided
with spikes in COVID deaths, but there was low excess mortality in the
first quarter of 2021 when most vaccine doses listed by OWID were
administered (even though I think OWID is missing booster doses):</p>

have never seen excess deaths amongst young working age Americans that
have suddenly risen in one quarter. So in the quarter 3 of 2021, you saw
100% rise in the deaths of people 15 to 44. [...] So you have to ask
yourself, what happened in the third quarter of 2021? And here's my
answer, that is when mandates proliferated, university, healthcare,
government, government contractors, schools."</span>

<p>However if the fairly small number of people who got vaccinated late
because of mandates had such high mortality, then why wasn't there also
high mortality earlier in 2021 when a much larger number of people got
vaccinated?</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-kory-mandates.webp width=700>

<p>The plot above also shows that the spike in deaths in the third
quarter of 2021 can mostly be acccounted by deaths where the underlying
cause was listed as COVID. And the all-cause mortality only increased by
about 20% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. However
in the second quarter mortality was already elevated relative to the
2019 average, even though it was partially because there has been a
sustained increase in drug deaths since 2020.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest means that the heart stops beating. A heart attack
occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, which can lead to
a cardiac arrest, but a cardiac arrest can also occur for other reasons.
The news story Kirsch linked said that the boy died of a heart attack,
but it might also be possible that he died of a cardiac arrest that was
not caused by a heart attack but the journalist who wrote the article
was not aware of the distinction.</p>
<p>The boy's GoFundMe page said:

(visaliapd instagram)</p>
<p>...Richard's heart stopped while enjoying time at Adventure Park...he was
having fun, running around...and being a normal kid. His first time of
death was at 5:58pm. However his last time of death was 9:26pm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I don't know if the underlying cause of death would be determined
based on the event at the waterpark, the <span class="quote">"first
death"</span>, the <span class="quote">"second death"</span>, or none of
them. So even in the case that he got a heart attack at the water park,
the underlying cause of death wouldn't necessarily be listed as a heart
attack.</p>
<p>The table by Kirsch only included deaths with the underlying cause
I46 (cardiac arrest). But there's also ICD codes for I21 (acute
myocardial infarction) and I50 (heart failure). Myocardial infarction is
the technical term for a heart attack. A heart failure means that the
heart is weakened but not necessarily stopped like in a cardiac
arrest.</p>
<p>CDC WONDER suppresses the number of deaths on rows with less than 10
deaths for privacy reasons. If you select ages 0 to 19 but disable
grouping the results by age to avoid the suppression, there's about 50
to 80 deaths per year with the underlying cause I46, but the number of
deaths is approximately doubled when you also include the underlying
causes I21 and I50:
[<a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html>https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-kirschheart-3.webp width=400>
</div>
<p>For some reason there's about 30 times as many deaths with MCD I46 as
deaths with UCD I46. At first I thought it might have been because of
deaths caused by recreational drugs, but actually there were only about
20 to 30 deaths per year with MCD I46 and a UCD related to recreational
drug use.</p>
<p>But anyway, there was an approximately 20% increase in deaths with
UCD I46 if the average of 2018 to 2020 is compared against the average
of 2021 to 2023. Some of it might be due to COVID or recreational drug
use, because there has also been a big increase in opioid deaths since
the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Kirsch wrote that <span class="quote">"VSRF's Nurse Angela knows of
15 kids, under 20, who died from cardiac arrest."</span> So if we assume
that the 20% increase could be entirely attributed to vaccines, then in
an alternate universe where no kids got a COVID shot, would Nurse Angela
know 12.5 kids who died of a cardiac arrest over the same period of time
when now there were 15 deaths? (Because 15 divided by 1.2 is 12.5.)</p>
<p>Kirsch didn't specify if Nurse Angela knew the kids personally or if
she just heard about them on social media or something. But in the
latter case she wouldn't necessarily have heard about them if she wasn't
following the news about deaths that might potentially be attributed to
vaccines. Or the number could've just been made up by either Kirsch or
Nurse Angela.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if Rancourt's baseline was calculated based on raw
deaths like at OWID or based on CMR. But in either case it's inaccurate
for Sweden because of the aging boomer population and because Sweden had
an unusually low number of deaths in 2019. In the plot below I
calculated the blue baseline based on the trend in CMR in 2015 to 2019.
But I think my green baseline is more accurate, and it's a lot higher
than the blue line especially in 2023 and 2022. There's still a small
number of excess deaths in 2023 even relative to my green baseline, but
it's not nearly as much as in Rancourt's plot:</p>

Cook: FOI response for presentations of chest pain in New Zealand in
ages 0 to 39</a>
</h2>
<p>In September 2024 Aly Cook published a FOI response which included
this table for the number of ED presentations for chest pain in ages 0
to 39:
[<a href=https://x.com/KiwiAly/status/1836636092436746346>https://x.com/KiwiAly/status/1836636092436746346</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-chestpain-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The number of presentations was only 111 in 2018 but about 200 times
higher in 2022, so it's clearly not a good proxy of the overall
incidence of chest pain in New Zealand. The response said that the
earliest approved data was from the year 2018, so it might for example
be that hospitals switched to some new system in 2018 but there was a
delay until different hospitals adopted the new system.</p>
<p>The same FOI response also included these tables for the number of
publicly funded hospital discharges in ages 0 to 39 with a primary
diagnosis of myocarditis or pericarditis, where there was no massive
increase in the post-vaccine era:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-chestpain-2.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The table of ED presentations was also featured in a PDF by some
Ayurvedic guru called Guy Hatchard, but he misleadingly omitted the data
for 2018 so you couldn't see as clearly that the early data appeared to
be incomplete:
[<a href=https://x.com/KiwiAly/status/1837645083107328235>https://x.com/KiwiAly/status/1837645083107328235</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-chestpain-3.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Philipp McMillan from Vejon Health did a video about the data for ED
presentations of chest pain, where he showed a plot where the data for
2018 was not omitted, but he didn't mention anything about how the
number of presentations was extremely low in 2018.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Q8VvBt6Ko&t=4m59s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Q8VvBt6Ko&amp;t=4m59s</a>]
And he didn't say anything about how the increase in ED presentations
did not necessarily reflect a true increase in the incidence of chest
pain, which seems to have been the common pattern when the data was
covered in alt media.</p>
<p>In the table from Aly Cook's FOI response for presentations of chest
pain in ages 0 to 39, there was an approximately 11668% increase in
presentations between 2018 and 2021, which is clearly too high to be
caused by vaccines. But in this plot for cardiac presentations in
Southern Australia in ages 15 to 44, there was an around 35% increase if
2021 is compared to 2018, which seems like it might be realistically
caused by the vaccines:
[<a href=https://x.com/WotsOnInfo/status/1778614447378141449>https://x.com/WotsOnInfo/status/1778614447378141449</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-chestpain-4.webp width=800>
</div>
<p>However even the 35% increase was for presentations and not
admissions, and maybe the increase would be lower if you would look at
admissions rather than presentations. Someone from New Zealand wrote:
<span class="quote">"The health system was on alert for both covid and
vax side effects, referring people to EDs for ECGs etc. Hell, I went to
the doctor with reflux and as I had a sore chest was sent to ED for an
ECG (which was fine). But it's still recorded chest pain. Admissions are
what matters"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Thoughtfulnz/status/1838832801875136805>https://x.com/Thoughtfulnz/status/1838832801875136805</a>]
And another person from New Zealand replied: <span class="quote">"Can
share my personal story. I presented for chest pain a few weeks after
vax. They told me to be in the lookout and get checked without
hesitation. Turns out I had a pulled muscle. You warn millions of people
about chest pain, a ton more are going to turn up. I am in those
stats"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/CloudyNetwork/status/1838834771776147797>https://x.com/CloudyNetwork/status/1838834771776147797</a>]
And then the first person replied: <span class="quote">"A workmate once
cancelled a meeting for a very similar story - taking the warnings
seriously they did what they were supposed to and went to the ER - and
it was a muscle strain. They would not have gone to the ER with that a
decade ago."</span></p>
<p>Uncle John Returns found the FOIA response that News Whisperer's plot
was based on. It also included data for admissions which was omitted
from News Whisperer's plot, but the admissions remained roughly flat
during the period when there was the increase in presentations:

<p>It's weird that the x-axis in the plot starts in 2017 even though the
baseline was fitted against data from 2015 to 2020. There was also a low
number of cancer deaths in 2020 partially due to reduced screening, so
including 2020 in the baseline fitting period artificially pulls the
baseline downwards.</p>
<p>In the plot below I took data for yearly deaths by underlying cause
of death from here:

However I wasn't able to produce Jikky's plot because I got lower deaths
in 2020 than 2019, and I got 52,348 deaths in 2023 even though in
Jikky's plot it's about 51,100. My plot also demonstrates how a
2014-2019 baseline is much steeper than a 2015-2020 baseline, because
there was a low number of deaths in 2014 which further makes the
baseline more steep, so the 2014-2019 baseline actually gave me negative
excess deaths in 2023:</p>

<p>However then I realized Jikky's plot used data for <span

For some reason the doctor-certified cancer deaths have had a sustained
elevation above the baseline since 2021. Unlike the previous dataset the
doctor-certified deaths were also higher in 2020 than 2019:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-jikkycancer-3.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>The dataset for doctor-certified cancer deaths has 49,609 deaths in
2021, and the baseline value in Jikky's plot is about 48,890 in 2021, so
his plot has about 1.47% excess deaths in 2021. However I don't know if
the baseline in his plot was just drawn by hand, because when I tried
doing a linear regression of the deaths in the years 2015 to 2020, I got
only about 1.06% excess deaths in 2021:</p>

<p>Cancer ASMR has remained roughly flat in Australia between 2020 and
2022, or it has even slightly decreased:
[<a href=https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview>https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-jikkycancer-1.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>Someone on Twitter was wondering why the ASMR plot above showed there
was a decrease in cancer deaths even though Jikky's plot showed there
was an increase in deaths. However it's because Jikky's plot showed a
raw number of deaths which does not account for changes to the age
composition of the population. In the United States there is also a
decreasing trend in cancer ASMR but an increasing trend in the raw
number of cancer deaths:</p>

<p>In Jikky's plot the number of doctor-certified cancer deaths was only
about 1.5% above the baseline in 2021, even though it might have seemed
like a fairly large increase if you didn't pay attention to the y-axis
units, because the years 2015 to 2020 all fell fairly close to the
baseline so the deviation from the baseline in 2021 was fairly large
relative to the average deviation from the baseline during the fitting
period. However in my next plot where I plotted monthly data and I
started the y-axis from zero, the increase in deaths in 2021 seems much
smaller in comparison, even though I got about 1.1% excess deaths in
2021 so it was similar to Jikky's plot that had about 1.5% excess
deaths. However a prepandemic linear trend for raw deaths might also be
too low because the actual trend in raw deaths is curved upwards due to
the aging population, so in the bottom panel below where I plotted ASMR
instead of raw deaths, I got only about 0.2% total excess mortality in
2021:</p>

<p>Another mouse user said that there was 7 sigma excess cancer deaths
in 2022, which was a chance of 1 in trillion:
[<a href=https://x.com/ManDownUnder76/status/1943498826951610846>https://x.com/ManDownUnder76/status/1943498826951610846</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>I pointed out that relative to the 2002-2006 linear trend, there was
also 6 sigma excess deaths in 2008 and 2009. Sigma scores are great if
you are trying to deceive people:

<p>But the baseline was way too low, because it was a simple average of
the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. The report by the ABS said: <span
class="quote">"Using the number of deaths from the previous years as the
predictor for the expected number of deaths does not take into account
changes in population size and age-structures of that population, as
well as expected improvements in mortality rates over time."</span></p>
<p>Jikkyleaks also claimed that there was 5-10% excess cancer mortality
in Australia since 2021, but it's because he cited the ABS report shown
above where the baseline was far too low:
