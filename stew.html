<p>In October 2025 Joe Sansone broke the news that the <span
class="quote">"Alliance of Indigenous Nations International
Tribunal"</span> declared that the COVID-19 vaccines <span
class="quote">"meet the criteria of biological weapons and weapons of
mass destruction"</span>:

<p>Mary Holland (who is supposed to be a lawyer) wrote that AIN's ruling
was the <span class="quote">"the first international ruling of its kind,
effective immediately worldwide"</span>:

<p>Nicolas Hulscher said that AIN's declaration <span

recognized international authority categorizing the COVID-19 mRNA
products as biological weapons"</span>:

<p>Sansone wrote that the Alliance of Indigenous Nations International
Tribunal issued the order <span class="quote">"after reviewing hundreds
of pages of evidence from my current case, including scientific papers
and legal briefs filed in the Florida court system, as well other
scientific papers"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.josephsansone.com/p/exclusive-breaking-news-alliance>https://www.josephsansone.com/p/exclusive-breaking-news-alliance</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration by AIN looks similar to the documents in Sansone's
court case in Florida, because it features expert opinions by Francis
Boyle, Ana Mihalcea, Andrew Zywiec, Paul Alexander, and Rima Laibow, who
all provided testimony to Sansone's case. 3 out of 11 pages of the
declaration were dedicated to the expert opinion of Ana Mihalcea, who
said that vaccines contain quantum dots, nanorobots, microrobots, and
hydrogel.</p>
<p>Andrew Zywiec was called a <span class="quote">"tribal
practicioner"</span> in the declaration, because he claims he is <span
class="quote">"literally a tribal physician with Crow Nation"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/AndrewZywiecMD/status/1976798052456550520>https://x.com/AndrewZywiecMD/status/1976798052456550520</a>]</p>
<p>The declaration had no author listed, but I suspect one of its
authors was Joe Sansone. The declaration was signed by <span
class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span> and by two other people whose
names were not legible:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>You can tell the declaration is the real deal, because it featured
this seal by <span class="quote">"A. Leaping Ram"</span>:</p>

<img src=i/clot-ain-9.webp width=200>
</div>
<p>A Leaping Ram is a sovereign citizenship guru called Glenn Bogue, who
is also known as Spirit Warrior. He gained his Indian status from the
Kinakwii Sovreign Nation, which charges 300 CAD per year for membership:
[<a href=https://www.richardwarman.ca/glenn-bogue-lso-theatre-of-the-absurd/>https://www.richardwarman.ca/glenn-bogue-lso-theatre-of-the-absurd/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With regard to the claim by Glenn Bogue to be <span
class="quote">"non-status Métis"</span> and a member of the <span
class="quote">"Kinakwii Sovereign Nation"</span>, I note that there has
been previous study of the legitimacy or non-legitimacy of the Kinakwii
and that their website indicates that for the low-low price of $300 per
year, anyone can become a member of their <span class="quote">"private,
sovereign, Indigenous nation."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An article about the Alliance of Indigenous Nations said:
[<a href=https://sterry448.substack.com/p/blood-signature-stolen-identity>https://sterry448.substack.com/p/blood-signature-stolen-identity</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AIN Tribunal was allegedly created by those who presented
themselves as sovran legal authorities, including <span
class="quote">'Attorney General'</span> Glenn Bogue and <span
class="quote">'Prosecutor'</span> John Cipolla! It was later learned
that both men were allegedly disbarred from colonial courts, Cipolla in
20221 and Bogue in 2017.[2]</p>
<p>Over the past 6 years, the ASMIN Grand Chief Wabiska (GC) has
undergone recovery from a traumatic brain Injury and major brain
surgery. In 2018, according to GC, Bogue (a court judge) encouraged him
to stay out of the AIN Tribunal and tend to his <span
class="quote">'ASMIN flock'</span>, to leave the general management of
the Tribunal to him, with GC's expectation that he would organize
volunteer participation of community development.</p>
<p>However, unbeknown to GC, Bogue added his signature to multiple court
documents, along with Bogue's own <span class="quote">'bogus'</span>
signature ... <span class="quote">'A Leaping Ram'</span> and <span
class="quote">'Spirit Warrior'</span>. As self-appointed Tribunal
Attorney General (AG), all AIN and ASMIN finances were to be placed in a
<span class="quote">'Trust'</span> account, for future community
development, on completion of a Treaty with the Crowns. According to GC,
all activities were intended to be volunteer participation by the
community's own contributions, as by aboriginal custom.</p>
<p>Bogue, who has no evident indigenous bloodline, without consent, has
allegedly used <span class="quote">"blood"</span> signatures of Clan
Mothers, the Grand Chief, Indigenous Judges who resigned, along with his
self-appointed <span class="quote">'native'</span> names (Spirit Warrior
- Leaping Ram), on mendacious claims and orders in colonial courts.</p>
<p>In the wake, the lives and livelihoods of children, parents and many
others that these <span class="quote">'lawyers'</span> are supposed to
be defending, have been jeopardized, while the member and client <span
class="quote">'fees'</span> are pocketed or stashed in a fraudulent
<span class="quote">'Trust'</span> account of an alleged perpetrator,
with zero accountability.</p>
<p>Bogue claimed he was previously adopted by the Kinakwii Nation, and
has acted in several court cases, allegedly in support of these nations,
on consignment, while allegedly demanding 25% of the <span
class="quote">'winnings'</span> for himself. June 2017, the Law Society
suspended Bogue for <span class="quote">'vexatious conduct'</span>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Cipolla was called the <span class="quote">"prosecutor"</span>
of AIN by one source and the <span class="quote">"leader and
coordinator"</span> of AIN by another source. He took up the Indian name
Zesesaapi Mukwa after he was adopted by this guy, who calls himself the
Grand Chief Wabiska Mukwa:

<p>A Leaping Ram has also written a book called <span
class="quote">"Sacred Sex and the Menopausal Woman"</span>:

<p>In 2024 Alfred Lambremont Webre interviewed Glenn Bogue and John
Cipolla from the Alliance of Indigenous Nations, and two people from
another fake Indian organization called Peoples of the Salmon:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQbfHseV2o>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQbfHseV2o</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-6.webp width=700>
</div>
<p>At time 17:21 Webre said: <span class="quote">"John is the leader and
coordinator of the Alliance of Indigenous Nations that your humble
servant is part of, along with others."</span> So apparently Webre is a
member of AIN.</p>
<p>At time 26:49 Webre talked about his book titled <span
class="quote">"In The Future, Will The United States Of America Break Up
Into Many Regions?"</span>, and he said: <span class="quote">"Spirit
Warrior - Glenn Bogue, the Attorney General of the Alliance of
Indigenous Nations - has contributed a part - uh, extended part - to the
book."</span></p>
<p>At time 30:49, A Leaping Ram said: <span class="quote">"Those who
have studied the history of our solar system would quickly, uh, consede
the fact that the Earth used to be outside of Mars - between Mars and
Jupiter - because of something called Bode's mathematical law."</span>
And he said that at the time the earth <span class="quote">"shone like a
blue jewel, uh, to many many different, uh, you know, ships going by, et
cetera, from other planets, other solar systems."</span> He said the
name for the earth in ancient languages was Gop. And he said that the
earth moved to its current location around 400,000 BC, because one of
the moons of Planet X crashed into the earth. He said that before it the
east coast of Canada and the west coast of Europe used to be part of a
single continent called Pangea, which was populated by the Solutrean
people. (Which I presume is meant to explain why there would be white
indigenous people like himself on the east coast of Canada.)</p>
<p>At time 39:18, A Leaping Ram said: <span class="quote">"This is the
ancient indigenous knowledge that - number one, a female scientist
changed the ovum of an ape into human beings by putting in a sperm from
their Planet X there, and then one of their gods, Enki, the son of man,
had sex with the two daughters of Eve, creating <em>Homo sapiens</em>.
Now, I will hold fast to that, until somebody can come up to me and
disprove the National Geographic DNA study, or the ancient
texts."</span> At time 50:11, he said that the event when the female
scientist from Planet X created humans took place 200,000 years ago, and
that she specifically inserted sperm from Planet X into the egg of a
bonobo. (But then were the Solutreans who lived on Pangea 400,000 years
ago not humans? Or were they part of another earlier creation?)</p>
<p>At time 1:31:07 Webre addressed the panelists and said: <span
class="quote">"What I'd like to do is adivise all of the participants,
who are leaders of Turtle Island indigenous nations - that on behalf of
the tribunal, we'll be inviting each of the four of you - and I'm
putting this - to be attendees at The First International Earth
Conference on Extraterrestrial Genocide, and Successful and Mutually
Advantageous Planetary Rescue, Positive Alliance, and Integration with
Homo Martis Terris. They are the human martian civilization. And it's
all set out there. We're in the process of arranging an international
conference, uh, to ally the positive human civilization with the
positive martian civilization. We have the information that there are
about 1 million, uh, Homo Martis Terris, or human martian civilization
members. They're our genetic cousins. They're a bit more advanced than
earthling humans, and a bit more ethical, living under the surface of
Mars. And that's a conference, and I'll be sending each of you
invitations."</span></p>
<p>The conference was part of Webre's <span class="quote">"Natural and
Common Law Tribunal for Public Health &amp; Justice"</span>. Webre's
source that there are about one million members of the race Homo Martis
Terris was Andrew Basiago, who is supposed to have met one of the
Martians when he traveled back in time to 1970:
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250207012549/https://exopolitics.blogs.com/international_criminal_co/2024/06/first-international-earth-conference-on-extraterrestrial-genocide-.html>https://web.archive.org/web/20250207012549/https://exopolitics.blogs.com/international_criminal_co/2024/06/first-international-earth-conference-on-extraterrestrial-genocide-.html</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-8.webp width=650>

<p>Alfred Lambremont Webre says that the book he wrote with A Leaping
Ram is based on information leaked from a DARPA-CIA time travel program:
[<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Future-United-States-America-Regions-ebook/dp/B0C87CRKTL>https://www.amazon.com/Future-United-States-America-Regions-ebook/dp/B0C87CRKTL</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-ain-7.png width=560>
</div>
<p>Alfred Lambremont Webre coined the term <span
class="quote">"exopolitics"</span>, by which he means <span
class="quote">"the science of relations among intelligent civilizations
in the multiverse"</span>. He claims that he worked as a futurist at the
Stanford Research Institute, and that he was the director of the <span
class="quote">"1977 Jimmy Carter White House Extraterrestrial
Communication Study"</span> at the SRI, but I didn't find evidence that
he actually worked at the SRI, and the 1977 study appears to be his
invention, because almost all references to the study I found came from
Webre. Webre also claims that extraterrestrials coordinated a meeting
between himself and Jimmy Carter on a spaceship in 1977.

<p>Webre was on the board of advisors of the New Energy Movement, which
is a free energy organization founded by the New Age guy Brian O'Leary.

the Secret Space Program conference, who now run Solari Europa and who
do the video and audio production for Catherine Austin Fitts.

<p>The World Bank whistleblower Karen Hudes used to claim that the
global banking system was covertly controlled by a cone-headed race of
hominins called the <em>Homo capensis</em>, but she later renounced the
theory, and she started to say it was disinformation that was fed to her
by Edward Spencer and Alfred Lambremont Weber.

The <em>Homo capensis</em> theory is reminiscent of Weber's theory that
there is a race of Martian humans called Homo Martis Terris.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Indigenous Nations says that their goal is to build a
<span class="quote">"New Earth, a better and Spiritually Enlightened
future!"</span>

It reminded me of Sacha Stone's various ventures, like the New Earth
Project, New Earth Haven, New Earth Trust, New Earth Treaty, New Earth
University, New Earth Exchange, New Earth Retreats, New Earth Nation,
and so on.
[<a href=https://totaldisclosure.net/deep-dive/sacha-stone-ii/>https://totaldisclosure.net/deep-dive/sacha-stone-ii/</a>]
Alfred Lambremont Webre was also part of Sacha Stone's international
court larping operation called the International Tribunal for Natural
Justice. During an ITNJ hearing in April 2020 where Webre played the
role of a judge, he declared that SARS-CoV-2 was not a virus but an
exosome, which meant that all lockdown orders were null and void under
both national and common law.

<p>Peoples of the Salmon and Kinakwii Nation were mentioned in a paper

<p>During another interview with Alfred Lambremont Webre in 2024, A

temples."</span>

<p>At time 35:32, he now also said that when the scientist came from
Planet X to create humans, she carved the face on Mars on her way to the
earth: <span class="quote">"Her name was Ninma. And Ninma came to the
Earth. She was the greatest biologist they had. The men couldn't figure
out how to get this ape thing to become a miner, you know. You know, a
mineral miner in Ethiopia. So they brought Ninma from Planet X, and en
route she carved the face on Mars, as an ancient god. That's a
complicated story. One of their kings died there, and, so, uh. She does
the monument, comes to Ethiopia, creates <em>Homo
sapiens</em>."</span></p>
<p>At time 1:06:42, A Leaping Ram said that the ancient Egyptian texts
state that on the 14th day and 28th day of her moon cycle, the woman
produces a very special monoatomic atom called the Ormus molecule. He
said that creation of the molecule requires two substances, which are
seawater fish and wine, because seawater fish contains precious metals
with a high atomic spin, and because the grapevine was brought to the
earth from Planet X for the purpose of extracting precious metals from
the soil. And he said that <span class="quote">"in a science journal
magazine in 2005, they proved that the high-spin Ormous molecule does
three things: it repairs DNA damage, it raises the intelligence of
stupid there - like Fred Flintstone, you know what I'm talking about -
and, and, it opens the stargate."</span> And he said: <span
class="quote">"So I happened to contact a guy in New York, who was doing
a trampoline display at a health show. He was in, uh, uh, Arizona,
making these trampolines. And I knew that Einstein said, if you could
move the body against gravity, and let it come down safely, you would
put the cells into what's called a dry pack. You would put the female
clitoris which is the cosmic trigger of the skene glands, S-K-E-N-E of
the female that produces massive amounts of ejaculate. Only 10% of women
can ejaculate. Because they haven't been taught. There's not many
courses running around on female ejaculate."</span></p>
