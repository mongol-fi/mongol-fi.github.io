Callender's family runs a WHO-backed vaccine syringe company</a>
</h2>
<p>Todd Callender's family operated a company called Genesis Medical
Technologies, which developed needle-free vaccine syringes, and which
was the first US company with an approved business in Cuba. I found a
Czech translation of an English press release from 1999, which I
translated back to English here:
[<a href=https://www.protext.cz/zpravy/genesis-bezprecedentni-spoluprace-usa-a-kuby/854>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>protext.<wbr>cz/<wbr>zpravy/<wbr>genesis-<wbr>bezprecedentni-<wbr>spoluprace-<wbr>usa-<wbr>a-<wbr>kuby/<wbr>854</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DENVER, July 23 (Reuters) - Genesis Medical Technologies, Inc. (<span
class="quote">"Genesis"</span>) has worked closely with authorities in
Cuba and the United States over the past year to complete the halfway
point of testing its needle-free syringe for commercial sale to the mass
immunization market. Genesis remains the only U.S. company to have a
successful approved business in Cuba. A portion of Genesis' field test
in Cuba was postponed in June due to communication and logistical
issues.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented collaboration between the United States and Cuba,
authorities in both countries worked hard to help Genesis overcome
bureaucratic hurdles and move testing forward. The delays raised
concerns about the vaccine's efficacy after long storage in
polypropylene containers. As a result, Dr. Manuel Diaz of the Cuban
Institute of Tropical Diseases agreed to burn plastic vials filled with
the vaccine in the presence of Dr. Lynn Whitlock of the United States
Interest Section in Havana. The event marked the first <span
class="quote">"end-user"</span> validation of American technology and
created a platform for the two governments to find common ground through
trade.</p>
<p>Todd Callender, general counsel for the Colorado-based company, said
that <span class="quote">"end-user verifications are probably the most
important tool the United States uses to improve trade relations with
former enemies. I witnessed the same process throughout Eastern Europe
in the early 1990s and saw the results of that process in the form of
more liberal export permits and trade. I am impressed by the progress
that Cuba and the United States have made in this regard."</span></p>
<p>Thanks to Cuba's cooperation in this <span
class="quote">"end-user"</span> inspection and the efforts of both
governments to improve trade relations, Genesis received a new export
authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce and was able to ship
replacements to Cuba in less than a month. The field test is currently
scheduled to begin in mid-August and is expected to be completed in
early September. Genesis expects to be attended by representatives from
the United States Interest Section, the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Bahamian Ministry
of Health. WHO is monitoring the field test with the goal of validating
the needle-free syringe and certifying it as an approved device for use
in its global immunization program. Successful completion of this
important test should allow the syringe to be commercially available by
the first quarter of 2000, a good start for treating diseases in the new
millennium.</p>

<p>In the patent for the needle-free injection device sold by Genesis
Medical Devices, the inventors are listed as R. Samson Callender,
William D. Brown, and Jerald C. Umbaugh.

The company was based in Colorado, but Callender was admitted to the
Colorado Bar Association in 1995, and his middle name is Samson.

<p>A book from 1999 said: <span class="quote">"If the Cuban trials are a
success, Genesis Medical attorney Todd Callender said the company's

<p>In 2005 Todd Callender's mother Kathleen and sister Heather
co-founded a company called PharmaJet.

PharmaJet sells two products that are both needle-free syringes intended
for vaccine delivery.
[<a href=https://pharmajet.com/about-us/>https://<wbr>pharmajet.<wbr>com/<wbr>about-<wbr>us/<wbr></a>]
The CEO and Vice President of PharmaJet both previously worked for an
oral vaccine company called Vaxart. The scientific advisory board of
PharmaJet includes people like a former CSO of Pfizer's Vaccine
Immunotherapeutics Research Unit, and Jonathan Nguyen-Van-Tam who was
the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of the UK government.</p>
<p>The first authorized plasmid DNA vaccine for COVID was ZyCoV-D, which
was delivered exclusively using PharmaJet's Tropis product.

In 2021 PharmaJet announced that their needle-free injection system was
used in a polio vaccination campaign in Somalia, which was <span

<p>Todd Callender was a lawyer for AFLDS, and his organization
Vaxxchoice started out as a sister organization of AFLDS. References to
Todd Callender started to appear on Twitter in August 2021, when he
spoke at an event organized by AFLDS.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=%22todd+callender%22+until%3A2021-9-1&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=%<wbr>22todd+<wbr>callender%<wbr>22+<wbr>until%<wbr>3A2021-<wbr>9-<wbr>1&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
Soon after that, Callender filed a lawsuit against the DoD while
representing AFLDS. The two people who provided affidavits to his
lawsuit were Jane Ruby and Theresa Long.</p>
<p>Callender's website had a prominent advertisement for ivermectin
right at the front page, which said: <span class="quote">"IVERMECTIN has
also shown to prevent prion disease from people who have had the Covid
19 experimental shots."</span>

I believe the first person who started to say that the calamari clots
were made of amyloid protein was Ryan Cole, who was named as the Medical
Director of AFLDS in 2021, and who lost his medical license for
prescribing ivermectin while he worked as a telehealth doctor for AFLDS.

<p>In April 2020 Jerome Corsi launched a telehealth website that was
partnered with AFLDS, where he raked in millions of dollars by selling
prescriptions for ivermectin and the Zelenko protocol. A report on the
website said: <span class="quote">"America's Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) -
a leading purveyor of coronavirus misinformation - refers patients to
SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that SpeakWithAnMD.com provides phone
consultations with <span class="quote">'AFLDS-trained physicians'</span>
willing to prescribe hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and other unproven
treatments. According to recent reports, AFLDS referred over 255,000
individuals to SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16, 2021, and September
12, 2021 - approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for initial phone
consultations and many of whom had follow-up consultations for an
additional $60. One investigation also found that some individuals were
charged for consultations that never occurred. In total, individuals
appear to have paid more than $6.7 million for consultations during this

<p>Corsi also set up an online pharmacy called Bonsa Health, which
fulfilled the prescriptions handed out by his AFLDS-trained doctors at a
very steep price. One user on Twitter wrote: <span class="quote">"You
can use speaktoanmd.com for early treatment meds. Telehealth appointment

them to transfer to a local pharmacy and the cost is very reasonable!

<p>In 2004 Corsi told Jewish Daily Forward that <span class="quote">"I

<p>Mel Rockefeller (who claims to be an illegitimate son of Nelson
Rockefeller) traveled to Poland with Corsi in 1995, because Corsi
proposed they would establish a mutual fund in Poland similar to his
B'nai B'rith fund.

<blockquote>
<p>Jerome Corsi is the first person from whom I heard the phrase <span
class="quote">"preparing the mind"</span> when he oversaw a fraud
designed to discredit me in Poland at a time when the Knesset was
predominantly Polish. That fraud was financed by Carl Lindner whose
website then boasted that he was the largest non-Jewish contributor to
Jewish causes in the U.S. I urge that you immediately engage the
documentation provided. My life experience proves the common source of
ongoing geopolitical duplicity, including the narrative-advancing role
played by Corsi.</p>
<p>To portray Corsi as a conspiracy theorist misses the point. He is
either an Israeli agent or a wellpaid asset of the Jewish state. Ask him
about me. Better yet, subpoena me, Munther Ghazal, Ron Burd, my attorney
since 1992, and Jeff Gates, a colleague since 2002. Let us provide
questions to ask Corsi. Note how, while I was in London, I outed him as
a Mossad operative, per the blue-tabbed material. He knows what he did -
and for whom.</p>

<p>Woolsey's pro-Israel, war profiteering profile is typical of those
with whom I interacted - and those operating one degree off those I
profiled while being stalked. That's why the career of U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Rey also merits a closer look.</p>
<p>Former vice-chairman of the $240 million U.S.-funded Polish-American
Enterprise Fund, he then became a principal in Intellibridge, chaired by
David Rothkopf, former managing director of Kissinger Associates. I
learned from hard experience that Kissinger's presence is a sure sign
that those I profiled are nearby. In advertising their security services
on the Intellibridge website, Rey (since deceased) and Rothkopf offer
the on-call assistance of authorities and advisers <span
class="quote">"available to you and your employees anywhere,
anytime."</span></p>
<p>Their Israel-centric <span class="quote">"on-call"</span> advisory
corps includes: Stephen Solarz, former chair of the House Subcommittee
on Asia and the Pacific and a signer of the Project for a New American
Century's 1998 letter to President Clinton urging regime change in Iraq;
Morton Abramowitz, former assistant secretary of state for intelligence
and research, 1985-89; John Deutch, former CIA Director (1995-1996) who
succeeded Woolsey in enabling Russia's loan-for-shares fraud; and Al
From, founding president of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC).[41]
The DLC was led by asset Bill Clinton prior to his 1992 presidential
campaign and then by Senator Joe Lieberman who became the chief promoter
(along with Senator John McCain) of the false intelligence that induced
us to war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former CIA director John Deutch was also an advisory board member
of the Intelligence Summit, which was a conference in DC organized by
Adam Finnegan's mentor John Loftus. The conference was bankrolled by the
Israeli gangster Michael Cherney, who organized a similar conference in
Israel called the Jerusalem Summit.

Cherney's protege Oleg Deripaska was at one point called the richest man
in Russia, and he was a primary Rothschild agent in Russia. Russia's
biggest aluminum company used to be Trans-World Metals, which was
cofounded by Cherney together with his brother and two other Jews. The
money to set up the company was provided by Marc Rich, who was the main
architect of the FIMACO money laundering scheme, where former Communist
Party and KGB assets were transfered to the US secret economy in the
late 80s and early 90s through companies connected to the Jewish mafia,
including Cherney's company Newtel.

<p>FIMACO was a bank registered in the Channel Islands. From 1997 to
2006, Todd Callender's sister was a managing partner of an private
