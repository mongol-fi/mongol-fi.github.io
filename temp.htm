unholy trilogy of preprints by Bruce Rapley and Matt Shelton</a>
</h2>
<p>In January 2026 Bruce Rapley and Matt Shelton uploaded a series of
three preprint about the clots, titled <span
class="quote">"Morphological and Histological Characterisation of
Anomalous Intravascular Casts (AICs)"</span>, <span
class="quote">"Elemental Characterisation of Anomalous Intravascular
Casts Reveals an Abnormal Biochemical Matrix"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"Proteomic Characterisation of Anomalous Intravascular
Casts Reveals Non-Canonical Fibrin Architecture and Impaired
Fibrinolysis"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202601.1846>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>preprints.<wbr>org/<wbr>manuscript/<wbr>202601.<wbr>1846</a>,
<a href=https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202601.2149>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>preprints.<wbr>org/<wbr>manuscript/<wbr>202601.<wbr>2149</a>,

<p>I'm aware of only one earlier scientific paper about the calamari
clots, which was coauthored by Daniel Santiago and John Oller and
published in Oller's journal IJVTPR. Rapley, Shelton, and Santiago were
all credited as members of the <span class="quote">"scientific research
and advisory team"</span> of An Unholy Triad.</p>
<p>The new series of three preprints was basically a rehashing of the
<span class="quote">"top-secret press release"</span> by Solution of
Scientists from September 2024.
[<a href=https://laurakasner.substack.com/p/how-the-white-clots-are-formed>https://<wbr>laurakasner.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>how-<wbr>the-<wbr>white-<wbr>clots-<wbr>are-<wbr>formed</a>]
The authors of the press release were anonymous, even though Laura
Kasner said that Greg Harrison was one of the authors, so I don't know
if Rapley or Shelton were also involved in writing the press
release.</p>
<p>Bruce Rapley's affiliation was listed as <span
class="quote">"Consulting Scientist - Human Health and Environment,
Uranus Consulting, New Zealand"</span>, and his correspondence email was
<code>analyst@<wbr>uranusconsulting.<wbr>org</code>. When I Googled for
<code>"uranus consulting" "rapley"</code>, the only hits were about the
new preprints. Uranus Consulting has a website with no content.

It sounds like a proctological practice, or maybe it refers to the
source the authors consulted to derive their wisdom from.</p>
<p>The methods section of the proteomics paper says: <span
class="quote">"Raw LC–MS/MS data were processed using standard proteomic
analysis pipelines to identify peptides and assign them to corresponding
human proteins under established false discovery rate
thresholds."</span> It's unusual how the authors said they used standard
pipelines but didn't describe the specific utilities they used.</p>
<p>The proteomics paper said <span class="quote">"HPLC–MS/MS analysis
identified a total of 541 human proteins across four
independently"</span>, in the same way that the old press release said
that <span class="quote">"541 proteins, all of human origin, were
discovered"</span>.</p>
<p>However now the SOS guys seem to have finally realized that fibrin is
not supposed to show up in HPLC results, because they no longer said
that a lack of fibrin is somehow anomalous.</p>
<p>The proteomics paper said: <span class="quote">"A complete list of
all 541 identified human proteins, together with their relative
abundances, is provided in Supplementary Table S1."</span> However the
supplementary information was not posted at Preprints.org.</p>
<p>A funding statement said: <span class="quote">"This work received
significant funding from the NZDSOS, and a number of private donors who
wished to remain anonymous, to facilitate the cost of laboratory
analysis."</span></p>
<p>The acknowledgements said: "Technical and analytical support: The
authors thank the international laboratories that assisted with sample
preparation, elemental analysis, and related laboratory procedures.
These laboratories requested anonymity due to the nature of the work,
and their request has been respected. Clinical, mortuary, or sample
access support: The authors acknowledge the embalmers and undertakers
from multiple countries who facilitated access to specimens, clinical
context, and case material, and who cooperated during sample collection.
Their wish to remain anonymous has been respected. Scholarly input and
discussion: The authors thank Professor Robyn Cossford, Dr. Gerry Brady,
Dr. Rob Maunsell and Mr. Nic Broomfield for constructive discussions,
critical feedback, and methodological insights that informed the
development of this work."a</p>
<p>Robyn Cosford was one of the people who were interviewed by Daniel
Broudy on IIRT's Brighteon channel, along with Matt Shelton, Gerry
Brady, David Hughes, Ana Mihalcea, David Nixon, and Shimon Yanowitz.

David Nixon is also a member of NZDSOS.

<p>Rob Maunsell is an NZDSOS member and one of three people who runs an
anthroposophical medical practice called Sophia Healing Centre.

Tom Cowan is also a practicioner of anthroposophical medicine, and
Douglas Gabriel and John Barnwell from American Intelligence Media are
leading anthroposophists. In March 2020 AIM came up with an early theory
that COVID was caused by 5G-activated nanotechnology, which was
frequently promoted by Robert David Steele.
