<p>Added later: McCairn posted these screenshots of a ChatGPT
conversation:

</div>
<p>I replied to him: <span class="quote">"Can you share the full chat?
Those responses seem too good to be true, or like they conform too
closely to what you're saying about the clots. Did you previously tell
ChatGPT about your views? It even addressed you as <span
class="quote">'Dr. McCairn'</span>."</span> And I showed him the
screenshot below, and I said that when I gave the same prompt to ChatGPT
on a fresh account, it didn't say anything about fibrin clots, but it
said that <span class="quote">"The fibrous network resembles that of
electrospun fibers, biodegradable scaffold materials, or collagen
matrices, commonly used in tissue engineering"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-semgpt-5.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>This was McCairn's explanation: <span class="quote">"That's because I
use the LLM properly, constraining it with a domain specialty based off
my previous published works, and that it's role is to act as a colleague
working in the same domain, with a number of academic based plugins,
e.g., Consensus. As you have no published works in a formal scientific
domain, you are not going to be able to use it in the same manner. And
that was pretty much the extent of the exchange."</span> But he didn't
share the full chat. And Greg has also trained his AI to believe in his
mystery ORFs, so does that mean that the mystery ORFs are real?</p>
<p>Then McCairn told me that he wasn't able to share the full chat
because ChatGPT said <span class="quote">"Sharing conversations with
user uploaded images is not yet supported"</span>, which does seem to be
a real limitation of ChatGPT, but which also happened to be convenient
for him.

<p>When I showed the same image to ChatGPT and asked <span
class="quote">"what would cause fibrin to have this shape"</span>,
ChatGPT gave me a list of 7 possible reasons, but they didn't even
include the fibrin being misfolded:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/clot-fibrinshape.webp width=650>
</div>
<p>When I asked McCairn why the strands in his image have a diameter of
about 0.3-3 µm even though strands of fibrin normally have a diameter of
about 0.1 µm, he replied: <span class="quote">"That would be because
they are highly amyloidogenic and diseased as is obvious through the
structural abnormalities, which is supported by the positive signals
with thioflavin, Raman spec, and reactivity under RT-QuIC
protocols."</span>

But I don't know how he can be so sure about it, if he hasn't even
looked at regular fibrin clots under an SEM. I had a hard time even
finding images of what <span class="quote">"amyloidogenic"</span> fibrin
clots are supposed to look like.</p>
<p>When I tried searching for more images of fibrin clots with unusually
thick strands, I found the images below, where image A shows a normal
control, and images B to D show abnormal clots from patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. Image C has some strands that have a diameter of
about 0.3 µm, but it still doesn't look like McCairn's 5000x image:

<p>But I told him that the average fiber diameter in the group treated
with LPS is still about 100 nm. And in all of the images, there's a
higher number of strands visible than in his image, even though the area
shown in the images is about 8 µm wide, but the area in his image is
about 25 µm wide. And I posted this response from ChatGPT, where image 1
refers to McCairn's image and image 2 refers to an image from the study
I linked:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h3>
<p><strong>Image 1 (Cryostat Sliced Sample at 5000X):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 10 µm</li>
<li><strong>Magnification:</strong> 5000X</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The fibrin or fibrous structures
appear <strong>thicker, less organized</strong>, and more sponge-like or
amorphous. There is an absence of the distinct linear fiber morphology
typical of fibrin networks.</li>
<li><strong>Possible interpretation:</strong> This might not be a
classical fibrin network; it could be a cross-linked, dehydrated, or
otherwise altered biological matrix, possibly involving extracellular
matrix or degraded clot components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image 2 (Fibrin with and without LPS, 1 µm
scale):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale bar:</strong> 1 µm</li>
<li><strong>Panels (a), (b), (c):</strong> Clearly show <strong>classic
fibrin fibers</strong> - long, thin, thread-like structures.</li>
<li><strong>Panel (d):</strong> Quantifies fiber diameters: control
fibers have a median around 103-133 nm, while LPS-exposed fibers are
thicker (~165-347 nm), but still distinctly fibrous.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scale-comparison">Scale Comparison</h3>
<ul>
<li>Image 1 has a 10 µm scale bar, while Image 2 has a 1 µm scale
bar.</li>
<li>Even adjusting for this, Image 1 shows <strong>much thicker and less
defined structures</strong>, not matching the characteristic ~100-300 nm
fibrin fibers seen in Image 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>The structures in Image 1 are not consistent with classic
fibrin fibers</strong> as seen in Image 2, either due to differences in
sample preparation (e.g., cryostat slicing), degradation, or they
represent a different biological material altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also told him that his image has a lot of variability in diameter
within different parts of the same strand, and I told him ChatGPT
offered the following as possible explanations for the variability in
diameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="cryostat-slicing-artifacts">1. Cryostat Slicing Artifacts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cryostat sectioning at <strong>5 µm</strong> can compress or shear
soft tissues and networks.</li>
<li>Uneven mechanical forces during slicing can deform fibrin strands,
leading to <strong>local thinning or broadening</strong> along the same
strand.</li>
<li>Ice crystal formation and sublimation during freezing can create
voids or distortions, especially in hydrated networks like fibrin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sem-imaging-of-hydrated-or-non-coated-samples">2. SEM Imaging of
Hydrated or Non-Coated Samples</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the sample was not <strong>properly fixed, dehydrated, and
sputter-coated</strong>, charging effects or dehydration shrinkage can
cause parts of the strand to collapse or appear thicker/thinner.</li>
<li><strong>Beam interaction</strong> in SEM (15 kV in this case) can
exaggerate differences in apparent thickness depending on density and
topography.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biological-heterogeneity-in-fibrin-structure">3. Biological
Heterogeneity in Fibrin Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibrin fibers are <strong>not perfectly uniform</strong>; they can
merge, branch, or bundle. This causes <strong>natural variation in
diameter</strong>, especially in cross-linked or aged clots.</li>
<li>Regions of <strong>dense cross-linking</strong> or association with
other clot components (e.g., platelets, RBC ghosts, ECM proteins) may
appear thicker or more amorphous.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone should try to run SEM on a fresh calamari clot that has just
been extracted for comparison, if such a thing even existed.</p>
<p>McCairn told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don't you in your input for your weak LLM rebuttals the following
additional data.</p>
<p>1. The material has extensive autofluorescence.<br> 2. The tissue
stains positive with thioflavin<br> 3. The sample test positive for
Raman peak at 1720cm<br> 4. The clot causes a positive amyloidogenic
cascade in the RT-QuIC protocol.</p>
<p>Then put the response, here for all to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I posted the response below and wrote: <span class="quote">"Well
it did say your points explain the structure of your image, even though
I don't know if it's a case of the bias where LLMs tend to agree with
the user."</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the listed observations strongly support that the structure in
<strong>Image 1</strong> is <strong>amyloidogenic</strong>, which
explains the atypical, <strong>irregular, matted, and dense
morphology</strong> seen in the SEM image.</p>
<p>Here's how each point aligns:</p>
<h3 id="extensive-autofluorescence">1. Extensive Autofluorescence</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils are known to exhibit autofluorescence due to their
<strong>cross-β-sheet structure</strong> and <strong>dense protein
packing</strong>, which alter their optical properties. This supports
the presence of <strong>protein aggregates</strong> rather than normal
fibrin fibers.</p>
<h3 id="positive-thioflavin-staining">2. Positive Thioflavin
Staining</h3>
<p>Thioflavin (T or S) binds specifically to <strong>β-sheet-rich
amyloid structures</strong>. A positive result confirms that the fibrin
in the clot has undergone a pathological conformational change to form
<strong>amyloid-like aggregates</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="raman-peak-at-1720-cm¹">3. Raman Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹</h3>
<p>A peak near 1720 cm⁻¹ is typically associated with <strong>carbonyl
vibrations (C=O)</strong> and <strong>altered protein secondary
structure</strong>, commonly found in <strong>amyloid fibrils</strong>
or oxidatively modified proteins. This suggests structural changes
consistent with amyloidosis.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rt-quic-amyloid-cascade">4. Positive RT-QuIC Amyloid
Cascade</h3>
<p>RT-QuIC detects the <strong>seeding activity</strong> of misfolded
proteins. A positive result indicates the sample can <strong>propagate
amyloid-like fibril formation</strong>, confirming prion-like behavior,
which is incompatible with normal fibrin function.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These findings indicate that the material in Image 1 is not standard
fibrin but is <strong>misfolded, amyloidogenic fibrin(ogen)</strong>.
This explains the abnormal morphology: <strong>thick, irregular, matted
strands</strong> lacking the well-ordered, thread-like appearance of
healthy fibrin networks (as seen in Image 2). This pathology is often
observed in <strong>chronic inflammation, sepsis, or systemic
amyloidosis-like clotting disorders.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I further asked <span class="quote">"do amyloid properties
explain why image 1 has only a few strands visible, wide strands, and
high variability in diameter within strands"</span>, I got the following
answer from ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="few-visible-strands">1. Few Visible Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloidogenic fibrin tends to <strong>aggregate into dense, fused
masses</strong> rather than forming discrete, well-separated fibers.
Misfolded fibrin(ogen) often loses the ability to form normal polymeric
networks, instead creating <strong>amorphous or sheet-like
clumps</strong>. This results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer discernible individual fibers</li>
<li>More extensive background material or merged structures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wide-strands">2. Wide Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils in blood clots form through <strong>cross-β-sheet
stacking</strong>, which encourages <strong>lateral association</strong>
of protofibrils. This can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the <strong>apparent diameter</strong> of strands</li>
<li>Create <strong>flattened, ribbon-like structures</strong></li>
<li>Produce fibers much thicker than physiological fibrin (~100-300 nm),
consistent with what's seen in Image 1 (often several microns wide)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-variability-in-diameter-within-strands">3. High Variability
in Diameter Within Strands</h3>
<p>Amyloid formation is a <strong>heterogeneous and non-uniform
process</strong>, influenced by local:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeding concentrations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oxidative stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interactions with other biomolecules</strong> (e.g. lipids,
LPS, iron)</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregular lateral growth</li>
<li>Incomplete or uneven fibril merging</li>
<li><strong>Segmental variation in strand width</strong> (i.e., bulges,
tapering, or constricted areas)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Yes - <strong>amyloidogenesis fundamentally alters the structure and
assembly of fibrin</strong>, and this explains the <strong>low fiber
count, wide fused strands, and diameter variability</strong> in Image 1.
These features are consistent with a <strong>pathological, amyloid-rich
clot</strong>, not a normal fibrin network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT appears to have tried to generate answers that supported the
assumption that the structure in McCairn's image was actually made of
misfolded fibrin. LLMs have a tendency to agree with the user even if
the user says something incorrect.</p>
<p>But anyway, in his presentations about the SEM images, McCairn
should've offered a similar explanation for why the anomalous features
might be explained by amyloid properties. I don't recall McCairn having
said anything about the unusual diameter of the strands until I brought
it up on his Discord, let alone having explained why the wide diameter
might be explained by amyloid properties. And he similarly hasn't
brought attention to how his image shows only a small number of
individual strands compared to other SEM images of fibrin clots that
display a comparable area, let alone offer an explanation for why that
would be the case.</p>
<p>And in order to evaluate whether the properties he observed were due
to the preservation or preparation of the sample, McCairn could've also
taken an SEM image of a freshly extracted calamari clot for comparison,
or an image of a regular non-calamari fibrin clot that had been
preserved and prepared the same way as his sample.</p>
<p>As of now, I think McCairn has not established that the structure in
his SEM image is a clot made of fibrin, and he has not established that
the unusual features visible in his image are explained by misfolding of
protein.</p>
