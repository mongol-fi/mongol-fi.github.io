<p>The evidence presented for the existence of turbo cancer is largely
anecdotal, but turbo cancer is nowhere to be found in actual cancer
statistics:

<p>When I searched BitChute for the oldest videos that matched the term
<span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>, many of the oldest results
were videos by German people:
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=%22turbo+cancer%22&sort=old>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>query=%<wbr>22turbo+<wbr>cancer%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>sort=old</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>In the screenshot above, the 4th to 9th oldest results were all
videos of the German cancer pathologist Ute Krüger.</p>
<p>The oldest result above is a video from September 2021, but the title
of the video did not originally include the term <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>, and the title was edited some time
between November 2021 and December 2022.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20210930052406/https://www.bitchute.com/video/IeUcKnactfU1/>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20210930052406/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>IeUcKnactfU1/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>The second-oldest result above is a video from the so-called <span
class="quote">"pathology conference"</span> that was held by Arne
Burkhardt on September 20th 2021 UTC.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/jRX63Ohu0l0g>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>jRX63Ohu0l0g</a>]
The video was posted by KLA.tv, which is operated by a Swiss cult
connected to Scientology called <span class="quote">"Organische
Christus-Generation"</span>.</p>
<p>At first I thought Burkhardt's pathology conference was organized by
Füllmich, because it resembled his press conferences, and it featured
his assistant Viviane Fischer, but actually Füllmich didn't participate
in the conference and he wasn't mentioned anywhere on the website of the
conference.
[<a href=https://pathologie-konferenz.de>https://<wbr>pathologie-<wbr>konferenz.<wbr>de</a>]
But the person who introduced the term <span class="quote">"turbo
cancer"</span> during the conference was the German lawyer Elmar Becker,
who is a member of an organization called Lawyers for Enlightenment,
which was co-founded by Füllmich.</p>
<p>In the video from Burkhardt's conference, someone called Uta Langer
presented a dark field microscopy video, which she said showed the
contents of a BioNTech vaccine vial. At time 12:53, she said there was a
crystalline structure that moved across the screen, even though she said
normally there shouldn't be any moving structures in a vaccine vial
(never mind that the structure she showed looks like cholesterol, which
is a known ingredient of Pfizer vaccines):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-2.jpg width=520>
</div>
<p>Next Uta Langer showed the image below and said in German <span
class="quote">"in a different batch of BioNTech we find this, which
looks like - well, could be a chip"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-3.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>At time 17:45, she showed the following slide and said: <span
class="quote">"This again Johnson &amp; Johnson, with this little
aeroplane-like structure moving. We've seen this plane in many samples,
and it always has this shape, so it's not coincidental it has this
shape. We've seen it quite often."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-4.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>At time 18:28, she showed the slide below and said: <span
class="quote">"This is blood of a vaccinated person. You can see the
money roll phenomenon here [stacking of red blood cells like a roll of
coins]. This is not a hair, it's not contamination, we have taken cloth
material. It looked like graphene layers, it's very very long. And it's
double light shedding. It means that it's a foreign body - maybe the
pathologist should explain - it's non-organic. So it's nothing biologic
that should be inside the body."</span> Then another person asked <span
class="quote">"Could this be Morgellons?"</span> And Langer answered
<span class="quote">"Morgellons - I've seen images shortly after this,
it looked like graphene layers. I can't say whether it's
Morgellons."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-5.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In reality the fibers above have several characteristics of cotton,
because they are about 15 µm wide based on the diameter of the blood
cells, they have a flat cupped or C-like shape, and they have the kind
of lengthwise twists that are called striations in cotton and that are a
distinctive feature of cotton.</p>
<p>Burkhardt's pathology conference was divided into two parts, where in
the first part Burkhardt presented his autopsy findings, and in the
second part other people presented microscope imagery of the contents of
vaccines and vaccinated blood. Videos of both parts with an English
voiceover were posted to Odysee.
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-I-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>SnakeOilPolitics/<wbr>Death-<wbr>by-<wbr>Vaccination-<wbr>Part-<wbr>I-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>press-<wbr>conference-<wbr>from-<wbr>the-<wbr>Institute-<wbr>of-<wbr>Pathology-<wbr>in-<wbr>Reutlingen-<wbr>on-<wbr>the-<wbr>topic</a>,

<p>The second part started out with a presentation by Axel Bolland, who
runs a quack doctoring practice at a spa where he employs techniques
like kirlian photography, homeopathy, bioresonance therapy, and
psychosomatic energetics.
[<a href=https://www.bollants.de/en/natural-medicine/felke-med/concept?item=91ba70e0-1a4f-4184-a18c-658ef29e543d>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bollants.<wbr>de/<wbr>en/<wbr>natural-<wbr>medicine/<wbr>felke-<wbr>med/<wbr>concept?<wbr>item=91ba70e0-<wbr>1a4f-<wbr>4184-<wbr>a18c-<wbr>658ef29e543d</a>]
Ute Krüger also has an alternative medical practice, and she claims she
is able to employ <span class="quote">"energy field technology"</span>
to detect imbalances in the energy field which is the <span
class="quote">"non-material part through which the body and soul
communicate"</span>.
[<a href=https://active-health.se/sv/metod>https://<wbr>active-<wbr>health.<wbr>se/<wbr>sv/<wbr>metod</a>]</p>
<p>At time 8:27, Alex Bolland said this in the English dub: <span
class="quote">"If we look at the content of the vaccines, of course the
spike proteins, mRNA, and graphene oxide - I've seen pictures of that,
of groups, of people from Spain - I don't question this, whatever. I'm
happy to be called - what do we say - what do you call them - conspiracy
theorists, yes. I have also indications that there's mini-robots in the
blood. The earliest time I heard of this was in 95 in a presentation
from someone who was an expert. So I would say the people who are into
this vaccination are 30 years ahead. Thousands of scientists must have
worked on this."</span> A bullet point in his slides suggested that
vaccines contained a parasite called <em>Treponasoma cruzi</em>, even
though he didn't discuss the parasite in his presentation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bolland.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>At time 33:56 in the second-part, someone called Maria-Hubmer Mogg
showed the image below, and she said: <span class="quote">"We don't know
what we're looking at here. If we have people experienced in microscopic
work - they say, sometimes this could look like a parasite, but this is
just the pure vaccine."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-parasite.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>At time 38:25, Maria Hubmer-Mogg said that she saw this structure
which <span class="quote">"looks like a little SIM-card of a cell
phone"</span>, and she asked what it had to do in a so-called
vaccine:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-simcard.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>During her presentation, Uta Langer showed the image below and said
<span class="quote">"This image was six months after the vaccination,
and we see these metal splinters dancing in the blood"</span>:
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics:3/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic:1?t=1232>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>SnakeOilPolitics:<wbr>3/<wbr>Death-<wbr>by-<wbr>Vaccination-<wbr>Part-<wbr>II-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>press-<wbr>conference-<wbr>from-<wbr>the-<wbr>Institute-<wbr>of-<wbr>Pathology-<wbr>in-<wbr>Reutlingen-<wbr>on-<wbr>the-<wbr>topic:<wbr>1?<wbr>t=1232</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-splinters.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Maria Hubmer-Mogg also said that a vaccine sample contained sharp
metallic structures: <span class="quote">"As we're seeing here appear,
this is metallic structures - I think you see my mouse as well - we see
the special specific small color chips without wanting to define what a
chip may be. We have these Y-type structures as well. And here again, as
we've seen before in the observations, metallic structures - we'd have
to decide what that is. And this ring is what we saw here. Also again, a
kind of chip-like structure and a bigger metal type of structure.
Something that is very pointed and sharp."</span>
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?t=1870>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>SnakeOilPolitics/<wbr>Death-<wbr>by-<wbr>Vaccination-<wbr>Part-<wbr>II-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>press-<wbr>conference-<wbr>from-<wbr>the-<wbr>Institute-<wbr>of-<wbr>Pathology-<wbr>in-<wbr>Reutlingen-<wbr>on-<wbr>the-<wbr>topic?<wbr>t=1870</a>]</p>
<p>Burkhardt similarly claimed that the tissue samples he analyzed
contained metallic structures, but in reality his metallic structures
may have been cholesterol:

<p>The anti-vaxxer DrJohnB2 posted these comments about Burkhardt's

<blockquote>
<p>It was a pity that no results of histological examinations with
immunofluorescence were made or shown. Such things can be done easily
and quickly with today's technology.</p>
<p>It was also a pity that the microscopic analyses of the vaccines were
done in an amateurish way:</p>
<p>- No scale bar available in any image (always very annoying.
Complicates the interpretation)<br> - No quantitative analysis of the
particle characteristics, no statistical analysis<br> - No 3D volume
rendering of 3D microscopic image stacks (that would be very helpful to
characterize the foreign bodies)<br> - No fluorescence microscopy<br> -
No mass spectroscopy<br> - No electron microscopy<br> - No
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (analysis of
elemental composition)<br> - No quantitative analysis, no statistical
analysis</p>

</h2>
<p>During Burkhardt's pathology conference in September 2021, a German
lawyer called Elmar Becker conveyed the following anecdote about breast
cancer from an anonymous female doctor, who was later revealed to be Ute
Krüger:
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?start=107>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>SnakeOilPolitics/<wbr>Death-<wbr>by-<wbr>Vaccination-<wbr>Part-<wbr>II-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>press-<wbr>conference-<wbr>from-<wbr>the-<wbr>Institute-<wbr>of-<wbr>Pathology-<wbr>in-<wbr>Reutlingen-<wbr>on-<wbr>the-<wbr>topic?<wbr>start=107</a>,
transcript of English dub]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She gave me an example which I'd like to share here anonymously.
<span class="quote">"The lady - 70 years old - had breast cancer, and
this breast cancer was well under control, and it didn't grow
anymore"</span> - I have to note here that with elderly people cancer
does not grow as quick, as fast as with younger people - now the lady
was vaccinated, and the colleague told me, <span class="quote">"After
six weeks this tumor - this breast cancer - started to grow again. In
the end it had to be - undergo surgery after six months because it had
exploded. It had a starting size of 1-1-1 in the three dimensions. After
about three months it was 14-14. And when it was removed after six
months - so you see how telescoped things are here - it was
16-16-16."</span> So with me that raised the question: can it be that
this is in the context of the vaccination, and could it be that in the
question discussed in the literature or now by immune suppression plays
a role? I would like to look at this question with Dr. Bolland, and
maybe you could explain to us what you have found in blood examinations,
and how you could explain certain possible context and correlations -
when correlated to what I would call turbo cancer - of course medically
not quite correct - but impressive and clear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe Beckar's presentation contained the first ever public use
of the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> in its present
vaccine-related meaning (or <span class="quote">"turbokrebs"</span> in
the original German video).</p>
<p>At time 59:54 in the same video, Elmar Becker said: <span
class="quote">"We are moving into this project now to look at this
phenomenon of the turbo cancer, which is not proven yet, but where we
have to move into an observation study, now, scientifically. I've been
coached by a university who will accompany this, we have a research
design, and we're carrying on."</span></p>
<p>An article about turbo cancer in a German wiki said that <span
class="quote">"the author of the term is a lawyer named Elmar Becker
(member of
<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Anw%C3%A4lte_f%C3%BCr_Aufkl%C3%A4rung>Lawyers

<p>The organization Anwälte für Aufklärung (<span class="quote">"Lawyers

Intelligence"</span> or <span class="quote">"Lawyers for
Clarification"</span>) was co-founded by the German lawyers Gordon
Pankalla and Reiner Füllmich.</p>
<p>In 2021 Lawyers for Enlightenment organized a <span

from Kla.TV:

<p>Some of the images of vaccinated blood that were presented in
Burkhardt's conference came from a German naturopath called Bärbel
Ghitalla. The images had earlier been featured in a video released in
August 2021, where her lab was visited by Elmar Becker and two other

<a href=#Burkhardts_autopsy_findings id=Burkhardts_autopsy_findings>Burkhardt's
autopsy findings</a>
</h2>
<p>An article about Burkhardt's pathology conference said the following
in German:
[<a href=https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/2021/09/25/mitglieder-der-pathologiekonferenz-verbreiten-unbelegte-behauptungen-ueber-covid-19-impfungen-und-todesfaelle/>https://<wbr>correctiv.<wbr>org/<wbr>faktencheck/<wbr>2021/<wbr>09/<wbr>25/<wbr>mitglieder-<wbr>der-<wbr>pathologiekonferenz-<wbr>verbreiten-<wbr>unbelegte-<wbr>behauptungen-<wbr>ueber-<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>impfungen-<wbr>und-<wbr>todesfaelle/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is suspected that neither Burkhardt nor Lang performed
autopsies on these people themselves, but had samples and organs sent to
them from Germany and Austria. In his lecture, Burkhardt explains (in
the video 18:19 to 18:38): <span class="quote">"The Austrians were the
ones who provided the best specimens and information."</span> One of his
main activities was to compile the data: <span class="quote">"Because at
some point the organs were lying in my possession and I didn't even know
what they were for."</span></p>
<p>Where the samples and organs come from remains unclear, as do the
examination methods used.</p>
<p>The team from the German Autopsy Register for Covid-19 Infections
complained to CORRECTIV.Faktencheck that the criteria for selecting the
cases were <span class="quote">"unclear"</span>. The entire <span
class="quote">"method of evaluation"</span> was not comprehensible, and
there was a lack of information on previous illnesses and other relevant
clinical data.</p>
<p>Professional associations describe the results of the <span
class="quote">"Pathology Conference"</span> as <span
class="quote">"scientifically unfounded"</span>. The result of their
investigations, says Burkhardt in the video, is that in five out of ten
of the deaths examined, a connection with a vaccination against Covid-19
is <span class="quote">"very likely"</span> and in two cases <span
class="quote">"probable"</span>.</p>
<p>The autopsy registry team is also critical of this classification. No
reasons were given as to which cases were assigned to which category and
why. No <span class="quote">"decision criteria"</span> were given for
these assignments, and <span class="quote">"a causal chain of the cause
of death"</span> was not established. There is therefore no evidence
that a vaccination against Covid-19 really led to death in the cases
examined.</p>
<p>We also asked two associations of pathologists for an assessment of
the results. The Federal Association of German Pathologists (BDP) wrote
to us: <span class="quote">"To our knowledge, the opinions expressed in
the video by Professor Burkhardt and Professor Lang are currently
neither sufficiently scientifically substantiated nor are they available
in a format worthy of comment."</span> Before they are made public,
according to the BDP, the results should be presented and discussed in
specialist circles on the basis of sufficient data.</p>
<p>The German Society for Pathology (DGP) also writes to us that <span
class="quote">"the data presented"</span> in the video are <span
class="quote">"not scientifically based"</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the website of Burkhardt's conference, I didn't see any scientific
publication about the findings presented in the conference, but only
videos, Powerpoint slides, and a press release.
[<a href=https://pathologie-konferenz.de/Tod_nach_COVID-19-Impfung_www_pathologie-konferenz_de.pdf>https://<wbr>pathologie-<wbr>konferenz.<wbr>de/<wbr>Tod_<wbr>nach_<wbr>COVID-<wbr>19-<wbr>Impfung_<wbr>www_<wbr>pathologie-<wbr>konferenz_<wbr>de.<wbr>pdf</a>]
In fact I didn't find any scientific paper published by Burkhardt since
2012.
[<a href=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&q=arne+burkhardt>https://<wbr>scholar.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>scholar?<wbr>as_<wbr>vis=1&amp;<wbr>q=arne+<wbr>burkhardt</a>,

<p>The closest thing to a scientific paper Burkhardt published about his
autopsy findings might have been a short 4-page article that he
coauthored with Sucharit Bhakdi, which accompanied a video presentation
that Burkhardt did for Bhakdi's organization Doctors for COVID Ethics.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-covax.pdf>https://<wbr>doctors4covidethics.<wbr>org/<wbr>wp-<wbr>content/<wbr>uploads/<wbr>2021/<wbr>12/<wbr>end-<wbr>covax.<wbr>pdf</a>]
But the article was not very detailed and not structured like a
scientific paper.</p>
<p>The article by Bhakdi and Burkhardt featured the table below, which
listed 15 cases of people who are suspected to have died due to
vaccination, but one of the people is supposed to have been 95 years old
and died 68 days after vaccination, and another person is supposed to
have been 89 years old and died 6 months after vaccination:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-burkhardttable.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>Bhakdi and Burkhardt wrote: <span class="quote">"Because vaccination
was the single common denominator between all cases, there can be no
doubt that it was the trigger of self-destruction in these deceased
individuals."</span> But if a 89-year died about 6 months after
vaccination, then how can Bhakdi and Burkhardt know that the death was
triggered by vaccination? They didn't provide a detailed description of
any of the cases or any case-by-case reasoning of why they attributed
each death to vaccination. And Bhakdi and Burkhardt wrote that they
selected the 15 cases they analyzed because they were all cases of
people who had died after vaccination, so it's not very surprising that
vaccination would've been a <span class="quote">"common denominator
between all cases"</span>, so the existence of the common denominator is
hardly reason to conclude that the people died because of the
vaccination.</p>
<p>Bhakdi and Burkhardt also wrote: <span class="quote">"Not a single
death was brought into any possible association with the vaccination by
the coroner or the public prosecutor; this association was only
established by our autopsy findings."</span> So Burkhardt's attribution
of vaccines as the cause of death was not necessarily supported by other
lines of evidence. However it's not clear if the autopsies were
originally peformed for the purpose of determining whether the deaths
were caused by vaccination, or if the coroners even looked for evidence
that the deaths were caused by vaccination.</p>
<p>An article by Die Welt said:

<blockquote>
<p>Professor Benjamin Ondruschka, Director of the Institute of Forensic
Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, watched the
lecture. He watched the press conference with two experienced colleagues
- but had trouble following. <span class="quote">"It wasn't clear to me
exactly what the two of them were talking about until the end,"</span>
he says. <span class="quote">"They didn't say where they got these
samples or preparations from, whether they were slides that had been
presented to them by other pathologists or forensic doctors for a second
opinion, whether they were particularly difficult cases, whether the
patients had shown symptoms during their lifetime. But that is really
important for the assessment. The cases seemed to be very heterogeneous,
in some cases with time intervals of several months between vaccination
and death."</span></p>
<p>The tissue images presented during the press conference also do not
convince Ondruschka that there is a vaccination scandal. <span
class="quote">"In one image, for example, we saw isolated inflammatory
cells in the heart muscle,"</span> he says. <span class="quote">"But
such a small finding doesn't kill you. Such individual cells are always
found in tissue sections. Even if you were to take a blood sample from
me now, it would contain white blood cells (lymphocytes). They belong in
the blood."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary reason why Burkhardt attributed the deaths to vaccination
seems to have been that the tissues he examined had a high concentration
of t-lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cells, but apparently
some of his images didn't even display a very high level of white blood
cells.</p>

<p>When I searched Odysee for the term <span class="quote">"turbo

<p>Ute Krüger lives in Sweden, so she is sometimes called Swedish, but
she speaks Swedish with a heavy German accent. She was not a speaker in
Burkhardt's first pathology conference where the concept of <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> appears to have been first
introduced to the world, but she was a speaker at Burkhardt's second
pathology conference in December 2021.
[<a href=https://pathologie-konferenz.de/PM%202.%20Pathologie-Konferenz%20final-online.pdf>https://<wbr>pathologie-<wbr>konferenz.<wbr>de/<wbr>PM%<wbr>202.%<wbr>20Pathologie-<wbr>Konferenz%<wbr>20final-<wbr>online.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<p>Ute Krüger's website says in Swedish: <span class="quote">"Between
2015-2023, I worked as a senior physician in Clinical Pathology at
Kalmar County Hospital while also being a senior physician at the
Institute of Clinical Sciences at Lund University."</span>
[<a href=https://active-health.se/sv/om>https://<wbr>active-<wbr>health.<wbr>se/<wbr>sv/<wbr>om</a>]
But next it says: <span class="quote">"In recent years I have taken
several courses on diet and lifestyle, herbal medicine, orthomolecular
medicine, parasites, live blood analysis, energy medicine, Ayurveda and
Reiki."</span> Her website also says in Swedish: <span class="quote">"I
work with information field technology. The information field is seen as
the non-material part through which the body and soul communicate. With
this technology, I can detect imbalances in the information field that
can affect people in all life situations."</span>
[<a href=https://active-health.se/sv/metod>https://<wbr>active-<wbr>health.<wbr>se/<wbr>sv/<wbr>metod</a>]
It's probably safe to bet that she is lying when she claims that she has
access to technology that enables her to analyze the <span
class="quote">"information field"</span> which is <span
class="quote">"the non-material part through which the body and soul
communicate"</span>.</p>
<p>The Swedish word for <span class="quote">"information field
technology"</span> on her website was <span
class="quote">"informationsfältsteknologin"</span>. When I searched for
the Swedish term on Google, her website was the only hit. But the term
might refer to something called <span class="quote">"TimeWaver
technology"</span>:
[<a href=https://timewaver.com/international/en/the-information-field/>https://<wbr>timewaver.<wbr>com/<wbr>international/<wbr>en/<wbr>the-<wbr>information-<wbr>field/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The so-called Information Field is originally part of a unified field
theory, formulated by German physicist Burkhard Heim (a student of
Werner Heisenberg) in the late 1970s. Heim had thereby pursued a task at
which many renowned physicists, for example Albert Einstein or Stephen
Hawking, had so far ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Burkhard Heim's field theory is based on a world view comprising 12
dimensions. In Burkhard Heim's model, the Information Field is localized
in the 7th and 8th dimensions. Its meaning goes far beyond physics: It
is the level of our existence where all answers to all questions are
stored, our predetermination and all knowledge.</p>
<p>TimeWaver technology is based on the theory that the essence and
function of the Information Field can be purposefully applied by those
who are familiar with it. It is about retrieving all the information
about a person's mind and body that is stored in the Information Field
of the Earth and the Universe; the positive as well as the negative, the
strengths as well as the weaknesses, the normalities as well as the
abnormalities.</p>

<p>When I searched for the earliest tweets that matched the term <span

term was used in the present vaccine-related meaning referred to
Burkhardt's conference. The oldest tweet was posted a few hours after
the conference by Bobby Rajesh Malhotra, who has done a lot of research
exposing Füllmich as controlled opposition, and who suggested that
Burkhardt's conference was an attempt for plants in the conspiracy

He cited Ryan Cole as a source that there had been an increase in
cancer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Idaho, Dr. Ryan Cole, a diagnostics lab owner, is already
reporting a 2000% increase in cancers among those who took the vaccines.
<span class="quote">"Since January 1, in the laboratory, I'm seeing a
20-times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual
basis,"</span> Cole stated in the video. <span class="quote">"I'm not

<p>In children, post-vaccine cancers will take longer to develop, so
they may evade cancer death for many years. But in adults who are
already growing micro tumors - and nearly everyone is already doing that
- the loss of immune function will result in the rapid acceleration and
spread of cancer, overwhelming their bodies in a matter of a few months
to a few years, depending on their health status when the vaccines were
first injected.</p>

<p>Several early tweets about turbo cancer referred to Ryan Cole, who is
a pathologist just like Arne Burkhardt, Walter Lang, and Ute Krüger:

<p>Accounts that promote Miles Guo also tweeted many videos by Cole:</p>

<p>In July 2021 Cole started to say that he had seen a 10- to 20-fold
increase in uterine cancer. About two weeks earlier he falsely diagnosed
a woman as having endometrial cancer, who decided to have her uterus
removed, but she sued Ryan Cole after it turned out she didn't have
cancer after all:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="quote">"I have seen a 10- to 20-fold increase of uterine
cancer in the last six months in my laboratory,"</span> Cole
<a href=https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/videos/post/summit-sessions-the-science-ryan-cole-md-covid-19-vaccines-autopsy>said
at a meeting of America's Frontline Doctors</a> in San Antonio, Texas,
about two weeks after he misdiagnosed J.B. with cancer of the uterine
lining. <span class="quote">"In the last six months. When did we start
shots? January? How much solid-tumor cancer increase are we going to see
over the next several years? Probably a lot."</span></p>
<p>Cole became medical director of America's Frontline Doctors - an
organization that opposes COVID-19 vaccines - in July 2021, the month he
gave that presentation, according to his resume. Cole has yet to
publicly share data to back up his claim.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>She chose surgery and, on July 26, 2021, the doctor performed surgery
to remove her uterus, remove both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes,
and tissue and lymph nodes in her abdomen, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>Three pathologists at the hospital examined the organs and tissue as
they were removed and saw no cancer. The surgeon asked to get the biopsy
tissue samples back from Cole's laboratory; in early August, three of
the hospital's pathologists determined that biopsy, too, showed no sign
of cancer, the lawsuit says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a video published on August 11th 2021 UTC where Ryan
Cole said: <span class="quote">"Since January 1, in the laboratory, I've
seen a 20 times increase of endometrial cancer, over what I see on an
annual basis."</span>
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813042516/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUE5EBPt-lU>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20210813042516/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=tUE5EBPt-<wbr>lU</a>]</p>
<p>On September 24th 2021 UTC which was only 4 days after Burkhardt's
pathology conference, Del Bigtree published an interview with Ryan Cole
where Cole said vaccines cause accelerated cancer and he said: <span
class="quote">"I'll have a call later with three German pathologists.
They're seeing similar signals. They're gonna be working on it as well.
But it's based -. Another colleague in Dallas is gonna be working on it.
We're trying to get a consortium of doctors together to study
this."</span>
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vrnol2-dr&#x2e;-ryan-cole-is-there-a-covid-vaccine-cancer-connection.html?start=917>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>vrnol2-<wbr>dr.-<wbr>ryan-<wbr>cole-<wbr>is-<wbr>there-<wbr>a-<wbr>covid-<wbr>vaccine-<wbr>cancer-<wbr>connection.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=917</a>]
The three German pathologists probably referred to Arne Burkhardt,
Walter Lang, and Ute Krüger. In 2023 Arne Burkhardt was asked if there
were other pathologists who had been able to confirm his findings, but
the only pathologist he named was Ryan Cole.
[<a href=https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>t<wbr>h<wbr>e<wbr>l<wbr>a<wbr>s<wbr>t<wbr>a<wbr>m<wbr>e<wbr>r<wbr>i<wbr>c<wbr>a<wbr>n<wbr>v<wbr>a<wbr>g<wbr>a<wbr>b<wbr>o<wbr>n<wbr>d<wbr>.<wbr>com/<wbr>arne-<wbr>burkhardt-<wbr>interview-<wbr>12-<wbr>23-<wbr>23/<wbr></a>,
1:51:54]</p>
<p>When Ryan Cole said he had a colleague in Dallas, he probably
referred to the oncologist Ray Page. When I searched Twitter for the
term <span class="quote">"turbokrebs"</span>, one of the earliest tweets
I found was a video of Ray Page from a conference in Texas. The bottom
of the video said <span class="quote">"NTD.COM"</span> which refers to
Falun Gong's media outlet New Tang Dynasty:
[<a href=https://x.com/DieechteBecky/status/1464354134010830857>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>DieechteBecky/<wbr>status/<wbr>1464354134010830857</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-ntd.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>The conference in Texas was livestreamed by Epoch Times and NTD.
Other speakers in the conference included Peter McCullough, Ryan Cole,
and Bryan Ardis. The presentation by Ray Page was actually fairly
reasonable, and he didn't make the kind of wild claims like Ryan Cole
who was saying there was a 10-to-20-fold increase in certain types of
cancer. Ray Page referred to Ryan Cole as saying that vaccines may have
caused or accelerated cancer, but Page said he had not yet seen an
increase in cancer himself: <span class="quote">"So the question of
whether this can cause cancer or not: Dr. Cole as a pathologist has seen
a lot of signals in his practice looking at the pathologic features. We
know that viruses can cause cancer, you know the Epstein-Barr, herpes
virus HIV, human papilloma virus, and we even have some vaccines that
can potentially mitigate some of that. But there's potential laboratory
signals that are suggesting that there's interactions with these spike
proteins with certain cancer genes, which has the possibility to cause
or accelerate cancer. Now I haven't seen that clinically yet and I
haven't seen a lot of clinical data with that yet, but I think we need
to really keep our eyes open."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzEuYRKdJY&t=1h26m39s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=5gzEuYRKdJY&amp;<wbr>t=1h26m39s</a>]</p>
<p>A German article published two weeks after Burkhardt's conference
said that said there were <span class="quote">"numerous reports of
explosive cancer after covid-19 vaccination"</span>. The article said
that the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was coined at
the pathology conference:
[<a href=https://report24.news/zahlreiche-berichte-von-explosivem-krebsgeschehen-nach-covid-19-impfung/>https://<wbr>report24.<wbr>news/<wbr>zahlreiche-<wbr>berichte-<wbr>von-<wbr>explosivem-<wbr>krebsgeschehen-<wbr>nach-<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>impfung/<wbr></a>,
translated]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-coined.webp width=530>
</div>
<p>The article cited Ryan Cole as a source that COVID vaccines had
caused an increase in cancer and that cancers were now more aggressive
than earlier:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-germancole.webp width=530>
</div>
<p>So it's interesting that two weeks after the term <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was coined by Germans, a German
article about turbo cancer was already quoting Ryan Cole as an expert on
turbo cancer.</p>
<p>In July 2021 Ryan Cole became the <span class="quote">"Medical
Director"</span> of America's Frontline Doctors, which was run by the
Jew Simone Gold. She previously worked as the assistant of Michael Oren,
who was the Israeli ambassador to the United States, and who was named
by the Jerusalem Post as one of the ten most influential Jews in the
world.
[<a href=https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads>https://<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>i<wbr>n<wbr>e<wbr>t<wbr>t<wbr>e<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>n<wbr>u<wbr>m<wbr>s<wbr>f<wbr>o<wbr>g<wbr>h<wbr>o<wbr>r<wbr>n<wbr>e<wbr>x<wbr>p<wbr>r<wbr>e<wbr>s<wbr>s<wbr>.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>americas-<wbr>frontline-<wbr>doctors-<wbr>all-<wbr>roads</a>]
The news team of America's Frontline Doctors was run out of Israel by
the Kahanist Chabadnik Mordechai Sones. Sones also hosted the podcast of
AFLDS which is now inactive, but during the last episode of the podcast
he read out a letter by the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
[<a href=https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah>https://<wbr>soundcloud.<wbr>com/<wbr>aflds/<wbr>letter-<wbr>on-<wbr>science-<wbr>and-<wbr>torah</a>]
In the 80s Mordechai Sones worked on <span class="quote">"research in
areas of how to upgade CIA covert arms pipeline to Afghans"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-sones-bab8b916/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>linkedin.<wbr>com/<wbr>in/<wbr>mordechai-<wbr>sones-<wbr>bab8b916/<wbr></a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-cole-sones.jpg width=520>
</div>
<p>Ryan Cole's medical license was revoked in 2021 because he worked as
a telehealth doctor on a website affiliated with AFLDS, because he
offered prescriptions for ivermectin through a text-only chat where he
<span class="quote">"prescribed medications that are not indicated for a
COVID-19 infection, failed to properly document adequate justification
for the treatment in the medical record, failed to take a history or
perform a physical examination, and failed to obtain appropriate
informed consent"</span>.
[<a href=https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf>https://<wbr>lymescience.<wbr>org/<wbr>rogues/<wbr>Ryan-<wbr>Cole/<wbr>Ryan-<wbr>Neil-<wbr>Cole-<wbr>charges-<wbr>and-<wbr>findings-<wbr>of-<wbr>unprofessional-<wbr>conduct-<wbr>WA-<wbr>2024.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<p>AFLDS was also affiliated with another similar telehealth website
called SpeakWithAnMD.com, which was launched by Jerome Corsi in April
2020. Jerome Corsi managed two mutual funds for the Jewish freemasonic
organization B'nai B'rith, and in 2004 he told The Forward that <span
class="quote">"I've been a strong supporter of B'nai B'rith and Jewish
causes for 30 years"</span>.
[<a href=https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/>https://<wbr>forward.<wbr>com/<wbr>news/<wbr>5291/<wbr>campaign-<wbr>confidential-<wbr>58/<wbr></a>]
A report about Corsi's website said: <span class="quote">"America's
Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) - a leading purveyor of coronavirus
misinformation - refers patients to SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that
SpeakWithAnMD.com provides phone consultations with <span
class="quote">'AFLDS-trained physicians'</span> willing to prescribe
hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and other unproven treatments. According
to recent reports, AFLDS referred over 255,000 individuals to
SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16, 2021, and September 12, 2021 -
approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for initial phone consultations
and many of whom had follow-up consultations for an additional
$60."</span>
[<a href=https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/2021.10.29%20Lettrer%20to%20SpeakWithAnMD%20re%20Misinformation.pdf>https://<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>democrats-<wbr>oversight.<wbr>house.<wbr>gov/<wbr>sites/<wbr>evo-<wbr>subsites/<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>democrats-<wbr>oversight.<wbr>house.<wbr>gov/<wbr>files/<wbr>2021.<wbr>10.<wbr>29%<wbr>20Lettrer%<wbr>20to%<wbr>20SpeakWithAnMD%<wbr>20re%<wbr>20Misinformation.<wbr>pdf</a>]
So that's over 6 million USD in the initial consulting fees over less
than two months through a single referrer alone.</p>
<p>The three products that were initially promoted on Corsi's website
were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc, which are the three
components of the Chabadnik Vladimir Zelenko's protocol.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-5-1%20speakwithanmd.com&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=until%<wbr>3A2020-<wbr>5-<wbr>1%<wbr>20speakwithanmd.<wbr>com&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
Corsi's website offered prescriptions for HCQ and azithromycin, but his
website had a partnership with an online pharmacy called Bonsa Health,
which appears to have been set up for the purpose of selling the drugs
prescribed by Corsi's website.

Ivermectin typically costs about 1 USD per 3 mg tablet, and a
recommended dose for treating river blindness or threadworms consists of
a single dose of 4-5 tablets for a body weight of 150 pounds.

<p>Before Richard Hirschman did his alt media debut on Jane Ruby's show
in January 2022, I have found zero references to the novel type of white
fibrous clots that are supposedly found by embalmers like Hirschman. In
March 2022, I believe Ryan Cole became the first person who was not a
mortician but who claimed to have seen the clots. He was also one of the
few people featured in Died Suddenly who were not morticians, and I
believe he was the second person after Mike Adams who presented a
laboratory analysis of the clots. [<a href=clot.html>clot.<wbr>html</a>]
Hirschman was supposedly discovered by chance by the DMED whistleblower
Theresa Long, who happened to visit a funeral home where he did
embalming and connected him with Jane Ruby. Todd Callender is a lawyer
who worked for AFLDS, and who worked with Theresa Long and other DMED
whistleblowers. His organization Vaxxchoice started out as an offshoot
of AFLDS. In 2021 when Todd Callender sued the DoD on behalf of AFLDS,
the two people who provided affidavits to his case were Theresa Long and
Jane Ruby. Long said that vaccines contained antifreeze, and Ruby said
that vaccines contained graphene oxide and lethal parasites.
[<a href=https://drjaneruby.com/dr-jane-ruby-affidavit/>https://<wbr>drjaneruby.<wbr>com/<wbr>dr-<wbr>jane-<wbr>ruby-<wbr>affidavit/<wbr></a>]
Todd Callender later said that the clots are 5G antennas that contain
hydras. [<a href=clot.html#Todd_Callender>clot.<wbr>html#<wbr>Todd_<wbr>Callender</a>]
He has also said that dental anesthetic contains DARPA hydrogel. So it's
interesting that the lawyer of the person who is supposed to have
discovered Hirschman worked for the same organization as the first
non-mortician who supposedly saw the clots.</p>

<p>Stricker was possibly the main person responsible for popularizing
the Morgellons disease hoax, and he coauthored at least 13 papers about
Morgellons disease before COVID.

<p>The term <span class="quote">"Morgellons disease"</span> was coined
in 2002 by Mary Leitao, who found fibers embedded in skin lesions of her
son. She named the disease after a medical condition described in the
1600s where children grew hairs on their back.
[<a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/letter/letter.html>http://<wbr>penelope.<wbr>uchicago.<wbr>edu/<wbr>letter/<wbr>letter.<wbr>html</a>]
Raphael Stricker was on the advisory board of Savely's Morgellons
Research Foundation.

The earliest paper about Morgellons disease that is structured like a
scholarly paper is probably a paper published in 2006 that was
coauthored by Virginia Savely, Mary Leitao, and Raphael Stricker.

<p>In 2019 the California Medical Board issued a complaint against

<p>Stricker was kicked out of academia in 1990 because he falsified data
in an AIDS study, and afterwards he worked as an associate director of a
penis enlargement clinic.

A notice by the NIH's Office of Research Integrity said: <span
class="quote">"An investigation conducted by the University found that
Dr. Stricker falsified data for a manuscript and a PHS-supported
publication reporting research on AIDS. In the manuscript, Dr. Stricker
selectively suppressed data that did not support his hypothesis, and
reported consistently positive data whereas only one of four experiments
had produced positive results. In the publication, Dr. Stricker reported
that an antibody was found in 29 of 30 homosexuals, but not found in
non-homosexuals. However, Dr. Stricker's control data, which he
suppressed, showed the antibody in 33 of 65 non-homosexuals. The
falsified data was used as the basis for a grant application to the
National Institutes of Health."</span>

<p>A case study published in 2011 described the case of a man who had
earlier thought he was poisoned by the Japanese mafia, but then he
learned about Morgellons disease from the internet, so he bought
ivermectin in bulk from an online veterinary supplier, and he ended up
developing ivermectin toxicity:

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. A, a 46-year-old Caucasian man, presented to the emergency room
complaining of infestation with parasites, evidenced by cutaneous
sensations of crawling and itching, and seeing <span
class="quote">"cocoons"</span> buried in his skin. These symptoms began
2 years earlier along with delusions of being poisoned by the Japanese
Mafia. Evaluation by a primary care physician revealed no signs of
infection. He was referred to psychiatry, but never followed-up. He
instead gathered information from the internet, diagnosed himself with
MD, and paid for telephonic consultation with a MD <span
class="quote">"expert"</span> who prescribed the patient antibiotics and
later recommended ivermectin, which he purchased in bulk from an on-line
veterinary supplier. Mr. A ingested ivermectin daily in unknown but
escalating quantities as cutaneous sensations waxed and waned.</p>
<p>On exam, he displayed slow speech with prolonged latency, an
intention tremor, and ataxia. He was disorganized and sometimes
incoherent, but denied prior medical or psychiatric history, though
urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabinoids. Skin
examination was unremarkable. He was admitted with a diagnosis of
delirium secondary to ivermectin toxicity that resolved over the course
of 2 days with supportive therapy. Due to persistent paranoia and
delusions of infestation, olanzapine 10 mg/d was started. Although
reluctant to forego ivermectin and take antipsychotic medication, Mr. A
consented, and after 1 week reported reduced skin sensations and
delusional conviction. He was discharged after 10 days with a diagnosis
of delusional disorder.</p>
<p>This case adds to an existing literature on the self-diagnosis of MD
facilitated by the internet, where numerous websites provide support,
information, and advice to sufferers of this controversial condition.
The role of the internet in the formation and maintenance of delusional
thinking has led some authors to label MD an <span
class="quote">"internet meme"</span> and <span class="quote">"folie a
internet."</span> Our case highlights the great lengths that patients
may go for symptom relief, and the potential harm associated with
unmonitored <span class="quote">"e-treatment"</span> from purported
experts. This is also the first known report of a patient whose beliefs
about having MD occurred with other clearly psychotic delusions,
suggesting a common etiology or perhaps a greater susceptibility of
individuals with psychosis to <span class="quote">"internet
memes."</span></p>

<p>Lee Merritt says that ivermectin cures vaccine-induced cancer,
because vaccines contain parasite eggs, parasites cause cancer, and
ivermectin kills parasites. Her parasite treatment protocol consists of
fenbendazole, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide.

the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> at BitChute (when I
excluded one video whose title had been edited later to add the term
<span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>). The video by KLA.tv had an
English voiceover which I believe was produced by KLA.tv, because they
have also added similar English voiceovers to their original

<p>KLA.tv is a conspiracy video website that is operated by a Swiss cult
called <span class="quote">"Organische Christus-Generation"</span>
(OCG). The studios of KLA.tv are located near OCG's compound, and OCG's

<p>In 2023 when I first did research on KLA.tv, the featured video on

featured video had been changed to a video of an Epoch Times article
about aluminum in vaccines. Epoch Times is operated by Falun Gong, whose
leader proclaimed himself to be the Lord Buddha of the Universe, who is
several times higher than Buddha and Jesus. He says that disembodied
alien souls have taught humans to develop technology so humans will
build clones which can be inhabited by alien souls, and then the aliens
will trick humans into outlawing natural reproduction, so that only
clones that are inhabited by alien souls will be left on the earth
(which is reminiscent of how Scientologists believe that humans are
possessed by the souls of evil aliens, which were trapped on the earth
when Xenu's prisoner transport ship crashed into a volcano).

nothing. The meter is not even necessary, but it does help the auditor

he said: <span class="quote">"As one progresses, cleans more and more
layers of charge off, and rehabilitates lost abilities, one acquires
tools (which in other situations might be called <span

<a href=#Ute_Kr_gers_article_about_turbo_cancer id=Ute_Kr_gers_article_about_turbo_cancer>Ute
Krüger's article about turbo cancer</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2024 Ute Krüger managed to get her article about turbo cancer
published as a reader-contributed article on the website of a major
German newspaper.
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/corona-impfstoffe-pathologin-warnt-diese-mrna-technik-ist-nicht-ausreichend-getestet-li.2259438>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>berliner-<wbr>zeitung.<wbr>de/<wbr>open-<wbr>source/<wbr>corona-<wbr>impfstoffe-<wbr>pathologin-<wbr>warnt-<wbr>diese-<wbr>mrna-<wbr>technik-<wbr>ist-<wbr>nicht-<wbr>ausreichend-<wbr>getestet-<wbr>li.<wbr>2259438</a>]
The main form of turbo cancer she focused on was breast cancer in young
women.</p>
<p>As evidence that there had been an increase in breast cancer in young
women, she cited phony analysis by Ed Dowd's group Phinance
Technologies. She wrote this in German: <span class="quote">"A
<a href=https://phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/UK%20Cause%20of%20death%20Project%20-%20Malignant%20Neoplasm%20Deaths%2015-44%20-%20Individual%20Causes.htm>study</a>
from the UK in October 2023 examined the cancer mortality rate of 15- to
44-year-olds. These are very young people for whom cancer has previously
been a rare cause of death. It was found that there was a 28 percent
increase in cancer deaths from breast cancer in women in 2022. Even more
alarming figures were found for pancreatic cancer: there was an 80
percent increase in deaths for women and 60 percent for men. In
addition, a 120 percent increase in deaths for men caused by black skin
cancer (melanoma) was found."</span> But the reason why Dowd's group
found an increase in cancer in 2022 was that they used an incorrect
method to impute deaths they thought were missing because of a
registration delay, because they assumed that cancer deaths had the same
proportion of missing deaths as the overall proportion of missing deaths
for all causes, even though in reality cancer deaths have a much shorter
registration delay than deaths from external causes, and Dowd's group
looked at deaths in ages 15 to 44 where a large part of all deaths are
due to external causes.

<p>The German newspaper later published a response to Ute Krüger's
article. They pointed out that her anecdotal claim of a rise in turbo
cancer was not supported by actual cancer statistics:
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/corona-impfstoffe-und-turbo-krebs-was-die-fallzahlen-aus-deutschland-verraten-li.2262993>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>berliner-<wbr>zeitung.<wbr>de/<wbr>gesundheit-<wbr>oekologie/<wbr>corona-<wbr>impfstoffe-<wbr>und-<wbr>turbo-<wbr>krebs-<wbr>was-<wbr>die-<wbr>fallzahlen-<wbr>aus-<wbr>deutschland-<wbr>verraten-<wbr>li.<wbr>2262993</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cancer registry shows that for a decade, between 72,600 and
75,6000 women in Germany have been diagnosed with breast cancer each
year. In 2022, around 74,500 women in Germany received the news that
they had the disease.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The number of breast cancer diagnoses is not increasing among younger
women either. Around 11,000 women between the ages of 30 and 49 in
Germany are diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time every year.
The number has been stable for many years - and it remained stable in
2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, whether the risk of dying from breast cancer is increasing
for individual patients can be better determined using the so-called
age-standardized mortality rate. How many patients out of 100,000 do not
survive their disease in a year? In 2018, the figure was 12.4 out of
100,000, and in 2023 - after the pandemic and vaccination campaign -
only 11.5 out of 100,000 died.</p>
<p>The same applies to all types of cancer taken together: the absolute
number of cases has been rising slightly for years. But if you take into
account the ageing of society, the mortality rate is falling
continuously, most recently from 147.6 per 100,000 cancer patients in
2018 to 137.5 per 100,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At the request of the Berliner Zeitung, the Center for Cancer
Registry Data therefore looked even deeper into the figures and, in
addition to the registry data and the cause of death statistics, also
evaluated the hospital data, particularly on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Here, too, the German data show no development that gives cause for
concern: <span class="quote">"We find no evidence of a higher incidence,
a higher mortality rate or an increased aggressive tumor behavior that
could be linked to the vaccination,"</span> says Klaus Kraywinkel, head
of the center.</p>
<p>The proportion of women with a poorly differentiated -
i.e. particularly malignant - tumor was a good 29 percent of all breast
cancer patients in the years 2018 to 2020. In 2021 and 2022 it even fell
slightly, to just over 28 percent. Poor differentiation could be an
indicator of particularly aggressive growth. So far, here too: all
clear.</p>
<p>The picture did not change in terms of the diagnosed tumor sizes
either. In 2018, doctors classified the tumor in six percent of the
affected women as being in the <span class="quote">"T3"</span> category
and in seven percent as being in the <span class="quote">"T4"</span>
category - these are the two largest types of tumor. In the following
years, these proportions remained unchanged - including in 2022.</p>

<p>Burkhardt collaborated with Sucharit Bhakdi, whose organization
Doctors for COVID Ethics organized a series of symposiums in partnership
with CHD, Solari, and UK Column.</p>
<p>One of the symposiums featured a presentation by the trio of Daniel
Broudy, David Hughes, and Valerie Kyrie.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/gold-standard-covid-science-in-practice-an-interdisciplinary-symposium-v-in-the-midst-of-darkness-light-prevails/>https://<wbr>doctors4covidethics.<wbr>org/<wbr>gold-<wbr>standard-<wbr>covid-<wbr>science-<wbr>in-<wbr>practice-<wbr>an-<wbr>interdisciplinary-<wbr>symposium-<wbr>v-<wbr>in-<wbr>the-<wbr>midst-<wbr>of-<wbr>darkness-<wbr>light-<wbr>prevails/<wbr></a>]
All three of them write for a website called Propaganda in Focus, and
all of them have a background in psychology or propaganda research.
David Hughes lectures in security studies and his areas of research
include <span class="quote">"psychological warfare"</span> and <span
class="quote">"the class relations behind psychological
operations"</span>.
[<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/our-team/>https://<wbr>propagandainfocus.<wbr>com/<wbr>our-<wbr>team/<wbr></a>]
Valerie Kyrie's bio says that she is <span class="quote">"working in the
areas of political psychology, the psychology of atrocity, and
psychological operations / perception management"</span> and that her
<span class="quote">"doctorate in psychology focused on the topic of
reality-perception and its manipulation"</span>.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/32>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>32</a>]
Daniel Broudy used to serve in military intelligence but he is now an
expert in propaganda.
[<a href=https://www.synaesthesiajournal.com/uploads/7/3/4/7/73473431/broudy_review_summer_2014.pdf>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>synaesthesiajournal.<wbr>com/<wbr>uploads/<wbr>7/<wbr>3/<wbr>4/<wbr>7/<wbr>73473431/<wbr>broudy_<wbr>review_<wbr>summer_<wbr>2014.<wbr>pdf</a>]
Broudy, Hughes, and Kyrie have written a series of papers about nanobots
that were published in the fake journal IJVTPR. The editorial board of
IJVTPR includes Mary Holland and Brian Hooker from CHD and Mark Skidmore
from Solari.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/about/editorialTeam>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>about/<wbr>editorialTeam</a>]</p>
<p>In another D4CE symposium, Daniel Broudy was interviewed by Taylor
Hudak from The Last American Vagabond, who is the lady who did
Burkhardt's final interview before his death.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/session-iv-understanding-tactics-of-oppression-2/>https://<wbr>doctors4covidethics.<wbr>org/<wbr>session-<wbr>iv-<wbr>understanding-<wbr>tactics-<wbr>of-<wbr>oppression-<wbr>2/<wbr></a>]
One article by Broudy, Hughes, and Kyrie was published on the website of
Whitney Webb, whose articles were published by The Last American
Vagabond before she started her own website.
[<a href=https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/11/investigative-reports/covid-19-mass-formation-or-mass-atrocity/>https://<wbr>unlimitedhangout.<wbr>com/<wbr>2022/<wbr>11/<wbr>investigative-<wbr>reports/<wbr>covid-<wbr>19-<wbr>mass-<wbr>formation-<wbr>or-<wbr>mass-<wbr>atrocity/<wbr></a>]</p>
<p>In 2024 Mary Holland from CHD interviewed Ana Mihalcea, who said that
blinking lights in an optical microscope video were nanobots, that she
found microchips that emitted MAC addresses in vaccines, that calamari
clots consist of dead blood cells eaten by nanobots, that there's
microelectronics from chemtrails in the blood of wild deer, and so on.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v5gadat-what-is-in-our-blood.html?start=2510>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>v5gadat-<wbr>what-<wbr>is-<wbr>in-<wbr>our-<wbr>blood.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=2510</a>]
Mary Holland had little critical to say to Mihalcea. When CHD caught
flak for posting the video, they responded by saying that Mihalcea's
claims were backed up by a presentation by Lissa Johnson, which was part
of an <span class="quote">"Omniwar"</span> symposium organized by Solari
and CHD.
[<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1846270778649550882>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>ChildrensHD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1846270778649550882</a>]
Lissa Johnson wrote her PhD thesis on the topic of <span
class="quote">"the psychological processes involved in manipulating
reality-perception"</span>, just like Valerie Kyrie.
[<a href=https://propagandainfocus.com/author/r_f29phidn_84_al7q/>https://<wbr>propagandainfocus.<wbr>com/<wbr>author/<wbr>r_<wbr>f29phidn_<wbr>84_<wbr>al7q/<wbr></a>]
The Omniwar symposium also featured presentations by David Hughes and
Daniel Broudy, and it was named after the <span
class="quote">"Omniwar"</span> concept coined by Hughes.</p>
<p>Broudy and Hughes are members of a group called International
Interdisciplinary Research Team (IIRT), whose members have also included
people like Ana Mihalcea, David Nixon, Mat Taylor, Shimon Yanowitz,
Sasha Latypova, Youngmi Lee, and Matt Shelton. IIRT's Brighteon channel
consists of interviews of the group's members by Daniel Broudy.
[<a href=https://www.brighteon.com/channels/iirteam/home>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>brighteon.<wbr>com/<wbr>channels/<wbr>iirteam/<wbr>home</a>]</p>
<p>Another member of IIRT is a German lady called Ulrike Granögger, who
is the host of Solari's Future Science series, where she has presented
videos about topics like 5G causing COVID, and the impact of nanobots on
the <span class="quote">"wave genome"</span>.
[<a href=https://science.solari.com>https://<wbr>science.<wbr>solari.<wbr>com</a>]
Catherine Austin Fitts said about Granögger that <span class="quote">"We
- Ulli and I - had a lot of experience with Arne Burkhardt"</span>.
[<a href=https://solari.com/mrna-will-we-figure-out-what-the-mysterious-ingredients-are-with-dr-suzanne-humphries/>https://<wbr>solari.<wbr>com/<wbr>mrna-<wbr>will-<wbr>we-<wbr>figure-<wbr>out-<wbr>what-<wbr>the-<wbr>mysterious-<wbr>ingredients-<wbr>are-<wbr>with-<wbr>dr-<wbr>suzanne-<wbr>humphries/<wbr></a>,
1:31:00]</p>
<p>The editorial board of IJVTPR also includes the IIRT member Shimon
Yanowitz. In 2024 IJVTPR published a paper by Youngmi Lee and Daniel
Broudy, who cited a presentation Yanowitz did for D4CE as evidence that
COVID vaccines contained nanotechnology.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/102>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>102</a>]
Yanowitz wrote he was active in CHD and D4CE: <span class="quote">"I am
active on several international groups such as: Children's Health
Defense, D4CE and Medical D4CE. I am one of the members of an
international group called IIRT (International Interdisciplinary
Research Team)."</span>

<p>In 2022 IJVTPR published a paper by David Hughes, where he compiled
microscope images published by various researchers who suggested that
vaccines contained microchips, hydras, Morgellons fibers, nanoantennas,
motherboards, graphene oxide razor blades, carbon nanotubes,
nano-octopuses, mesospores, SIM cards, Trypanosoma cruzi parasites,
hydrogel, microbubbles, long stick-like organisms, parasites attached to
magnets, eggs that were hatching new structures, geometric structures
that lit up when a mobile phone was used nearby, dark crystals,
microelectric circuitry, and so on, and he wrote that the researchers
must be onto something because <span class="quote">"at least 26
different investigations of the <span class="quote">'vaccine'</span>
contents (almost entirely unrelated to one another) from 16 different
countries on five continents converge on remarkably similar
findings"</span>.
[<a href=https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/52/288>https://<wbr>ijvtpr.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>IJVTPR/<wbr>article/<wbr>view/<wbr>52/<wbr>288</a>]
His paper had 8 pages of images from Burkhardt's pathology
conference:</p>

<img src=i/turbo-hughes.webp width=550>

<p>In a video with Mihalcea, Hughes also showed images from Burkhard's
conference next to images by Quinta Columna and the website
lifeoftheblood.com:
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/NKxjTRgM0tGn>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>NKxjTRgM0tGn</a>,

<div>
<img src=i/clot-lifeoftheblood-quinta.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In 2025 Suzanne Humphries started to say that lifeoftheblood.com was
her website, and she presented images from the website in a video
tweeted by CHD, and in a video she did with Catherine Austin Fitts.
[<a href=https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1934672856232726843>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>ChildrensHD/<wbr>status/<wbr>1934672856232726843</a>,
<a href=https://solari.com/mrna-will-we-figure-out-what-the-mysterious-ingredients-are-with-dr-suzanne-humphries/>https://<wbr>solari.<wbr>com/<wbr>mrna-<wbr>will-<wbr>we-<wbr>figure-<wbr>out-<wbr>what-<wbr>the-<wbr>mysterious-<wbr>ingredients-<wbr>are-<wbr>with-<wbr>dr-<wbr>suzanne-<wbr>humphries/<wbr></a>]
She said that Fitts gave her the impetus to come out of the closet as
the author of the images. In 2022 the same images had been presented by
the IIRT member Matt Shelton, who said they were taken by a team of
anonymous scientists in New Zealand.
[<a href=clot.html#Matt_Shelton>clot.<wbr>html#<wbr>Matt_<wbr>Shelton</a>]</p>
<p>In 2022 Matt Shelton did a video with Maria Zeee, where he claimed
that vaccines contained nanotechnology and graphene oxide, and as
evidence he presented images of supposed nanotechnology that were taken
with an optical microscope. Shelton said that he started researching
graphene and nanobots after he had been contacted by a patient who had
become magnetized after vaccination. And he said that his work was
following in the footsteps of La Quinta Columna and people in
Burkhardt's pathology conference:
[<a href=https://rumble.com/vy0fic-dr.-shelton-and-sue-grey-evidence-of-nanotechnology-and-graphene-oxide-in-c.html?start=604>https://<wbr>rumble.<wbr>com/<wbr>vy0fic-<wbr>dr.-<wbr>shelton-<wbr>and-<wbr>sue-<wbr>grey-<wbr>evidence-<wbr>of-<wbr>nanotechnology-<wbr>and-<wbr>graphene-<wbr>oxide-<wbr>in-<wbr>c.<wbr>html?<wbr>start=604</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, it was actually in response to having some patients contact us
who found that they had become magnetized after their vaccination. So we
had a look and met some people who, you know, indeed did seem to show
some magnetism. And we - so we did a science report - we did a little
research project, and came across La Quinta Columna and the work that
they had done. And in fact, Dr. Campra had already done his very
high-level science report where he had shown the presence of
graphene-based, you know, microstructures, you know - the word nano was
used, but now I refers to, you know, incredibly small scale, you know,
you're almost down at the sort of molecular level - whereas he and his
team were seeing things down a microscope. So as part of the report to
the government on people's magnetism concerns, we included what we'd
found around the graphene contamination and apparent chips and, you
know, electronic circuitry also, it seemed.</p>
<p>And shortly after that, a German team of pathologists had a very
powerful conference that they recorded and uploaded. And that's well
worth everybody looking at. And that was in two parts. In the first
half, they were describing the post-mortem findings and people who died
after vaccination. And they were reporting things that they'd never seen
in their whole careers. And in the second half, they were talking about
particles that had been found on microscopy of the vaccine itself. So we
first told government at the end of September last year that this stuff
was emerging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matt Shelton promoted Greg Harrison's ORF hoax, where Harrison
supposedly discovered new ORFs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 that
explained the formation of the calamari clots, and Shelton was credited
as an executive producer of a series of videos about the ORFs.
[<a href=clot.html#Matt_Shelton>clot.<wbr>html#<wbr>Matt_<wbr>Shelton</a>] Greg
Harrison is one of the people who have pretended to do a laboratory
analysis of the calamari clots, along with Mike Adams, Ryan Cole, Arne
Burkhardt, Ana Mihalcea, Clifford Carnicom, Diana Wojtkowiak, Zandre
Botha, Kevin McCairn, and Kevin McKernan. Apart from Greg Harrison's
crew, I believe Arne Burkhardt is the only person who is said to have
done a proteomics analysis on the clots (even though I'm fairly sure
that Greg's crew just generated fake proteomics data with AI, and I'm
convinced that the clots are not real, so Burkhardt may have not done a
real analysis of the clots either).

<p>Many anti-vaxxers have realized that the Stew Peters nanobot crowd is
controlled opposition, but occasionally if the nanobot stuff gets
promoted by some seemingly more credible source like CHD, anti-vaxxers
think it's an honest mistake on the part of CHD, or part of some clever
scheme by infiltrators to tarnish the reputation of CHD. That's the way
anti-vaxxers reacted when I told them that people in Burkhardt's
conference said that vaccines contained minirobots and parasites.</p>
<p>Burkhardt is generally respected by anti-vaxxers, which might be
because they don't know what he said or did, and they are not aware of
the quality of evidence he presented for his claims, but he was a
respectable-looking senior person who died, so anti-vaxxers think they
should respect him because of his age or because he died.</p>
<p>But if you think Burkhardt was just duped into including the nanobot
guys in his conference, you should realize that Burkhardt also had
Füllmich's assistant lady Viviane Fischer in his conference. And
Burkhardt's collaborator Sucharit Bhakdi had nanobot guys in his
symposiums, and the symposiums were held in collaboration with CHD and
Solari which have both promoted nanobots, and CHD and Solari later
organized similar symposiums whose stars were Hughes and Broudy. And the
images from Burkhardt's conference were promoted by the IIRT members
Hughes and Shelton. And Burkhardt was involved in the hoax about the
calamari clots.</p>
