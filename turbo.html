<p>The evidence for turbo cancer seems to be largely anecdotal, but
turbo cancer is nowhere to be found in actual cancer statistics. See

<p>I tried searching BitChute for the oldest videos at BitChute that
matched the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>. Many of the
oldest results were videos by German people:
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=%22turbo+cancer%22&sort=old>https://www.bitchute.com/search?query=%22turbo+cancer%22&amp;sort=old</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>In the screenshot above the 4th to 9th oldest results were all videos
of a German cancer pathologist called Ute Krüger, who lives in Sweden
but who speaks Swedish with a heavy German accent.</p>
<p>The oldest result above is a video from September 2021 where the
title did not originally include the term <span class="quote">"turbo
cancer"</span>, but the title of the video was edited some time between
November 2021 and December 2022.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20210930052406/https://www.bitchute.com/video/IeUcKnactfU1/>http://web.archive.org/web/20210930052406/https://www.bitchute.com/video/IeUcKnactfU1/</a>]</p>
<p>The second-oldest result was a video of a so-called <span
class="quote">"pathology conference"</span> that was held by Arne
Burkhardt on September 20th 2021 UTC.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/jRX63Ohu0l0g>https://www.bitchute.com/video/jRX63Ohu0l0g</a>]
The video was posted on the BitChute channel of KLA.tv, which is a
conspiracy video website that is run by a Swiss cult called <span
class="quote">"Organische Christus-Generation"</span>. Their leader Ivo
Sasek is connected to Jürg Stettler who is the head of Scientology in
Switzerland.</p>
<p>At first I thought the pathology conference was organized by Reiner
Füllmich, because it featured Viviane Fischer and it was reminiscent of
Füllmich's various operations. However Füllmich did not participate in
the conference and he wasn't mentioned anywhere on the website of the
conference.
[<a href=https://pathologie-konferenz.de>https://pathologie-konferenz.de</a>]
But the person who first used the phrase <span class="quote">"turbo
cancer"</span> during the conference was the German lawyer Elmar Becker,
who is a member of an organization called Lawyers for Enlightenment that
was co-founded by Füllmich.</p>
<p>In the video from Burkhardt's conference, a German doctor called Uta
Langer first showed a video that she claimed showed the contents of a
BioNTech vaccine vial under dark field microscopy. At time 12:53 she
said there was a crystalline structure that moved across the screen,
even though she said normally there shouldn't be any moving structures
in a vaccine vial (never mind that the structure she showed looks like
cholesterol which is a known ingredient of Pfizer vaccines):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-2.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Next Uta Langer showed the image below and said in German <span
class="quote">"in a different batch of BioNTech we find this, which
looks like - well, could be a chip"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-3.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>At time 17:45 she showed the following slide and said: <span
class="quote">"This again Johnson &amp; Johnson, with this little
aeroplane-like structure moving. We've seen this plane in many samples,
and it always has this shape, so it's not coincidental it has this
shape. We've seen it quite often."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-4.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 18:28 she showed the slide below and said: <span
class="quote">"This is blood of a vaccinated person. You can see the
money roll phenomenon here [stacking of red blood cells like a roll of
coins]. This is not a hair, it's not contamination, we have taken cloth
material. It looked like graphene layers, it's very very long. And it's
double light shedding. It means that it's a foreign body - maybe the
pathologist should explain - it's non-organic. So it's nothing biologic
that should be inside the body."</span> Then another person asked <span
class="quote">"Could this be Morgellons?"</span> And Langer answered
<span class="quote">"Morgellons - I've seen images shortly after this,
it looked like graphene layers. I can't say whether it's
Morgellons."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bitchute-5.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The pathology conference was divided into two parts, where the first
part dealt with Burkhardt's autopsy findings and the second part dealt
with analysis of microscope images. Videos of both parts with an English
voiceover were posted here:

class="uri">https://odysee.com/@SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic</a>.</a></p>
<p>The second part started out with a presentation by Axel Bolland, who
runs a quack doctoring practice at a spa where he employs techniques
like kirlian photography, homeopathy, bioresonance therapy, and
psychosomatic energetics.
[<a href=https://www.bollants.de/en/natural-medicine/felke-med/concept?item=91ba70e0-1a4f-4184-a18c-658ef29e543d>https://www.bollants.de/en/natural-medicine/felke-med/concept?item=91ba70e0-1a4f-4184-a18c-658ef29e543d</a>]
(Ute Krüger also has an alternative medical practice, and she claims she
is able to employ energy field technology to detect imbalances in the
energy field which is the <span class="quote">"non-material part through
which body and soul communicate"</span>.
[<a href=https://active-health.se/sv/metod>https://active-health.se/sv/metod</a>])</p>
<p>At time 8:27 Alex Bolland said this in the English dub: <span
class="quote">"If we look at the content of the vaccines, of course the
spike proteins, mRNA, and graphene oxide - I've seen pictures of that,
of groups, of people from Spain - I don't question this, whatever. I'm
happy to be called - what do we say - what do you call them - conspiracy
theorists, yes. I have also indications that there's mini-robots in the
blood. The earliest time I heard of this was in 95 in a presentation
from someone who was an expert. So I would say the people who are into
this vaccination are 30 years ahead. Thousands of scientists must have
worked on this."</span> A bullet point in his slides seemed to also
suggest that vaccines contained a parasite called <em>Treponasoma
cruzi</em>, even though he didn't discuss the bullet point in his
presentation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-bolland.png width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 33:56 in the second-part, someone called Maria-Hubmer Mogg
showed the image below and said: <span class="quote">"We don't know what
we're looking at here. If we have people experienced in microscopic work
- they say, sometimes this could look like a parasite, but this is just
the pure vaccine."</span></p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-parasite.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>At time 38:25 Maria Hubmer-Mogg said she saw this structure which
<span class="quote">"looks like a little SIM-card of a cell
phone"</span>, and she asked what it had to do in a so-called
vaccine:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-simcard.png width=500>
</div>
<p>An article about Burkhardt's pathology conference said the following
in German:
[<a href=https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/2021/09/25/mitglieder-der-pathologiekonferenz-verbreiten-unbelegte-behauptungen-ueber-covid-19-impfungen-und-todesfaelle/>https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/2021/09/25/mitglieder-der-pathologiekonferenz-verbreiten-unbelegte-behauptungen-ueber-covid-19-impfungen-und-todesfaelle/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is suspected that neither Burkhardt nor Lang performed
autopsies on these people themselves, but had samples and organs sent to
them from Germany and Austria. In his lecture, Burkhardt explains (in
the video 18:19 to 18:38): <span class="quote">"The Austrians were the
ones who provided the best specimens and information."</span> One of his
main activities was to compile the data: <span class="quote">"Because at
some point the organs were lying in my possession and I didn't even know
what they were for."</span></p>
<p>Where the samples and organs come from remains unclear, as do the
examination methods used.</p>
<p>The team from the German Autopsy Register for Covid-19 Infections
complained to CORRECTIV.Faktencheck that the criteria for selecting the
cases were <span class="quote">"unclear"</span>. The entire <span
class="quote">"method of evaluation"</span> was not comprehensible and
there was a lack of information on previous illnesses and other relevant
clinical data.</p>
<p>Professional associations describe the results of the <span
class="quote">"Pathology Conference"</span> as <span
class="quote">"scientifically unfounded"</span> The result of their
investigations, says Burkhardt in the video, is that in five out of ten
of the deaths examined, a connection with a vaccination against Covid-19
is <span class="quote">"very likely"</span> and in two cases <span
class="quote">"probable"</span>.</p>
<p>The autopsy registry team is also critical of this classification. No
reasons were given as to which cases were assigned to which category and
why. No <span class="quote">"decision criteria"</span> were given for
these assignments, and <span class="quote">"a causal chain of the cause
of death"</span> was not established. There is therefore no evidence
that a vaccination against Covid-19 really led to death in the cases
examined.</p>
<p>We also asked two associations of pathologists for an assessment of
the results. The Federal Association of German Pathologists (BDP) wrote
to us: <span class="quote">"To our knowledge, the opinions expressed in
the video by Professor Burkhardt and Professor Lang are currently
neither sufficiently scientifically substantiated nor are they available
in a format worthy of comment."</span> Before they are made public,
according to the BDP, the results should be presented and discussed in
specialist circles on the basis of sufficient data.</p>
<p>The German Society for Pathology (DGP) also writes to us that <span
class="quote">"the data presented"</span> in the video are <span
class="quote">"not scientifically based"</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During her presentation Uta Langer showed the image below and said
<span class="quote">"This image was six months after the vaccination,
and we see these metal splinters dancing in the blood"</span>:
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics:3/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic:1?t=1232>https://odysee.com/@SnakeOilPolitics:3/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic:1?t=1232</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-splinters.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Maria Hubmer-Mogg also said that a vaccine sample contained sharp
metallic structures: <span class="quote">"As we're seeing here appear,
this is metallic structures - I think you see my mouse as well - we see
the special specific small color chips without wanting to define what a
chip may be. We have these Y-type structures as well. And here again, as
we've seen before in the observations, metallic structures, we'd have to
decide what that is. And this ring is what we saw here. Also again, a
kind of chip-like structure and a bigger metal type of structure.
Something that is very pointed and sharp."</span>
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?t=1870>https://odysee.com/@SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?t=1870</a>]</p>
<p>However Burkhardt also claimed that the tissue samples he analyzed
contained metallic structures, but they may have in fact been
cholesterol:

<p>It was a pity that no results of histological examinations with
immunofluorescence were made or shown. Such things can be done easily
and quickly with today's technology.</p>
<p>It was also a pity that the microscopic analyses of the vaccines were
done in an amateurish way:</p>
<ul>
<li>No scale bar available in any image (always very annoying.
Complicates the interpretation)</li>
<li>No quantitative analysis of the particle characteristics, no
statistical analysis</li>
<li>No 3D volume rendering of 3D microscopic image stacks (that would be
very helpful to characterize the foreign bodies)</li>
<li>No fluorescence microscopy</li>
<li>No mass spectroscopy</li>
<li>No electron microscopy</li>
<li>No energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (analysis of
elemental composition)</li>
<li>No quantitative analysis, no statistical analysis</li>

term turbo cancer was first used by Elmar Becker who was a member of
Füllmich's organization</a>
</h2>
<p>During Burkhardt's pathology conference in September 2021, a German
lawyer called Elmar Becker conveyed the following anecdote about breast
cancer from an anonymous female doctor, who was probably Ute Krüger.
Becker said this in the English dub of the video from the conference:
<span class="quote">"She gave me an example which I'd like to share here
anonymously: <span class="quote">'The lady - 70 years old - had breast
cancer, and this breast cancer was well under control, and it didn't
grow anymore'</span> - I have to note here that with elderly people
cancer does not grow as quick as fast as with younger people - now the
lady was vaccinated, and the colleague told me, <span
class="quote">'after six weeks this tumor - this breast cancer - started
to grow again. In the end it had to be - undergo surgery after six
months because it had exploded. It had a starting size of 1-1-1 in the
three dimensions. After about three months it was 14-14 and when it was
removed after six months - so you see how telescoped things are here -
it was 16-16-16.'</span> So with me that raised the question: can it be
that this is in the context of the vaccination, and could it be that in
the question discussed in the literature or now by immune suppression
plays a role? I would like to look at this question with Dr. Bolland,
and maybe you could explain to us what you have found in blood
examinations, and how you could explain certain possible context and
correlations - when correlated to what I would call <span
class="red">turbo cancer</span> - of course medically not quite correct
- but impressive and clear."</span>
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?start=107>https://odysee.com/@SnakeOilPolitics/Death-by-Vaccination-Part-II-of-the-press-conference-from-the-Institute-of-Pathology-in-Reutlingen-on-the-topic?start=107</a>]
So I believe that may have been the first ever public use of the term
<span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> in a vaccine-related context
(or <span class="quote">"turbokrebs"</span> in the original German
version).</p>
<p>At time 59:54 in the same video, Elmar Becker said: <span
class="quote">"We are moving into this project now to look at this
phenomenon of the turbo cancer, which is not proven yet, but where we
have to move into an observation study, now, scientifically. I've been
coached by a university who will accompany this, we have a research
design, and we're carrying on."</span></p>
<p>An article about turbo cancer in a German wiki said that the <span
class="quote">"author of the term is a lawyer named Elmar Becker (member
of
<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Anw%C3%A4lte_f%C3%BCr_Aufkl%C3%A4rung>Lawyers
for Enlightenment</a>), who used the term at a pathology
conference"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Turbokrebs>https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Turbokrebs</a>]</p>
<p>The organization Anwälte für Aufklärung (<span class="quote">"Lawyers
for Enlightenment"</span> or <span class="quote">"Lawyers for
Clarification"</span>) was co-founded by the German lawyers Gordon
Pankalla and Reiner Füllmich. It's interesting that Gordon Pankalla has
an English name, because Arne Burkhardt, Reiner Füllmich, and Sucharit
Bhakdi have all lived in the United States, and in general people in the
non-English-speaking alternative media often seem to have a connection
to English-speaking countries.</p>
<p>In 2021 Lawyers for Enlightenment organized a <span
class="quote">"secret project meeting"</span> which also included two
people from Kla.TV:

<a href=#Burkhardts_autopsy_findings id=Burkhardts_autopsy_findings>Burkhardt's
autopsy findings</a>
</h2>
<p>The term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> seems to have been
introduced during Arne Burkhardt's pathology conference in September
2021. When people from the Federal Association of German Pathologists
were asked to comment on the findings presented in Burkhardt's
conference, they answered that the findings presented in the conference
were not <span class="quote">"available in a format worthy of
comment"</span>, and they requested that the findings should be <span
class="quote">"presented and discussed in specialist circles on the
basis of sufficient data"</span>.
[<a href=https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/2021/09/25/mitglieder-der-pathologiekonferenz-verbreiten-unbelegte-behauptungen-ueber-covid-19-impfungen-und-todesfaelle/>https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/2021/09/25/mitglieder-der-pathologiekonferenz-verbreiten-unbelegte-behauptungen-ueber-covid-19-impfungen-und-todesfaelle/</a>]</p>
<p>On the website of Burkhardt's conference, I didn't see any scientific
publication about their findings, but only videos, Powerpoint slides,
and a press release.
[<a href=https://pathologie-konferenz.de/Tod_nach_COVID-19-Impfung_www_pathologie-konferenz_de.pdf>https://pathologie-konferenz.de/Tod_nach_COVID-19-Impfung_www_pathologie-konferenz_de.pdf</a>]
In fact I didn't find any scientific paper published by Burkhardt since
2012.
[<a href=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&q=arne+burkhardt>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&amp;q=arne+burkhardt</a>,

<p>In December 2021 Arne Burkhardt and Sucharit Bhakdi did a
presentation about Burkhardt's findings for Bhakdi's organization
Doctors for COVID Ethics, and Bhakdi and Burkhardt also coauthored a
short 4-page article about their presentation. But the article contained
little details and it was not structured like a scientific paper.
[<a href=https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-covax.pdf>https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-covax.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>The paper by Bhakdi and Burkhardt featured a table of 15 cases of
people who are suspected to have died due to vaccination. But one of the
people is supposed to have been 95 years old and died 68 days after
vaccination, and another person is supposed to have been 89 years old
and died 6 months after vaccination:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-burkhardttable.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Bhakdi and Burkhardt wrote: <span class="quote">"Because vaccination
was the single common denominator between all cases, there can be no
doubt that it was the trigger of self-destruction in these deceased
individuals."</span> But how can they know that the death of the 89-year
old who died about 6 months after vaccination was triggered by
vaccination? They didn't provide a detailed description of any of the
cases or any case-by-case reasoning of why they attributed each death to
vaccination. And Bhakdi and Burkhardt wrote that they selected the 15
cases they analyzed because they were people who had died after
vaccination, so it's not very surprising that vaccination would've been
a <span class="quote">"common denominator between all cases"</span>.</p>
<p>Bhakdi and Burkhardt also wrote: <span class="quote">"Not a single
death was brought into any possible association with the vaccination by
the coroner or the public prosecutor; this association was only
established by our autopsy findings."</span> So it seems Burkhardt's
attribution of the deaths to vaccination was not necessarily supported
by other lines of evidence. However it's not clear if the autopsies were
originally peformed for the purpose of determining whether the deaths
were due to vaccination or not, or if the coroners even looked for
evidence that the deaths were caused by vaccination.</p>
<p>The main reason why Burkhardt attributed the deaths to vaccination
seems to have been that the tissues he examined had a high concentration
of t-lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cells. However
Correktiv wrote: <span class="quote">"The team of the autopsy register
also told us that the pictures were misinterpreted. Many showed
collections of lymphocytes, <span class="quote">'as they would be found
in many post-mortem cases'</span>. Benjamin Ondruschka, director of the
Institute for Forensic Medicine at the University Hospital
Hamburg-Eppendorf, made a similar statement in September 2021 to
<a href=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/plus233927158/Pathologen-Pressekonferenz-Angebliche-Befunde-zu-Impftoten.html>Die
Welt</a> with a view of pictures of the heart."</span></p>
<p>The article by Die Welt was behind a paywall, but it was copied here:

The article also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Benjamin Ondruschka, Director of the Institute of Forensic
Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, watched the
lecture. He watched the press conference with two experienced colleagues
- but had trouble following. <span class="quote">"It wasn't clear to me
exactly what the two of them were talking about until the end,"</span>
he says. <span class="quote">"They didn't say where they got these
samples or preparations from, whether they were slides that had been
presented to them by other pathologists or forensic doctors for a second
opinion, whether they were particularly difficult cases, whether the
patients had shown symptoms during their lifetime. But that is really
important for the assessment. The cases seemed to be very heterogeneous,
in some cases with time intervals of several months between vaccination
and death."</span></p>
<p>The tissue images presented during the press conference also do not
convince Ondruschka that there is a vaccination scandal. <span
class="quote">"In one image, for example, we saw isolated inflammatory
cells in the heart muscle,"</span> he says. <span class="quote">"But
such a small finding doesn't kill you. Such individual cells are always
found in tissue sections. Even if you were to take a blood sample from
me now, it would contain white blood cells (lymphocytes). They belong in
the blood."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkhardt's presentation was part of a symposium by Doctors for COVID
Ethics and it was livestreamed by UK Column, but I think both Doctors
for COVID Ethics and UK Column are controlled opposition.</p>
<p>Another symposium by Doctors for COVID Ethics featured a presentation
by Shimon Yanowitz.

blood contained an entity that might have been Morgellons, and that
looked very mean and made red blood cells nervous:

<p>Ute Krüger lives in Sweden, but she speaks Swedish with a heavy
German accent. She was not a speaker in Burkhardt's first pathology
conference which seems to have introduced the concept of <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> to the world, even though she
somehow emerged as one of the early experts on turbo cancer in alt
media. However she was a speaker at Burkhardt's second pathology
conference which was held in December 2021.

class="quote">"I work with information field technology. The information

<p>The Swedish word for <span class="quote">"information field

this:
[<a href=https://timewaver.com/international/en/the-information-field/>https://timewaver.com/international/en/the-information-field/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The so-called Information Field is originally part of a unified field
theory, formulated by German physicist Burkhard Heim (a student of
Werner Heisenberg) in the late 1970s. Heim had thereby pursued a task at
which many renowned physicists, for example Albert Einstein or Stephen
Hawking, had so far ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Burkhard Heim's field theory is based on a world view comprising 12
dimensions. In Burkhard Heim's model, the Information Field is localized
in the 7th and 8th dimensions. Its meaning goes far beyond physics: It
is the level of our existence where all answers to all questions are
stored, our predetermination and all knowledge.</p>
<p>TimeWaver technology is based on the theory that the essence and
function of the Information Field can be purposefully applied by those
who are familiar with it. It is about retrieving all the information
about a person's mind and body that is stored in the Information Field
of the Earth and the Universe; the positive as well as the negative, the
strengths as well as the weaknesses, the normalities as well as the
abnormalities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In October 2024 a German newspaper published a reader-contributed
article by Ute Krüger about turbo cancer.
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/corona-impfstoffe-pathologin-warnt-diese-mrna-technik-ist-nicht-ausreichend-getestet-li.2259438>https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/corona-impfstoffe-pathologin-warnt-diese-mrna-technik-ist-nicht-ausreichend-getestet-li.2259438</a>]
The main form of turbo cancer she focused on was breast cancer in young
women.</p>
<p>However as evidence that there had been an increase in breast cancer
in young women, she cited phony analysis by Ed Dowd's group Phinance
Technologies. She wrote this in German: <span class="quote">"A
<a href=https://phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/UK%20Cause%20of%20death%20Project%20-%20Malignant%20Neoplasm%20Deaths%2015-44%20-%20Individual%20Causes.htm>study</a>
from the UK in October 2023 examined the cancer mortality rate of 15- to
44-year-olds. These are very young people for whom cancer has previously
been a rare cause of death. It was found that there was a 28 percent
increase in cancer deaths from breast cancer in women in 2022. Even more
alarming figures were found for pancreatic cancer: there was an 80
percent increase in deaths for women and 60 percent for men. In
addition, a 120 percent increase in deaths for men caused by black skin
cancer (melanoma) was found."</span> But the reason why Dowd's group
found an increase in cancer deaths in 2022 was that they used an
incorrect method to add in deaths they thought were missing because of a
registration delay, because they assumed that cancer deaths had the same
proportion of missing deaths as the overall proportion of missing deaths
for all causes, even though in reality cancer deaths have a much shorter
registration delay than deaths from external causes, and Dowd's group
looked at cancer deaths in ages 15 to 44 where a large part of all
deaths are due to external causes.

<p>The German newspaper later published a response to Ute Krüger's
article. They pointed out that her anecdotal claim of a rise in turbo
cancer was not supported by actual cancer statistics:
[<a href=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/corona-impfstoffe-und-turbo-krebs-was-die-fallzahlen-aus-deutschland-verraten-li.2262993>https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/corona-impfstoffe-und-turbo-krebs-was-die-fallzahlen-aus-deutschland-verraten-li.2262993</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cancer registry shows that for a decade, between 72,600 and
75,6000 women in Germany have been diagnosed with breast cancer each
year. In 2022, around 74,500 women in Germany received the news that
they had the disease.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The number of breast cancer diagnoses is not increasing among younger
women either. Around 11,000 women between the ages of 30 and 49 in
Germany are diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time every year.
The number has been stable for many years - and it remained stable in
2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, whether the risk of dying from breast cancer is increasing
for individual patients can be better determined using the so-called
age-standardized mortality rate. How many patients out of 100,000 do not
survive their disease in a year? In 2018, the figure was 12.4 out of
100,000, and in 2023 - after the pandemic and vaccination campaign -
only 11.5 out of 100,000 died.</p>
<p>The same applies to all types of cancer taken together: the absolute
number of cases has been rising slightly for years. But if you take into
account the ageing of society, the mortality rate is falling
continuously, most recently from 147.6 per 100,000 cancer patients in
2018 to 137.5 per 100,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At the request of the Berliner Zeitung, the Center for Cancer
Registry Data therefore looked even deeper into the figures and, in
addition to the registry data and the cause of death statistics, also
evaluated the hospital data, particularly on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Here, too, the German data show no development that gives cause for
concern: <span class="quote">"We find no evidence of a higher incidence,
a higher mortality rate or an increased aggressive tumor behavior that
could be linked to the vaccination,"</span> says Klaus Kraywinkel, head
of the center.</p>
<p>The proportion of women with a poorly differentiated -
i.e. particularly malignant - tumor was a good 29 percent of all breast
cancer patients in the years 2018 to 2020. In 2021 and 2022 it even fell
slightly, to just over 28 percent. Poor differentiation could be an
indicator of particularly aggressive growth. So far, here too: all
clear.</p>
<p>The picture did not change in terms of the diagnosed tumor sizes
either. In 2018, doctors classified the tumor in six percent of the
affected women as being in the <span class="quote">"T3"</span> category
and in seven percent as being in the <span class="quote">"T4"</span>
category - these are the two largest types of tumor. In the following
years, these proportions remained unchanged - including in 2022.</p>

<p>In 2021 before the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was

increase in endometrial cancers, and that cancer was now <span
class="quote">"accelerated"</span> so that it progressed to an advanced
stage faster than earlier:

<p>On September 24th 2021 UTC which was only 4 days after Burkhardt's
pathology conference, Del Bigtree published an interview with Ryan Cole
where Cole said vaccines cause cancer, and he said: <span
class="quote">"I'll have a call later with three German pathologists.
They're seeing similar signals. They're gonna be working on it as well.
But it's based -. Another colleague in Dallas is gonna be working on it.
We're trying to get a consortium of doctors together to study
this."</span>

The three German pathologists probably referred to Arne Burkhardt,
Walter Lang, and Ute Krüger. In 2023 Arne Burkhardt was asked if there
were other pathologists who had been able to confirm his findings, but
the only pathologist he named was Ryan Cole.
[<a href=https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/>https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/arne-burkhardt-interview-12-23-23/</a>,
1:51:54]</p>
<p>When Ryan Cole said he had a colleague in Dallas, he probably
referred to the oncologist Ray Page. When I searched Twitter for <span
class="quote">"turbokrebs"</span>, one of the earliest tweets I found
was a clip of a presentation by Ray Page from a conference in Texas. The
bottom of the video had a watermark for Falun Gong's media outlet New
Tang Dynasty:
[<a href=https://x.com/DieechteBecky/status/1464354134010830857>https://x.com/DieechteBecky/status/1464354134010830857</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-ntd.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The conference in Texas was livestreamed on the YouTube channel of
Epoch Times. Other speakers in the conference included Peter McCullough,
Ryan Cole, and Bryan Ardis. The presentation by Ray Page was actually
fairly reasonable, and he didn't make the kind of wild claims like Ryan
Cole who was saying there was a 10-to-20-fold increase in certain types
of cancer. Page referred to Ryan Cole as saying that vaccines may have
caused or accelerated cancer, but Page said he had not yet seen an
increase in cancer himself: <span class="quote">"So the question of
whether this can cause cancer or not: Dr Cole as a pathologist has seen
a lot of signals in his his practice looking at the pathologic features.
We know that viruses can cause cancer, you know the Epstein-Barr, herpes
virus HIV, human papilloma virus, and we even have some vaccines that
can potentially mitigate some of that. But there's potential laboratory
signals that are suggesting that there's interactions with these spike
proteins with certain cancer genes, which has the possibility to cause
or accelerate cancer. Now I haven't seen that clinically yet and I

to really keep our eyes open."</span>

<p>I found a German article published two weeks after Burkhardt's
conference which said that said there were <span class="quote">"numerous
reports of explosive cancer after covid-19 vaccination"</span>. It said
that the term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was coined at
the pathology conference:
[<a href=https://report24.news/zahlreiche-berichte-von-explosivem-krebsgeschehen-nach-covid-19-impfung/>https://report24.news/zahlreiche-berichte-von-explosivem-krebsgeschehen-nach-covid-19-impfung/</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-coined.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The same German article cited Ryan Cole as a source that COVID
vaccines had caused an increase in cancer and that cancers were now more
aggressive than earlier:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/turbo-germancole.png width=500>
</div>
<p>So it's interesting that two weeks after the term <span
class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> was coined by Germans, a German
article about turbo cancer was already quoting Ryan Cole as an expert on
turbo cancer.</p>
<p>In July 2021 Ryan Cole became a <span class="quote">"Medical
Director"</span> of the Jew Simone Gold's organization America's
Frontline Doctors. The news team of America's Frontline Doctors is run
out of Israel by the Kahanist Chabadnik Mordechai Sones.
[<a href=https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads>https://reinettesenumsfoghornexpress.substack.com/p/americas-frontline-doctors-all-roads</a>]
Sones also hosted the podcast of AFLDS which is now inactive, but during
the last episode of the podcast he read out a letter by the Rebbe
Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
[<a href=https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah>https://soundcloud.com/aflds/letter-on-science-and-torah</a>]
Before COVID Mordechai Sones worked for Israeli mainstream media, and in
the 80s he worked on <span class="quote">"research in areas of how to
upgade CIA covert arms pipeline to Afghans"</span>:

<p>When Ryan Cole's medical license was revoked, one of the charges
brought against him was that he had prescribed ivermectin at
MyFreeDoctor.com without obtaining proper informed consent: <span
class="quote">"Beginning in June 2021, the Respondent provided direct
care to several patients via telemedicine using the website
MyFreeDoctor.com. This involved a virtual platform that relied on
instant message chat instead of a phone call or video; thus, the
Respondent could neither see nor hear the patients. A disclaimer on the
platform stated that ivermectin was not approved by the FDA, but that
evidence supported its use."</span>
[<a href=https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf>https://lymescience.org/rogues/Ryan-Cole/Ryan-Neil-Cole-charges-and-findings-of-unprofessional-conduct-WA-2024.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>AFLDS was also affiliated with another similar telehealth website
called SpeakWithAnMD.com, which was launched by Jerome Corsi in April
2020. Jerome Corsi has managed two mutual funds for B'nai B'rith, and in
2004 he told The Forward that <span class="quote">"I've been a strong
supporter of B'nai B'rith and Jewish causes for 30 years"</span>.
[<a href=https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/>https://forward.com/news/5291/campaign-confidential-58/</a>]
A report about Corsi's website said: <span class="quote">"America's
Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) - a leading purveyor of coronavirus
misinformation - refers patients to SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that
SpeakWithAnMD.com provides phone consultations with <span
class="quote">'AFLDS-trained physicians'</span> willing to prescribe
hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and other unproven treatments. According
to recent reports, AFLDS referred over 255,000 individuals to
SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16, 2021, and September 12, 2021 -
approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for initial phone consultations
and many of whom had follow-up consultations for an additional
$60."</span>
[<a href=https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/2021.10.29%20Lettrer%20to%20SpeakWithAnMD%20re%20Misinformation.pdf>https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/2021.10.29%20Lettrer%20to%20SpeakWithAnMD%20re%20Misinformation.pdf</a>]
So that's over 6 million USD in the initial consulting fees over less
than two months through a single referrer alone.</p>
<p>The three products that were initially promoted on Corsi's website
were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc, which are the three
components of the Chabadnik Vladimir Zelenko's protocol.

Corsi's website offered prescriptions for HCQ and azithromycin, but his
website had a partnership with an online pharmacy called Bonsa Health
which shipped the drugs and which also sold zinc. At the Wayback Machine
the earliest snapshot of bonsahealth.com is from March 2020 and the last
snapshot is from August 2020.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200426185547/https://www.bonsahealth.com/>http://web.archive.org/web/20200426185547/https://www.bonsahealth.com/</a>]
Global News Wire had 4 press releases published by Bonsa Health, where
the earliest release from April 2020 said they had partnered with Encore
Telemedicine which was the parent company of SpeakWithAnMD.com.
[<a href=https://rss.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/Bonsa%2520Health>https://rss.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/Bonsa%2520Health</a>]
So Bonsa Health might have been set up for the purpose of selling drugs
prescribed by Corsi's website.</p>
<p>One Twitter user wrote: <span class="quote">"You can use

Ivermectin typically costs about 1 USD per 3 mg tablet, and the
recommended dose for treating river blindness or threadworms consists of
a single dose of about 4-5 tablets for a body weight of 150 pounds.

</h2>
<p>In October 2021 Mike Adams published an article titled <span
class="quote">"THE VACCINE-CANCER ATROCITY: Like clockwork, most
vaccinated Americans will lose immune function by Christmas and start
growing accelerated CANCER tumors that will kill them over the next ten
years"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-29-the-vaccine-cancer-atrocity-like-clockwork-most-vaccinated-americans-will-lose-immune-function-by-christmas-and-start-growing-accelerated-cancer-tumors-that-will-kill-them-over-the-next-ten-years.html>https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-29-the-vaccine-cancer-atrocity-like-clockwork-most-vaccinated-americans-will-lose-immune-function-by-christmas-and-start-growing-accelerated-cancer-tumors-that-will-kill-them-over-the-next-ten-years.html</a>]
He cited Ryan Cole as a source that there had been an increase in
cancer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Idaho, Dr. Ryan Cole, a diagnostics lab owner, is already
reporting a 2000% increase in cancers among those who took the vaccines.
<span class="quote">"Since January 1, in the laboratory, I'm seeing a
20-times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual
basis,"</span> Cole stated in the video. <span class="quote">"I'm not
exaggerating at all because I look at my numbers year over year, and I'm
like <span class="quote">'Gosh, I've never seen this many endometrial
cancers before.'</span>"</span></p>
<p>Watch Dr. Ryan Cole explain all this in his own words via this
Brighteon video:<br>

<p>In children, post-vaccine cancers will take longer to develop, so
they may evade cancer death for many years. But in adults who are
already growing micro tumors - and nearly everyone is already doing that
- the loss of immune function will result in the rapid acceleration and
spread of cancer, overwhelming their bodies in a matter of a few months
to a few years, depending on their health status when the vaccines were
first injected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article by Mike Adams was copied on many different websites:

<p>The article by Mike Adams said that <span class="quote">"most
vaccinated Americans will lose immune function by Christmas"</span>. He
referred to an article by Expose News that had been published three
weeks earlier, which said: <span class="quote">"UK PHE Vaccine
Surveillance Report figures on Covid cases show that doubly vaccinated
40-70 year olds have lost 40% of their immune system capability compared
to unvaccinated people. Their immune systems are deteriorating at around
5% per week (between 2.7% and 8.7%). If this continues then 30-50 year
olds will have 100% immune system degradation, zero viral defence by
Christmas and all doubly vaccinated people over 30 will have lost their
immune systems by March next year."</span>

The article also said that everybody over the age of 30 years old would
have developed AIDS by the first half of 2022: <span
class="quote">"Everybody over 30 will have lost 100% of their entire
immune capability (for viruses and certain cancers) within 6 months.
30-50 year olds will have lost it by Christmas. These people will then
effectively have full blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and
destroy the NHS."</span> The article by Expose News was copy pasted by
Robert Malone on Twitter in November 2024, but he didn't even link to
the original source of the article, and his tweet said the article was
from 2024 even though actually it was from 2021.

(Malone or whoever runs his account later deleted the tweet, but his
tweet was still a great demonstration of the journalistic standards of
the so-called medical freedom movement.)</p>
<p>Mike Adams also has connections to Scientology like Reiner Füllmich
and Ivo Sasek. The Citizens Commission on Human Rights is an
anti-psychiatry organization that was founded by the Church of
Scientology, but at one point the featured video on their YouTube
channel was a documentary by Mike Adams.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHC2wH_iGYM>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHC2wH_iGYM</a>]
In 2011 CCHR republished an article by Mike Adams about how Jim Marrs
had received the NaturalNews 2011 Book Of The Year Award, but the
article mentioned that both Mike Adams and Jim Marrs had also won a
<span class="quote">"CCHR Human Rights Award"</span>.

In 2006 Mike Adams wrote: <span class="quote">"Want to learn more

In 2007 Mike Adams wrote about the history of tyranny by the FDA, where
he wrote that the FDA tried to unfairly regulate the use of E-meters:
<span class="quote">"In the early 1960s, the FDA got word of something
it didn't like: The Church of Scientology was helping its members
overcome mental problems with the use of a simple biofeedback device
called the E-meter. With the market for psychotropic drugs so
consistently profitable, and with Scientology gaining momentum in
helping millions of people overcome severe emotional and mental
problems, this E-meter had to be taken out of play... and fast!"</span>

<p>On January 1st 2020 UTC Alex Jones did a special episode of InfoWars
that was focused around the theme of vaccines and viruses. First the
fake Google whistleblower Zach Vorhies did a long presentation about the
measles outbreak in Samoa in 2019. Alex Jones said that he and Rob Dew
had been working on the presentation for about three weeks.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/EltOsRbp5dSe/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/EltOsRbp5dSe/</a>,
time 47:30] After that Mike Adams took over the show, and he said: <span
class="quote">"Thank you for joining me the first day here of 2020, a
year that I believe will be the most memorable in our lifetimes. The
things that are about to happen this year. I'll cover some of them
today, but trust me, you're going to look back at this and say, whoa,
how did we get through that? And I can't believe how much change. It's
going to be really extraordinary at levels that you probably can't even
imagine right now. I'm going to cover some breaking news today, get into
some analysis. There is an Ebola false flag operation being engineered,
I believe, to infect Americans with Ebola in order to push Ebola scare.
And the new Ebola vaccine that has just been approved by the FDA and a
new Ebola testing system that's been rolled out by the CDC that causes
false positives so that they can quarantine you and take you away, throw
you in a room with other actually sick people, and they can shut down
entire cities and communities and create Ebola scare. So I will be
talking about that. But trust me, I mean, mark my words. Again, this was
January 1. Sometime this year, there's going to be an Ebola outbreak
most likely in the United States."</span> So even though Mike Adams said
that there would be an outbreak of Ebola and not a coronavirus, he still
said that 2020 was going to be the most memorable year of our lifetimes
because there was going to be an outbreak of a virus. So did he know
about COVID in advance? The virus-themed episode of InfoWars on January
1st 2020 almost seemed like a special episode which commemorated the
start of the COVID year.</p>

<p>Before COVID Raphael Stricker published at least 13 papers about
Morgellons disease, and he was possibly the main person responsible for
popularizing the Morgellons hoax.
[<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael-Stricker>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael-Stricker</a>]
For example one of Stricker's papers featured these photos of Morgellons

<p>The name Morgellons disease was coined in 2002 by Mary Leitao, whose
3-year-old son had skin lesions with fibers of various colors embedded
in the lesions. She named the disease after a medical condition
described in 1674 by the English polymath Thomas Browne, who wrote:
<span class="quote">"Hairs which have most amused me have not been in
the face or head, but on the Back, and not in Men but Children, as I
long ago observed in that endemial distemper of little Children in
Languedock, called the Morgellons, wherein they critically break out
with harsh Hairs on their Backs, which takes off the unquiet symptoms of
the Disease, and delivers them from Coughs and Convulsions."</span>
[<a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/letter/letter.html>http://penelope.uchicago.edu/letter/letter.html</a>]
In 2002 Mary Leitao formed a non-profit organization called Morgellons
Research Foundation, whose two advisory board members were the
alternative medical practicioners Raphael Stricker and Victoria Savely.
In 2006 Stricker also coauthored a paper about Morgellons disease with
Leitao and Savely.

<p>In 2019 the California Medical Board issued a complaint against
Raphael Stricker, which said that Stricker had prescribed ivermectin as
a treatment for Morgellons disease without obtaining informed consent:

<p>An article by Forbes said: <span class="quote">"In 1990 Stricker was

spent two years as associate medical director at a penis enlargement
clinic."</span>

In 1993 the Office of Research Integrity of the NIH issued a notice
which said: <span class="quote">"An investigation conducted by the
University found that Dr. Stricker falsified data for a manuscript and a
PHS-supported publication reporting research on AIDS. In the manuscript,
Dr. Stricker selectively suppressed data that did not support his
hypothesis, and reported consistently positive data whereas only one of
four experiments had produced positive results. In the publication,
Dr. Stricker reported that an antibody was found in 29 of 30
homosexuals, but not found in non-homosexuals. However, Dr. Stricker's
control data, which he suppressed, showed the antibody in 33 of 65
non-homosexuals. The falsified data was used as the basis for a grant
application to the National Institutes of Health."</span>

for homeless people who were covered by Medicare or Medicaid, who were
then driven to their clinic and paid in exchange to being subjected to
spurious medical procedures.

<p>In 2011 a journal about psychosomatic illnesses published a letter
titled <span class="quote">"Psychosis, Ivermectin Toxicity, and <span

of a man who had earlier thought he was poisoned by the Japanese mafia,
but who then learned about Morgellons disease from the internet, so he
bought ivermectin in bulk from an online veterinary supplier and he
ended up developing ivermectin toxicity:
[<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318211000521>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318211000521</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. A, a 46-year-old Caucasian man, presented to the emergency room
complaining of infestation with parasites, evidenced by cutaneous
sensations of crawling and itching, and seeing <span
class="quote">"cocoons"</span> buried in his skin. <span
class="red">These symptoms began 2 years earlier along with delusions of
being poisoned by the Japanese Mafia.</span> Evaluation by a primary
care physician revealed no signs of infection. He was referred to
psychiatry, but never followed-up. He instead gathered information from
the internet, diagnosed himself with MD, and paid for telephonic
consultation with a MD <span class="quote">"expert"</span> who
prescribed the patient antibiotics and later recommended <span
class="red">ivermectin, which he purchased in bulk from an on-line
veterinary supplier</span>. Mr. A ingested ivermectin daily in unknown
but escalating quantities as cutaneous sensations waxed and waned.</p>
<p>On exam, he displayed slow speech with prolonged latency, an
intention tremor, and ataxia. He was disorganized and sometimes
incoherent, but denied prior medical or psychiatric history, though
urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabinoids. Skin
examination was unremarkable. He was admitted with a <span
class="red">diagnosis of delirium secondary to ivermectin
toxicity</span> that resolved over the course of 2 days with supportive
therapy. Due to persistent paranoia and delusions of infestation,
olanzapine 10 mg/d was started. Although reluctant to forego ivermectin
and take antipsychotic medication, Mr. A consented, and after 1 week
reported reduced skin sensations and delusional conviction. He was
discharged after 10 days with a diagnosis of delusional disorder.</p>
<p>This case adds to an existing literature on the self-diagnosis of MD
facilitated by the internet, where numerous websites provide support,
information, and advice to sufferers of this controversial condition.
The role of the internet in the formation and maintenance of delusional
thinking has led some authors to label MD an <span
class="quote">"internet meme"</span> and <span class="quote">"folie a
internet."</span> Our case highlights the great lengths that patients
may go for symptom relief, and the potential harm associated with
unmonitored <span class="quote">"e-treatment"</span> from purported
experts. This is also the first known report of a patient whose beliefs
about having MD occurred with other clearly psychotic delusions, <span
class="red">suggesting a common etiology or perhaps a greater
susceptibility of individuals with psychosis to <span
class="quote">"internet memes."</span></span></p>

<p>Lee Merritt says that ivermectin cures cancer in vaccinated people,
because vaccines contain parasite eggs, parasites cause cancer, and
ivermectin kills parasites. Lee Merritt's parasite treatment protocol
consists of fenbendazole, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide.

The description of a Rumble video by Lee Merritt said: <span
class="quote">"She shows a short German video about Cancer as a
parasitical infection. Questions Dr Lee Merritt asked herself: Why are
cancers bursting out after the vax? Why does autoimmune disease respond
to anti parasitical? Why do THEY (Fauci &amp; others) hate

<p>The oldest video I found on Odysee that matched the term <span

pathology conference that was uploaded by KLA.tv.
[<a href=https://odysee.com/$/search?q=%22turbo+cancer%22>https://odysee.com/$/search?q=%22turbo+cancer%22</a>]
The same video by KLA.tv was the oldest search result that matched the
term <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span> at BitChute (if you
exclude one video where the title of the video had been edited later to
add the phrase <span class="quote">"turbo cancer"</span>). The video had
an English voiceover which I believe were produced by KLA.tv, because
KLA.tv has also added similar English voiceovers to their original
German-language content.</p>
<p>KLA.tv is a conspiracy video website that is run by members of a cult
called <span class="quote">"Organische Christus-Generation"</span>
(OCG). OCG's leader Ivo Sasek said that the children of OCG members also
help with running KLA.tv but the <span class="quote">"children are

In 2023 when I first did research on KLA.tv, the featured video on the
front page of their website was a film about electroshock therapy by the
Scientologist organization CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights).
[<a href=https://www.kla.tv/en>https://www.kla.tv/en</a>] In 2025 the
featured video discussed an article by Epoch Times about aluminum in
vaccines.</p>
<p>Ivo Sasek also founded an organization called <span
class="quote">"Anti-Zensur-Koalition"</span> (AZK).
[<a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Sasek>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Sasek</a>]
In the first AZK conference in 2009, Sasek did a presentation about the
German New Medicine movement. One speaker at the 2009 AZK conference was
Jürg Stettler, who at the time was the president of the Swiss branch of
the Church of Scientology and the press spokesman for the German branch.
His talk was followed by a screening of CCHR's film <span
class="quote">"Making a Killing: The Untold Story of Psychotropic
Drugging"</span>, which features Rima Laibow and Jim Marrs.
[<a href=https://vimeo.com/channels/809974/videos>https://vimeo.com/channels/809974/videos</a>]
CCHR is an anti-psychiatry organization ran by the Church of
Scientology.</p>
<p>Rima Laibow and General Albert Stubblebine were also speakers at the
2009 AZK conference.
[<a href=https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797>https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797</a>]
In 1989 Rima Laibow founded a center called TREAT (Treatment and
Research of Experienced Anomalous Trauma), which was focused on
psychiatric treatment of alien abduction victims. A German wiki said
that that Laibow <span class="quote">"regularly appears at events
organized by the Scientology offshoots Youth for Human Rights
International and Citizens Commission on Human Rights"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Rima_Laibow>https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Rima_Laibow</a>]
But I don't know if the wiki was correct, because when I asked Laibow if
she was somehow involved with Youth for Human Rights International, she
told me that her involvement with the organization was <span
class="quote">"totally mythical since I never heard of the organization
before I read your comment"</span>.

<p>Another speaker in the 2009 AZK conference was Jane Bürgermeister who
did a presentation about H5N1 vaccines. Bürgermeister's most famous
video is possibly an interview about H5N1 vaccines she did in 2010 with
Bill Ryan from Project Avalon. But Bill Ryan is a Free Zone
Scientologist, and he wrote that with the help of Scientology <span
class="quote">"I opened up my past lives, cleared the backlog of charge
from this-lifetime upsets, and started to develop my suppressed
abilities."</span>

He also wrote: <span class="quote">"The e-meter is a tool, like a
pendulum but far more exact, that assists the auditor in locating areas
of <span class="quote">'available'</span> charge. In itself it does
nothing. The meter is not even necessary, but it does help the auditor
to locate <span class="quote">'stuff'</span> more precisely."</span> And
he wrote: <span class="quote">"As one progresses, cleans more and more
layers of charge off, and rehabilitates lost abilities, one acquires
tools (which in other situations might be called <span
class="quote">'white-magical'</span> or <span
class="quote">'good-shamanic'</span>) which enable one to assist others
remotely at a distance."</span></p>
<p>The speakers at the 2009 AZK conference also included Alexander
Benesch and Nicolas Hofer.
[<a href=https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797>https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797</a>]
Hofer did a presentation about a film by the German Scientologist
Michael Hinz who is also known as Michael Kent.
[<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php?title=Recentr>https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php?title=Recentr</a>]
Benesch and Hofer ran a website called infokrieg.tv which was the German
offshoot of InfoWars. They published German translations of articles by
InfoWars and they sold DVDs by Alex Jones translated to German.</p>
<p>Another speaker at the AZK conference was Hans Tolzin who spoke about
the 2009 swine flu virus. Tolzin was at the time a former Moonie, and in
a forum post in 1998 he wrote that he had been a member of the
Unification Church for 20 years.
[<a href=https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797>https://www.allmystery.de/themen/pr57797</a>]
Hans Tolzin writes for the magazine of the German Scientologist Michael
Kent, whose publishing house distributes Hubbard's books in German.
[<a href=https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Michael_Hinz>https://www.psiram.com/de/index.php/Michael_Hinz</a>]
As of 2024 Tolzin and Kent were working on a film about German New
Medicine, where Kent was the producer and writer of the film and Tolzin
was responsible for fundraising, distribution, and PR.
[<a href=https://besser-leben-film.de/das_neue_filmprojekt>https://besser-leben-film.de/das_neue_filmprojekt</a>]
Their team previously published a film about how the H5N1 virus was
fake.
[<a href=https://besser-leben-film.de/virus>https://besser-leben-film.de/virus</a>]
Kent sells a book about how viruses don't exist, which consists of 32
articles that have been published in his magazine over the years and
that were written by people like himself and Hans Tolzin.
[<a href=https://www.mwbl.de/artikel/virenmaerchen-chronologie-der-fake-seuchen>https://www.mwbl.de/artikel/virenmaerchen-chronologie-der-fake-seuchen</a>]
Tolzin has also ran an anti-vaccination website called impfkritik.de for
over 20 years. In 2020 he announced a reward of 100,000 euros for anyone
who could prove the existence of SARS-CoV-2.

<p>In 2010 Alexander Benesch from InfoKrieg was a speaker at a
conference in the United States that was organized by Rima Laibow and
Albert Stubblebine.

Stubblebine was the commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence and
Security Command, and he was also the head of the US Army's remote
viewing program (but many of the stars of the remote viewing program
were Scientologists, including Ingo Swann, Russel Targ, Hal Puthoff, Pat
Price, and Edwin May).

One of the headline speakers at Laibow and Stubblebine's conference was
Kevin Trudeau, who wrote that he has studied various religions but that
<span class="quote">"I happen to think for myself, personally, that
Scientology auditing, as well as the courses that they offer, have been
