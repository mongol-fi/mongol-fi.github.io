</h2>
<p>In March 2024, Martin Neil, Norman Fenton, and Scott McLachlan published a preprint titled <span class="quote">"The extent and impact of vaccine status miscategorisation on covid-19 vaccine efficacy studies"</span>. [<a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.09.24304015v1.full.pdf>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.09.24304015v1.full.pdf</a>] The abstract said: <span class="quote">"Systematic review identified thirty-nine studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy. Given this, any claims of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy based on these studies are likely to be a statistical illusion."</span></p>
<p>Note how they relied on a simulation to demonstrate that the cheap trick would increase vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>The methodology they used to do the simulations was poorly described, because for example they didn't mention that they only applied the cheap trick to the numerator but not to the denominator, and they didn't explain which number of new vaccine doses they simulated on each day or week of the simulation. And they didn't even explain why unvaccinated people only had one line in their plots, even though there should've been three different lines that would've corresponded to the three lines for vaccinated people. And at first I even thought that the weeks in their simulation were weeks since vaccination, but actually they were weeks of the simulation instead. This shows the results of the simulation:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>For example in scenario A, the vaccine was supposed to be a placebo which had no effect on the infection rate, and all people had a 1% constant infection rate regardless of whether they were vaccinated or not. So I thought that even if people would be classified as unvaccinated for the first 1 to 3 weeks after vaccination, both unvaccinated and vaccinated people should still have a constant infection rate of 1%. But I only understood how the model worked after Uncle John Returns posted this tweet: [<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1770085722550133215>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1770085722550133215</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've simulated Fenton's simulation. I've only shown the 1 week unvaccinated line (to hit 1% in week 7). You can get almost any shape you like by adjusting the vaccinations per week. Curves smoothed by Excel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I reproduced Uncle John's plot, but I didn't add the smoothing, and I also added lines for unvaccinated people in the scenarios where people were considered as unvaccinated for 2 or 3 weeks after vaccination:</p>

<p>Later I found out that in 2023 Neil and Fenton had published a Substack post where they described their simulation procedure in more detail. And they even included a table similar to the table that Uncle John made, which made it clear that they only applied the cheap trick to the numerator but not to the denominator: [<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-illusion-of-vaccine-efficacy>https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-illusion-of-vaccine-efficacy</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim-5.png width=1100>
</div>
<p>They could've also included a similar table in their new preprint to make their methodology more clear.</p>
<p>People in Substack comments rarely address any specific details related to the topic of the post, and even if the author makes some obvious error, it's rare for people in the comments to mention it (or if they do then they just get banned like me). But this time several people in the comment section were wondering why the cheap trick was not also applied to the denominator in the models, and people were asking Neil and Fenton to cite any actual study which would've worked like their models so that the cheap trick was only applied to the numerator but not the denominator:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim-6.jpg width=1300>
</div>
<p>Neil and Fenton failed to cite any actual study which would've worked like their simulation, but they responded to the Substack comments by adding this note to their Substack post: <span class="quote">"<strong><em>6 May 2023</em></strong> Update: Quite a few people have asked why we are including those vaccinated within the last 21 days in the <span class="quote">'total vaccinated'</span> denominator for the vaccinated infection rate if such people are classified as unvaccinated. The answer is that, while those infected within 21 days are classified as unvaccined in observational trials, those who are not infected are generally treated as vaccinated. In observational studies, which is what we are simulating here, there is no pre-defined vaccine and control group as there would be in a controlled trial. And, unlike a controlled trial, people are getting vaccinated at different times. Hence, everything is driven by looking at <span class="quote">'cases'</span> i.e. those defined to have been infected in any given week; all those infected within 21 days of a vaccination are classified as unvaccinated. However, for the efficacy calculation at any time, for the <span class="quote">'denominators'</span> they simply use the total number of people vaccinated so far (e.g. from NIMS) and for this, there is generally no <span class="quote">'21 day delay'</span>."</span> However they didn't cite any source for their claim that there was generally no 21-day delay applied to the denominator.</p>
<p>Even though YouTube comments are not generally posted by the sharpest kind of people, even people in Fenton's YouTube comments were saying that his simulation was fishy: [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N-ZL3_k>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N-ZL3_k</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/neil-sim-7.png width=1200>
</div>
<p>In the old Substack post where Fenton and Neil described their simulation procedure in more detail, even people in their comment section were able to tell that it was BS, so I wonder if that's why they didn't include a proper description of their simulation procedure in their new preprint.</p>
<p>In any case Neil and Fenton knew that their method of doing the simulations was controversial, so they could've mentioned in their preprint that there would've also been an alternative way to perform the simulations where the 1-to-3-week delay was also applied to the denominator, and that they were not sure which method was used in the real studies they listed in their paper.</p>
<p>Added later: Peter Hegarty went through the 39 studies listed in the cheap trick paper with a fine-toothed comb, and he wrote: <span class="quote">"Moreover, their text and simulations suggest they were concerned with an even much more egregious form of the bias, whereby only Covid cases amongst the partially vaccinated contributed to the infection rate for the unvaccinated. In other words, partially vaccinated cases were counted in the numerator of the infection rate for the unvaccinated, but partially vaccinated individuals were counted in the denominator for the fully vaccinated. We can state categorically that we found no evidence in any of the 39 studies of this <span class="quote">'trick'</span> being employed."</span> [<a href=https://researchgate.net/publication/387220055_A_DETAILED_ANALYSIS_OF_CLAIMS_OF_MISCATEGORIZATION_BIAS_IN_STUDIES_OF_COVID-19_VACCINE_EFFECTIVENESS>https://researchgate.net/publication/387220055_A_DETAILED_ANALYSIS_OF_CLAIMS_OF_MISCATEGORIZATION_BIAS_IN_STUDIES_OF_COVID-19_VACCINE_EFFECTIVENESS</a>]</p>
<p>He wrote the following summary of his findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a summary of our findings for the 39 papers on NFMs list:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 of the items are the same, thus there are 38 different items.</li>
<li>1 item is a meta-analysis and 1 is not a VE study at all. We omit both from consideration.</li>
<li>NFM claim that each of the remaining 36 items has Miscategorization bias. We found that only 10 items had such bias. Indeed, 8 items were RCTs, for which such bias doesn't even make sense.</li>
<li>In addition, 1 item had a type of miscategorization bias not covered by NFMs definition, but it affected a tiny proportion of the cohort and was not significant.</li>
<li>NFM claimed that only 2 items had Exclusion bias. In fact, 28 items had this bias in their primary analysis and it was by far the most common form of statistical bias. - Of the 28 items with Exclusion bias, 7 had secondary analyses which corrected for it more or less in full, while 3 more corrected for it in part. In all 10 cases, corrected VE remained significant.</li>
<li>In a further 2 items with Exclusion bias and 1 with Miscategorization bias, it was clear that the bias affected too small a proportion of the cohort to be significant.</li>
<li>1 item had none of the biases defined by NFM at all.</li>
<li>NFM claimed that 4 items had Unverified bias, whereas we found only 1 item definitely had that bias, and for 1 other item we were not sure.</li>
<li>NFM claimed that 5 items had Uncontrolled bias, but we found no item with that bias.</li>
<li>NFM claimed that 2 items had Undefined bias, but we found no item with that bias.</li>
<li>Overall, we found that NFM correctly assigned categories of bias to only 6 out of 39 items (#3, 7, 28, 34, 36, 39).</li>
<li>Of the 22 items with either Miscategorization or Exclusion bias which could not be corrected for from the data provided in the study, only 1 gave a clear suggestion of negative VE in the period soon after a first vaccination. But VE was already modest in this study for fully vaccinated individuals, and the vaccine involved was SpikoGen, a non- mRNA vaccine deployed outside of Western countries. Of the 29 studies mainly focused on mRNA vaccines, 1 had evidence for negative VE, even for fully vaccinated individuals, against Covid-19 infection but not against more severe outcomes. Otherwise, there was scant evidence that, in NFMs words, <span class="quote">"any claims of vaccine efficacy are likely to be a statistical illusion"</span> resulting from the biases they defined.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Added in February 2025: Neil and Fenton now wrote that when they tried to submit their cheap trick paper to a journal, it didn't pass peer review. [<a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/dirty-deeds-done-dirt-cheap>https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/dirty-deeds-done-dirt-cheap</a>] They published a list of comments written by one of their reviewers, who didn't seem to initially understand that the classification delay was only applied to the numerator in the simulations, because the reviewer wrote: <span class="quote">"Can you explain why in Figure 1, Panel A, the infection rate would increase for the unvaccinated in week 2? The unvaccinated group is composed of vaccinated people and unvaccinated people because of the delay but both groups have been assigned an infection rate of 1% right? And why is the rate for the unvaccinated group consistent across time regardless of the amount of delay used?"</span> The reviewer also wrote: <span class="quote">"Do you have a citation for the statement that miscategorisation selection biases inevitably exaggerate vaccine efficacy? I would expect nondifferential exposure misclassification to move the effect estimate towards the null while differential exposure misclassification could bias the estimate in any direction. See Rothman, page 137."</span> Like me, the reviewer also pointed out that the methodology of the simulations was not described in a detailed enough way: <span class="quote">"I'd like more information on the simulation methods. For example, how are you calculating vaccine effectiveness? And how do you treat the infected population - do they recover, are they eligible for reinfection?"</span> Then Neil and Fenton wrote that they added a supplementary file to their paper which described the methodology of their simulations more clearly, so now the same reviewer wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing the supplementary materials - this clarifies your simulation methods and explains your results. Unfortunately, you have made a major error in your simulation design.</p>
<p>Using Scenario A, Case 1 as an example, in week 2, you calculate the infection rate among the vaccinated as Cases in fully vaccinated (&gt;1 week) divided by Cumulative ever vaccinated (i.e., 100/210,000). The denominator of this calculation is incorrect since the 200,000 newly vaccinated individuals in week 2 should not count as vaccinated people - their outcomes are attributed to the unvaccinated population so they should also be part of the unvaccinated population, in accordance with both fundamental study design principles and as stated in the specific study design decision that is the topic of this paper. The correct calculation for the vaccinated rate in week 2 is Cases in fully vaccinated (&gt;1 week) divided by Total fully vaccinated (&gt;1 week) which is 100/10,000 resulting in a rate of 1%, which is consistent with your simulation specifications. This also corrects the calculations for the unvaccinated population - you currently do (new cases + cases in newly vaccinated)/Total unvaccinated when the correct calculation is (new cases + cases in newly vaccinated)/(Total unvaccinated + Newly vaccinated). This corrected calculation is (7900+2000)/(790000+200000) resulting in a rate of 1%, which is again consistent with your simulation specifications. Notably, with a rate of 1% in both your vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, this reproduces a vaccine effectiveness of no effect as intended by your simulation. This mistake is also seen in the other scenarios.</p>
<p>In making this mistake, your simulation diverges from the study design decision that you claim introduces bias - when researchers delay assigning individuals to the vaccinated group for 14 days after a vaccination, they assign both any outcomes that occur and these people's follow-up time to the unvaccinated group until 14 days have passed. Your simulations do not recreate this scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I posted this comment to Neil and Fenton at Substack (but they blocked me and deleted my comment):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I now read the updated version of your paper.</p>
<p>1. Your abstract still says: <span class="quote">"Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy."</span> You could've specified that you referred to the form of miscategorization that is only applied to the numerator, but that you're not sure if the numerator-only form of miscategorization was employed in the papers you listed.</p>
<p>2. You also wrote: <span class="quote">"This bias, which has been seen to take several different types, all of which help exaggerate vaccine efficacy, has recently become known colloquially as the <span class="quote">'cheap trick'</span> (Fenton &amp; Neil, 2023)."</span></p>
<p>However if vaccine manufacturers state that the vaccine is not yet designed to be fully effective immediately after vaccination or only after a single dose, then I don't think it exaggerates the stated efficacy of the vaccine if the efficacy is only measured starting from two or three weeks after the second dose.</p>
<p>And also I don't think all types of the bias would necessarily exaggerate efficacy like you claimed. In your first simulation where you assumed a constant infection rate and you assumed that vaccines have zero efficacy, if you also apply the classification delay to the numerator, then both unvaccinated and vaccinated people have a constant 1% reported infection rate, so the reported vaccine efficacy is zero which is the same as the actual efficacy in your simulation.</p>
<p>3. You also wrote: <span class="quote">"We focus explicitly on miscategorisation biases, which in the Covid-19 studies cited have inevitably exaggerated vaccine efficacy."</span> I would be more wary of using words like <span class="quote">"inevitably"</span>. If the miscategorization bias is also applied to the denominator, then it does not inevitably exaggerate vaccine efficacy. If for example there was a study where there was a low incidence of COVID during the first half of the observation period and a high incidence of COVID during the second half, and where the risk ratio of vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people would not be adjusted for the amount of observation time during different periods, then the misclassification might end up underestimating vaccine efficacy because it would reduce the amount of vaccinated observation time during the low-COVID period and it would increase the amount of unvaccinated observation time during the low-COVID period.</p>
<p>4. You wrote: <span class="quote">"The later method (denominators unadjusted) is the convention, and our results are calculated using that method."</span> But you should've provided a more detailed description of why you claim it is the convention.</p>
<p>5. You also wrote: <span class="quote">"In practice, most studies do not report vaccine efficacy in the initial week(s) (when no cases are categorised as vaccinated) as this would show up as 100% efficacy."</span> But you should've specified that your statement was dependent on the assumption that the cheap trick was only applied to the numerator.</p>

</h2>
<p>The 9th and final version of the ONS dataset for deaths by vaccination status was published in August 2023. It included data up to May 2023, but the reason why June and July were excluded from the release was probably because they were still missing too many deaths because of a registration delay. In May it looked like the trend was that the unvaccinated ASMR was soon about to cross below the ever vaccinated ASMR: [<a href=https://twitter.com/mothrfunkr/status/1774625071140893040>https://twitter.com/mothrfunkr/status/1774625071140893040</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However I think it's because younger people are more likely to be unvaccinated than older people, and the registration delay for deaths is longer in younger people, so during the last months with data available there's a larger percentage of deaths missing in younger people, which introduces a bias where it reduces unvaccinated ASMR more than vaccinated ASMR.</p>
<p>Similarly in the July 2022 release of the ONS dataset, the last month of data included was May 2022 when unvaccinated people had only about 6% higher ASMR than vaccinated people, and it looked like the trend was that unvaccinated ASMR was soon about to cross below vaccinated ASMR. But in the next release after more missing deaths were added, the unvaccinated ASMR in May 2022 became about 22% higher than vaccinated ASMR:</p>

<p>In the year 2021 in an ONS dataset titled <span class="quote">"Impact of registration delays on mortality statistics"</span>, the proportion of deaths which had a registration delay of 3 months or longer was about 12% in ages 45-64 but only about 2% in ages 85 and over: [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatisticsinenglandandwales/2021>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatisticsinenglandandwales/2021</a>]</p>

</h2>
<p>In February 2024 the UK ONS announced that they had changed the methodology they used to calculate excess mortality. [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024</a>]</p>
<p>Previously they used a simple 5-year average where the year 2020 was excluded but the years 2021-2023 were not, so for example the baseline for the year 2023 was based on the years 2017-2019 and 2021-2022. However now they simply excluded a hardcoded set of months when COVID was listed as the underlying cause of death for at least 15% of all deaths, which were April and May 2020 and November 2020 to February 2021 (or weeks 14-22 of 2020 and week 45 of 2020 to week 8 of 2021 for weekly data).</p>
<p>A lot of people were saying that the new method inflated excess deaths because 2020 and later years were included in the fitting period of the baseline, but people didn't realize that the old method also included the years 2021-2023. The old 5-year average underestimated excess deaths because UK has an increasing trend in deaths because of the aging population, but the old method overestimated excess deaths relative to the prepandemic trend because 2021-2023 were included in the baseline fitting period. So the old method was inaccurate in two ways, which ended up partially canceling each other out starting from the year 2022 when 2021 started to be included in the baseline fitting period.</p>

<p>The consequence of the crazy estimate their new model spits out is that a total of 110,000 more deaths were <span class="quote">"expected"</span> from 2016-2019 compared to their old model. It also means that 2019 went from having an excess of 3k deaths to a deficit of 36k. If 36,000 people who were <span class="quote">"expected"</span> to die in 2019 did not have their deaths registered, then surely that paints the excess in registrations in 2020 in a different light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However UK has an increasing trend in deaths per year because of the aging population, so in the years 2012 to 2019, the number of deaths was always above the average of the past five years. But a linear trend of the past five years was a better approximation of actual deaths, because the 5-year average was lagging 3 years behind the trend:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/covidstat-onsbase-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The ONS article about the new baseline methodology was accompanied by a spreadsheet which shows monthly and weekly deaths in the years 2005 to 2023 by age, region, and sex. In the code below I calculated the yearly sum of deaths in England and Wales based on Table 2 of the spreadsheet. When I used the average of the five previous years as the baseline for each year, there was a total of 68,840 excess deaths in 2016 to 2019. But when I used a linear trend of the five previous years as the baseline for each year, there's a total of -29,476 excess deaths in 2016 to 2019 instead. So difference is about 100,000 deaths, which is similar to the difference between the new and old ONS method that was mentioned by Craig:</p>

<p>Craig also pointed out that the new ONS method produced a similar expected number of deaths for 2020, 2021, and 2022: [<a href=https://twitter.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1778336819270074865>https://twitter.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1778336819270074865</a>]</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The new method uses a 5-year trend calculated with a quasi-Poisson regression. There was a big drop in the baseline between 2019 and 2020, because the baseline for the year 2020 was based on the years 2015-2019, and there was a low number of deaths in 2019 and a high number of deaths in 2015, so the slope of the trend was too low. The slope of a 2015-2019 linear trend is also too flat relative to the actual long-term trend. OWID also uses a 2015-2019 linear trend for all countries, so it overestimates excess deaths in countries that had a low number of deaths in 2019, like UK and Sweden.</p>
<p>In the plot below, I think my green baseline is more accurate than the new method used by the ONS. I first calculated a linear trend in crude mortality rate within each 5-year age group in 2010-2019. Then I multiplied the projected trend by the population size of the age group to get the expected number of deaths for the age group, and I added together the expected number of deaths for all age groups to get the total expected deaths for a year. I used a fairly long fitting period for the baseline, so anomalous years like 2019 have less impact on my baseline than in the new ONS method. But compared to my green baseline, the new ONS baseline actually seems far too low in the years 2021 and 2022:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/covidstat-onsbase-4.png width=600>
</div>
<p>People were speculating that ONS adopted the new method of calculating the baseline in order to diminish the number of excess deaths caused by the vaccines. But my plot above shows that the new ONS baseline is likely far too low in the years 2021 and 2022, which would mean that it actually exaggerates excess deaths during the years when the most vaccines were given.</p>

      The green baseline was calculated by first taking the linear trend in CMR by five-year age groups in 2010-2019, and then the projected trend was multiplied by the population size of each age group to get the expected deaths, and the expected deaths for each age group were added together to get the yearly total expected deaths.
      The gray baseline is a simple average of the past five years with 2020 excluded, so for example the baseline for 2023 consists of the years 2017-2019 and 2021-2022.&quot;

<p>Craig also wrote: <span class="quote">"However, you can't hide the truth forever. All that is needed is the calculation of an age-standardised mortality rate. This is a way of mapping mortality from a real population to one that has a standard age structure so different regions can be fairly compared with each other and across time. Using that methodology it is impossible to hide the issue of excess mortality."</span> In the code below I calculated ASMR for England and Wales using the spreadsheet that accompanied the methodology article by the ONS. I used the 2020 population as the standard population, and I used the 2005-2019 second-degree polynomial trend in ASMR as the baseline, which gave me only about 0.12% excess ASMR in the years 2016-2019 (so it's closer to the new ONS baseline than to the old ONS baseline):</p>

<p>At first I thought that the regression above was based on raw number of deaths and not mortality rates, but the methodology article says that when the population size is included as an offset variable, it's analogous to doing the regression on mortality rates: <span class="quote">"When using a quasi-Poisson regression model, modelling the number of deaths as the dependent variable, and including the natural logarithm of population size as an offset term is analogous to modelling the mortality rate in each age-sex-geography stratum."</span> [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024</a>]</p>
<p>ONS is not the only organization which has switched away from using a simple average baseline. OWID previously also used a 2015-2019 average to calculate excess deaths, but they later switched to a 2015-2019 linear trend which is usually more accurate. OWID's website says: <span class="quote">"Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019. We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation - it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality. The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it accounts for these year-to-year trends."</span> [<a href=https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid>https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid</a>]</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics previously used a 2015-2019 average to calculate excess deaths during COVID, but in 2023 they switched to a more sophisticated cyclical linear regression method which reduced the excess deaths during COVID, because Australia has an increasing trend in deaths per year similar to most OECD countries. [<a href=https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/measuring-australias-excess-mortality-during-covid-19-pandemic-until-august-2023>https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/measuring-australias-excess-mortality-during-covid-19-pandemic-until-august-2023</a>]</p>
<p>TheRustler83 has been tweeting about how the ONS adopted the new method to calculate the baseline because they were trying to hide excess deaths caused by vaccines. I posted the plot for ASMR in England and Wales below to to demonstrate to him that when I used a 2015-2019 average baseline, I got negative total excess ASMR in 2024, and I got much lower excess mortality in the post-vaccination era compared to a 2015-2019 linear trend. But I guess in the case of ASMR he would not be in favor of using an average baseline instead of a linear trend, because there was a decreasing trend in ASMR before COVID so the average baseline would reduce the number of excess deaths in the post-vaccine era:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/covidstat-onsbase-7.png width=600>
</div>
<p>OHID also uses a quasi-Poisson regression to calculate the baseline in their dataset for excess deaths in England: [<a href=https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/documents/EMMethodology.pdf>https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/documents/EMMethodology.pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted on the logarithmic scale [reference 13]. Quasi-Poisson models were used because when counts of weekly deaths are independent of one another they theoretically follow a Poisson distribution. This has the characteristic property that as its mean (the expected number of deaths) increases, the variability of the observed count of deaths (its variance) rises in parallel such that the variance always equals the mean.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, the underlying risk of death varies between different population subgroups and as this cannot usually be modelled perfectly, observed counts of deaths are not completely independent. In consequence, the variance then increases faster than the mean and this is referred to as <span class="quote">"overdispersion"</span>. Because Quasi-Poisson models allow the linear relationship between variance and mean to have a slope other than unity, they appropriately analyse rates of death when overdispersion exists.</p>
<p>The models contained the set of covariates outlined in the <span class="quote">'Data structure and covariates'</span> section above. To allow for effects to vary between groups, interaction terms were added between age and sex, age and deprivation, age and time of year, age and ethnicity and ethnicity and deprivation. Population sizes in each subgroup are accounted for in the model as an offset.</p>
<p>The model generates expected death rates for each population subgroup for each week, which are then applied to relevant population estimates to estimate the expected numbers of deaths for each week in each subgroup.</p>

<a href=#canceledmouse_Neonatal_deaths_in_Scotland id=canceledmouse_Neonatal_deaths_in_Scotland>canceledmouse: Neonatal deaths in Scotland</a>
</h2>
<p>canceledmouse posted this plot of neonatal deaths in Scotland, and he suggested that the spikes in deaths in September 2021 and March 2022 might have been caused by the vaccines: [<a href=https://twitter.com/canceledmouse/status/1782970982367371664>https://twitter.com/canceledmouse/status/1782970982367371664</a>, <a href=https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/>https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However the data has so much noise that I don't know if the spikes in deaths can be blamed on the vaccines. His plot only showed data up to June 2023, so you weren't able to see that there was a third spike in neonatal deaths in July 2023. And also stillbirths and postneonatal deaths peaked during completely different months than neonatal deaths. Stillbirths peaked in July 2020 and April 2023 which is difficult to blame on the vaccines, and postneonatal deaths peaked in September 2020 and April 2023:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-scotlandinfant-2.png width=700>
</div>
<p>Eurostat only had yearly data for infant mortality, but when I selected countries that had a neonatal mortality rate available for each year out of 2010-2022, the average mortality rate actually decreased from about 24 deaths per 10,000 live births in 2020 to about 22 in 2021 (even though it would probably be better to calculate total neonatal deaths across all countries divided by total live births across all countries, so then small countries like Luxembourg with a lot of noise wouldn't be given that much weight, or I could've used a weighted average by population size instead of a regular average): [<a href=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database>https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database</a>]</p>

<p>The new version of the Scottish dashboard now shows quarterly data, but the rate of neonatal deaths was lower in July to September 2021 than in two other quarters: [<a href=https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-pregnancy-births-neonatal/>https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-pregnancy-births-neonatal/</a>]</p>

<p>Her blue line shows the 9th August 2023 edition of the ONS data and the green line shows the 7th July 2022 edition, so there's a gap of over a year between the editions. So therefore a lot of deaths that were missing because of a registration delay in the 7th edition have been added to the 9th edition:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-vs-ons-2.png width=600>

<p>The 3rd edition was similarly missing a lot of deaths that had been added by the 7th edition even though there was a shorter time gap between the editions. (I didn't include the first two editions in the plot above, because they showed weekly instead of monthly data.)</p>
<p>For some reason the new FOI response has a higher number of deaths in January 2022 than December 2021, even though in the ONS dataset it's the reverse. I thought it might be if the FOI response was by registration date, but that doesn't seem to be the case:</p>

<p>For some reason in April 2021 the 9th edition has less deaths in ages 90+ than the 7th edition. So were some old people linked to the 2011 census but not the 2021 census? However the population size of ages 90+ is higher in the 9th edition than the 7th edition.</p>

<a href=#Were_dying_people_vaccinated_on_their_deathbed id=Were_dying_people_vaccinated_on_their_deathbed>Were dying people vaccinated on their deathbed?</a>
</h3>
<p>As an explanation why almost all deaths were in vaccinated people in late 2022, Craig suggested that dying people who were previously unvaccinated were vaccinated on their deathbed: [<a href=https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1795770648721240528>https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1795770648721240528</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has become almost impossible to die in this country without first being injected.</p>
<p>No longer is the priest by the bed side reading last rites, it's the vaccinator.</p>
<p>I will explain below.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-deathbed-1.png width=500>
</div>
<p>The graph shows the percentage of adult deaths in England that were vaccinated <a href=https://whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_in_nims_database#incoming-2653782>https://whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_in_nims_database#incoming-2653782</a></p>

<p>From 2022, there were more covid deaths in the vaccinated with omicron - but I don't think that is what accounts for this.</p>
<p>This is all cause deaths - which had settled into a predictable pattern in summer 2021.</p>
<p>Even if the vaccinated died more, the unvaccinated should still be dying!</p>
<p>How can there be half the deaths in the unvaccinated in July 2022 compared to July 2021?</p>
<p>By Autumn it was only a quarter.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-deathbed-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In summer 2021 the unvaccinated seem to have been left alone.</p>
<p>But in 2022, as well as the vaccinated dying more, it looks like those susceptible to death had been injected before dying.</p>
<p>Same as first graph with zoomed in y-axis showing percentage of deaths in vaccinated.</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-deathbed-4.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Vaccinating the dying makes interpretation of any data on deaths almost impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought that Craig's Twitter thread might have been tongue-in-cheek and she actually meant that there was some anomaly in the data she described and not that unvaccinated people who were soon about to die were actually being vaccinated. Someone else seems to have had the same impression, because they posted this reply to the thread: <span class="quote">"Sorry, Clare, I find all that info very hard to take in, but are you saying that if you go to die in hospital, at any age, from any causes, they will vaccinate you? Or are you saying they are fiddling the figures?"</span> However Craig indicated that she was being serious: <span class="quote">"I think the former. Unless you die suddenly, I think there's huge pressure still to be injected."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1795954376751632471>https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1795954376751632471</a>]</p>
<p>However her theory doesn't hold water, because according to the new FOI response there were 269,247 people who died in the second half of 2022, but among them only 193 people had received the first vaccine dose on a week that started in the second half of 2022:</p>

sum(t$Record.Count) # 269247
sum(t$Record.Count[t$Dose.Date%in%d1:d2]) # 193</pre>
<p>The reason why some of Craig's plots showed that nearly 100% of deaths were in vaccinated people in late 2022 was because she took the monthly number of deaths in vaccinated people from the new FOI response which was released in May 2024, but she took the number of deaths in the general population of England from an old ONS user request which was released in July 2023. The deaths in the ONS user request are by date of occurrence and not by registration date, so it has a fairly large number of deaths missing because of a registration delay, and the proportion of missing deaths is particularly high in late 2022 and in younger age groups. [<a href=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_in_nims_database#incoming-2653782>https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_in_nims_database#incoming-2653782</a>, <a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/1343dailydeathsbydateofoccurrence1stjune2014to31stmay2023bysingleyearofageengland>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/1343dailydeathsbydateofoccurrence1stjune2014to31stmay2023bysingleyearofageengland</a>] In the first plot below I took the number of deaths among the general English population from the same ONS user response that Craig used. But in the second plot I used a more recent dataset which was not missing as many deaths as the old ONS user reponse, so I got a much lower percentage of deaths in vaccinated people:</p>

      The dataset for deaths by date of occurrence is missing many deaths in 2023 and 2022 because of a registration delay, and the proportion of missing deaths is particularly high in younger age groups in 2023. The dataset for deaths by registration date seems to be missing many deaths in December 2022, which might be if there was a delay registering deaths during the holidays.
      In the FOI response the age of each person is the age at the date of first vaccination, which might explain why for example the 70-74 age group has over 100% deaths in 2023 and 2022, because by 2023 it includes people who were up to 77 years old when they died.&quot;)

<p>Clare Craig posted plots which showed that people vaccinated during the rollout peak subsequently had a low mortality rate up to the end of 2021, but people vaccinated either before or after the rollout peak had a higher mortality rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same pattern is seen in older age groups.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Targeting of the dying in spring 2021, with a high proportion dead by the end of the year</li>
<li>Rollout to the healthy with a low proportion who then die</li>
<li>Targeting the dying again, perhaps pressuring those declined vaccinations if they then become ill or are admitted to hospital</li>
</ol>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<img src=i/uk-three-phase.png width=500>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig said that in during the third phase in the second half of 2021, <span class="quote">"the dying"</span> were targeted again because the mortality rate was higher than during the second phase. However I don't know if people who were soon about to die were even overrepresented among the people who were vaccinated in the third phase, because the plot below shows that the mortality rate of people vaccinated in the second half of 2021 is close to the baseline in most age groups (except it's below the baseline in youngest age groups and maybe a bit above it in the two oldest age groups, but on the other hand I didn't account for aging of people over time when I calculated the baseline, so the baseline is too low particularly in the two oldest age groups, because by the end of 2022 for example the age group 70-79 includes people who are up to 81 years old):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-three-phase-2.png width=800>
</div>
<p>In the plot above ages 80+ are far above the baseline from February to April 2021, but it could be if people from the upper end of the age group were overrepresented among vaccinated people. One limitation of the FOI response is that it only has one broad age group for ages 80 and above.</p>

<p>Well, apart from the fact that the deaths are in the wrong place, preventing any meaningful analysis, the missing deaths (the ones that are actually meaningful because they were unusual enough to warrant extra attention of the coroner), actually make a difference!</p>
<p>Case in point, here, courtesy of <a href=https://x.com/henjin256/status/1796095247501467862/photo/1>henjin256</a>, are the updates to the ONS bulletin on COVID vaccine mortality:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-vs-ons-2.png width=600>
</div>
<p>You see how many more deaths there really were in the vaccinated (black line resulting for Clare Craig's FOI request) compared to their original bulletin in Dec 2021 (green line) that was seized upon by the MSM to vilify all the dirty unvaccinated?</p>
<p>What a difference three years makes, eh? And we only know because of Clare's diligence. Left to their own devices, the ONS wouldn't have bothered with any further updates.</p>
<p>How much difference? Completely turns it on its head, that's what! You go from a <a href=https://metatron.substack.com/p/cooking-the-books-ons-style>spurious positive vaccine effectiveness</a> to a <a href=https://metatron.substack.com/p/debunking-the-lie-that-covid-vaccines>negative one</a> because, ultimately, there are thousands more deaths reported in the vaccinated (numerator) but the vaccinated population (denominator) hasn't changed [1].</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>1. In this case, the numerator is the proportion of deaths that are in the vaccinated and the denominator is the proportion of population that is vaccinated. Both numerator and denominator of deaths will increase as new mortality data is received but it is evidently disproportionately in the vaccinated. That alone is a story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the numerator in my plot was the absolute number of deaths in vaccinated people, and not the proportion of deaths. And the denominator did in fact change, because the black line includes deaths among the general resident population of England, but the colored lines which show data from the ONS dataset only include the subset of the English population that is linked in the ONS dataset.</p>
<p>The bulletin for the 9th release of the ONS dataset said: <span class="quote">"The 2021 Census linked dataset is based on the population in Census 2021. This allows for analyses to be carried out that require a known living population with known characteristics. We linked deidentified Census 2021 records to NHS numbers using the personal demographics service to obtain NHS numbers for census identifiers.

</h3>
<p>Joel Smalley posted this plot where vaccinated people in ages 20-29 got high excess deaths relative to his baseline: [<a href=https://metatron.substack.com/p/debunking-the-lie-that-covid-vaccines>https://metatron.substack.com/p/debunking-the-lie-that-covid-vaccines</a>]</p>

<p>Smalley is supposed to have calculated the expected deaths by multiplying the total deaths in England with the percentage of vaccinated people in England. However his percentage of vaccinated people was too low, because he accidentally calculated it by dividing the number of vaccinated people in England with the population estimate in the whole UK (and he also used ages 18-29 to calculate the percentage of vaccinated people in ages 20-29, even though it probably doesn't make much difference here): [<a href=https://ln5.sync.com/dl/321e94000/pn8agafm-g5mvaahq-yqrqkatg-8bht5qcs/view/doc/22875650440011>https://ln5.sync.com/dl/321e94000/pn8agafm-g5mvaahq-yqrqkatg-8bht5qcs/view/doc/22875650440011</a>]</p>

<p>His population size for ages 20-29 was about 42% bigger than the mid-2021 resident population estimate of ages 20-29 in England:</p>

<p>However his population size for ages 20-29 was only about 2% higher than the mid-2021 resident population estimate of ages 18-29 in the whole UK.

<p>The number of people aged 18-29 in England with one or more vaccine dose on June 17th 2022 was 6,831,316 in a spreadsheet published by the ONS, and it 6,823,279 in Smalley's spreadsheet, so the figures were close to the same. [<a href=https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/COVID-19-daily-announced-vaccinations-18-June-2022-1.xlsx>https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/COVID-19-daily-announced-vaccinations-18-June-2022-1.xlsx</a>] So Smalley seems to have divided the number of vaccinated people in England with the population size in the whole UK.</p>
<p>Another reason why Smalley's baseline was too low was that he took the deaths in England from his old ONS user request published in November 2022, where ages 20-29 were still missing a lot of deaths in 2021 due to a registration delay.

<p>In the next plot I used the same numbers as Smalley for the number of vaccinated people in ages 18-29, but I divided it with the resident population estimate of ages 18-29 in England instead of UK to calculate the percentage of vaccinated people. And I took the total deaths in England from Smalley's updated July 2023 user request and not the old user request from November 2022. Now my corrected baseline was below the number of deaths in vaccinated people during each of the last 5 months of 2021. In earlier months of 2021 the baseline was below actual deaths which may have been because vulnerable groups of people had been priorized for vaccination. And in 2022 the baseline fell below actual deaths because even the newer ONS user response was still missing a lot of deaths due to a registration delay in 2022:</p>

<p>At first I thought that maybe there was some kind of a change to the definitions of the different categories around mid-2021, because the number of category 3 incidents went down around the same time when the number of category 1 incidents went up, but the total number of incidents remained roughly flat. So I thought that maybe there was some kind of a change in policy, so that for example a part of category 3 incidents were shifted to category 2 and a part of category 2 incidents were shifted to category 1: [<a href=https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-indicators/>https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-indicators/</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>However I didn't find any source which would've mentioned that there was any change in policy around mid-2021. For example a report published in August 2021 said that there had been an increase in category 1 incidents, but it didn't mention that the increase would've been because of any kind of a policy change: <span class="quote">"The latest month's activity figures continue to highlight the intense pressure the ambulance service is facing. In June 2021, ambulance category one incidents increased by 8.1% since the previous month to 73,505 (5,523 more incidents). In comparison to a year ago, category one incidents have increased significantly by 62% (28,144 more incidents than June 2020). Compared to two years ago, before the pandemic, this is an increase of 27.2% (15,714 more incidents than June 2019) and overall activity has increased by 11.3%."</span> [<a href=https://nhsproviders.org/rapid-response/introduction>https://nhsproviders.org/rapid-response/introduction</a>]</p>
<p>As an alternative explanation for why category 3 incidents went down around the same time when category 1 incidents went up, an increase in category 1 incidents might have meant that ambulance services no longer had enough resources to respond to all category 3 incidents, so they may have needed to adapt a more agressive triage policy that reduced the number of category 3 incidents they needed to respond to.</p>

<p>However the mortality rate of people under the second dose shoots up when the healthy vaccinees get the third dose and the unhealthy stragglers remain under the second dose.</p>
<p>For example in the plot below which shows CMR for ages 80-89 from table 2 of the ONS spreadsheet, October 2021 is the first month when a large number of people are included under the third dose, but in October 2021 people with three doses have about -65% excess mortality relative to the general population of England. As the negative excess mortality of people under the third dose gradually gets closer to zero, the positive excess mortality of people with two doses also returns closer to zero:</p>

<p>In the plot above if you look at people with two or more doses instead of only two doses, they continue to have lower CMR than the general population of England even after the third dose is rolled out.</p>

<div>
<img src=i/statistic-kirsch-cataract-4.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>A reason why diagnoses for cataracts have increased might be because more people decided to get diagnosed in order to get a cataract surgery, and not necessarily because the prevalence of cataracts has increased. A Guardian article from 2024 said that there has been a boom in cataract surgeries in the past few years: [<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/16/boom-in-cataract-surgery-in-england-as-private-clinics-eye-huge-profits>https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/16/boom-in-cataract-surgery-in-england-as-private-clinics-eye-huge-profits</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of thousands more NHS patients a year are having cataracts removed in England in a boom driven by private clinics - but funded by taxpayers.</p>
<p>Doctors say the trend, which now means nearly 60% of NHS cataract operations are outsourced to private providers - up from 24% five years ago - is piling pressure on already stretched NHS finances and sapping the funds needed for more serious conditions that can lead to blindness.</p>
<p>The surgery, a painless procedure to treat blurry vision by replacing the eye's natural lens with an artificial one, usually takes 10 to 15 minutes and has become increasingly routine.</p>
<p>The Royal College of Ophthalmologists says the number of cataract treatments has jumped by nearly 40% from pre-pandemic levels, meaning an extra 200,000 people a year are having the procedure on the NHS. It claims the jump is down to outsourcing to the private sector.</p>
<p>But Ben Burton, the college's president, says that while the independent sector helped reduce backlogs after the pandemic, it has <span class="quote">"continued to expand to a level where there's less and less benefit and more and more cost"</span>.</p>
<p>The Royal National Institute of Blind People is also concerned that the use of private providers is having a <span class="quote">"destabilising effect on NHS eye care services"</span>. It said: <span class="quote">"It is also important to take into consideration the unequitable nature of the expansion of the independent sector, which has shown significant regional variation and favoured affluent areas."</span></p>
<p>NHS spending on cataracts has doubled in five years and there has been a jump in outsourcing, according to research published in March by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI) thinktank.</p>
<p>Its analysis of data from 37 of 42 integrated care boards in England found that the NHS paid private clinics about £700m for cataracts from 2018-19 to 2022-23, which doubled its overall annual spending on cataract procedures in NHS hospitals and private clinics from £218m to £437m.</p>
<p>Over the five-year period, this helped push the share of the NHS eye care budget that is spent on cataracts up from 27% to 36%.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Free NHS cataract surgery in four weeks."</span> This tempting offer appears on Google when you search for SpaMedica, the biggest private provider of cataract surgery to the health service. It advises patients to ask their optician or GP to refer them for treatment at a hospital of their choice and says they should hear back within two to three weeks.</p>
<p>The top five companies providing cataract surgery to the NHS have opened 101 new eye clinics between them over the past five years, taking the total to 126 in England. In 2022, they collectively made pretax profits of more than £100m, according to figures filed at Companies House, with SpaMedica earning £72m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why diagnoses for diabetic cataracts (H28.0) suddenly skyrocketed in the financial year 2022-2023 might be if NHS provided a higher payment for diabetic cataract surgeries than other cataract surgeries. The Guardian article said that the NHS coding system allowed private providers of cataract surgeries to claim a higher payment in cases where the patient had comorbidities, and that NHS had to change the payment scheme in 2024 due to widespread abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NHS England has recently taken private contractors to task over a marked increase in <span class="quote">"complex"</span> cataract procedures, for which the charges were as much as £400 higher. Complex cases have risen 144% in five years and the CHPI estimates this has cost the NHS £29m extra over the last two years alone.</p>
<p>An NHS England consultation raised concerns about the rise in December 2022, saying it could not be explained by changes in patient complexity. In an official response to the consultation the following month, the royal college suggested the increase could be down to a practice known as <span class="quote">"upcoding"</span>.</p>
<p>All treatments have payment codes and upcoding means providers charge for a more expensive one than they performed.</p>
<p>The opportunity to do this is there, according to Simon Peck, who worked for the insurer Axa for nearly 25 years as head of audit and investigations, because the NHS coding system allows providers to claim additional payment where a case is more complicated or the patient is older or has comorbidities. <span class="quote">"This choice is offered for good reasons; however, it also opens the door to potential abuse, particularly if there are not sufficient controls and procedures in place."</span></p>
<p>Hare of the IHPN said: <span class="quote">"Robust checks, including external audits, are in place and local NHS integrated care systems, who commission healthcare activity, work closely with providers to ensure that coding is accurate."</span></p>
<p>NHS England changed the tariffs in April this year so there is only a £30 difference between routine and complex cataract treatments - £868 for a routine operation and £898 for a complex cataract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found a UK document titled <span class="quote">"Understanding Coding in Ophthalmology"</span>: <a href=https://uk-oa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UKOA_Publications_Coding_Background_to_Coding_for_Ophthalmologists_Aug_2018.pdf.><a href="https://uk-oa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UKOA_Publications_Coding_Background_to_Coding_for_Ophthalmologists_Aug_2018.pdf" class="uri">https://uk-oa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UKOA_Publications_Coding_Background_to_Coding_for_Ophthalmologists_Aug_2018.pdf</a>.</a> On pages 11-12, the document gave an example of two ways to code for the same case. In one example the primary diagnosis was listed as H26.9 (cataract, unspecified) but in the other example the primary diagnosis was listed as H28.0 (diabetic cataract). And next a note said: <span class="quote">"By simply recording that this is a diabetic cataract, rather than just a cataract, and by recording the two systemic conditions (vascular dementia and congestive cardiac failure) the hospital is paid more."</span></p>

<p>Relative to the average of the business years starting in 2015 to 2019, the average number of diagnoses in the business years starting in 2021 and 2022 was also about 300% higher for the diagnosis H26.8 (other specified cataract) and about 400% higher for H25.2 (senile cataract, morgagnian type):</p>

<p>Kirsch didn't cite a source for his plot of H28 diagnoses but he just wrote that <span class="quote">"I screen grabbed this image during a recent conference call."</span> [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/eye-issues-skyrocket-after-the-covid>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/eye-issues-skyrocket-after-the-covid</a>] The plot looks like it was made by the same author who made the plot below that showed diagnoses for a family history of breast cancer. The plot was featured prominently in a letter that Andrew Bridgen sent to members of the UK parliament in 2024: [<a href=https://ethicalapproach.co.uk/healthdataletter.pdf>https://ethicalapproach.co.uk/healthdataletter.pdf</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-kirsch-cataract-6.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>Bridgen's plot might seem scary at first if you don't pay attention to how it shows diagnoses for family history of breast cancer, which presumably wouldn't have been impacted as much by vaccination as the actual incidence of breast cancer (because the family history of cancer is based on the incidence over several decades so it doesn't change as fast as the actual incidence of breast cancer). Bridgen also didn't mention that his plot showed only primary diagnoses, but the family history diagnosis is not even meant to be used as a primary diagnosis according to NHS guidelines. And his plot only started in the business year 2012-2013, so it didn't show that there was a fairly high number of primary diagnoses for family history of breast cancer in the business year 2009-2010 and earlier: [<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1804448406535868862>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1804448406535868862</a>]</p>

<p>HART also published a Substack post which included a screenshot of another email where ONS said that the number of people who had been excluded because of the error was only 2,044: [<a href=https://hartuk.substack.com/p/have-ons-admitted-to-problems-with>https://hartuk.substack.com/p/have-ons-admitted-to-problems-with</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ons-email-7.png width=800>
</div>
<p>At first I was confused why HART's Substack post said that <span class="quote">"the ONS have only admitted to fewer than 2,044 deaths being misclassified"</span>, even though the email said that 2,044 people were excluded because they died soon after vaccination (and not fewer than 2,044 people). But Clare Craig replied to me that the reason why she said it was fewer than 2,044 people was because all 2,044 people were not linked to the dataset for mortality by vaccination status, as was explained in the ONS bulletins.</p>
<p>HART's Substack post didn't include the date of the email, even though I think the email was from 2022. People on social media were making it seem like it was some kind of breaking news that the ONS had only now admitted the error, even though ONS had already mentioned the error in the bulletin for the 6th edition of their dataset which was published in May 2022, and they mentioned the error in the bulletin for each subsequent edition until the final 9th edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulletin of the 6th edition of the ONS dataset from May 2022 said: <span class="quote">"In rare cases, a vaccination may not be recorded if the person has died soon after vaccination and before the record is entered into the system. We therefore include in our dataset an extract of people who died soon after vaccination and do not have a record in NIMS up to 15 February 2022. There were 2,044 people who were vaccinated but not included in the NIMS data as their vaccine record was entered after they had died. Of these, 1,393 linked to our PHDA dataset."</span> [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31march2022>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31march2022</a>] So the total number of vaccination entries that were missing from the ONS dataset was not even 2,044, because about one third of the 2,044 people were not linked to the ONS dataset. The 6th edition was the first edition of the ONS dataset which included the note about missing vaccination records.</li>
<li>The bulletin for the 7th edition from July 2022 said: <span class="quote">"In rare cases, a vaccination may not be recorded if the person has died soon after vaccination and before the record is entered into the system. We therefore include in our dataset an extract of people who died soon after vaccination and do not have a record in NIMS up to 25 May 2022. There were 1,436 people who linked to our PHDA dataset who were vaccinated but not included in the NIMS data as their vaccine record was entered after they had died."</span> [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31may2022>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31may2022</a>] The reason why there were now 91 more added people than in the previous edition could've been because there was now about 4 months more data.</li>
<li>The bulletin for the 8th edition from February 2023 said: <span class="quote">"In rare cases, a vaccination may not be recorded if the person has died soon after vaccination and before the record is entered into the system. We therefore include in our dataset an extract of people who died soon after vaccination and do not have a record in NIMS up to 1 November 2022. There were 1,027 new vaccination entries for people who linked to our Census 2021 linked dataset who were vaccinated but not included in the NIMS data as their vaccine record was entered after they had died."</span> [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31december2022>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31december2022</a>] The wording had now been changed so that the paragraph said <span class="quote">"There were 1,027 new vaccination entries"</span>, so at first I thought the figure might have only included new vaccination entries that had been added since the previous edition. But I don't think that's actually the case, and the reason why the number of added deaths was now lower than in the two previous editions is more likely because it was missing deaths from the first 3 months of 2021 which were no longer included in the 8th edition.</li>
<li>The bulletin for the 9th edition from August 2023 said: <span class="quote">"In rare cases, a vaccination may not be recorded if the person has died soon after vaccination and before the record is entered into the system. We therefore include in our dataset an extract of people who died soon after vaccination and do not have a record in NIMS up to 28 June 2023. There were 1,484 new vaccination entries for people who linked to our 2021 Census-linked dataset who were vaccinated but not included in the NIMS data as their vaccine record was entered after they had died."</span> [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023</a>] So it again used the same wording as the 8th edition where it said that there were <span class="quote">"1,484 new vaccination entries"</span>, but it probably doesn't mean that there were 1,484 new entries that had been added since the previous edition, but rather that there were 1,484 total vaccination entries that had been added since the start of the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in any case, the ONS has already corrected the error and added in the missing vaccination entries, but it didn't make much difference to the overall mortality rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The latest 9th edition of the ONS dataset includes a total of 986,395 deaths in vaccinated people, so even 2,000 extra deaths wouldn't make much difference. And it could be that some of the missing vaccination entries were for second or further doses, so some of the added vaccination entries didn't necessarily turn unvaccinated deaths into vaccinated deaths but they could've turned deaths in people with one dose into deaths in people with 2 doses, or deaths in people with 3 doses into deaths in people with 4 doses.</p>
<p>In 2021 and 2022, Norman Fenton, Martin Neil, Clare Craig, et al. published a series of preprints where they presented various alternative hypotheses to explain phenomena in the ONS dataset which they claimed were anomalies but which the ONS said were due to the healthy vaccinee effect. The phenomena included a low number of deaths in the first two weeks after vaccination, a high number of non-COVID deaths in unvaccinated people that coincided with the rollout of the first dose, and an increase in ASMR of people with n-1 doses when the nth dose was rolled out. Even though a lot of evidence had been presented since then that the phenomena can in fact be explained by the healthy vaccinee effect, in March 2024 Martin Neil still tweeted: <span class="quote">"There is no evidence of a healthy vaccinee effect. You are signing up to an assumption usually exploited to pretend vaccines are effective. We demonstrated this using the ONS's own data."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1767991047940907318>https://x.com/MartinNeil9/status/1767991047940907318</a>]</p>
<p>After the email by the ONS was released, Norman Fenton and Martin Neil misrepresented the email as somehow indicating that their preprints about the ONS data were correct, and that the healthy vaccinee effect didn't explain the various anomalies in the ONS data that Fenton and Neil claim to have identified: [<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20240524104551/https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/we-were-right-the-uk-ons-now-admit>http://web.archive.org/web/20240524104551/https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/we-were-right-the-uk-ons-now-admit</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2021 when the UK ONS (Office for National statistics) started releasing its vaccine by mortality status reports we exposed that there were large spikes in the <em>non-covid</em>death rates in the <span class="quote">'unvaccinated'</span>. These spikes in mortality coincided with the first main vaccine rollout and did so for each age group (see this <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28055.09124>report</a>, for example).</p>
<p>Here is the chart for non-covid mortality rates in weeks 1-38 of 2021 for the 60-69 age groups:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ons-email-fenton.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The charts for the other age groups looked much the same.</p>
<p>We asserted that these obvious anomalies were a result of the standard ONS procedure of categorising anyone within 20 days of their first dose as <span class="quote">'unvaccinated'</span>. However, in our own discussions with the ONS they maintained that, although that method <strong><em>was </em></strong>used for their efficacy calculations, it was <strong><em>not </em></strong>used when it came to mortality. They clearly said that a person dying any time after vaccination was correctly categorised, as a vaccinated death, in the mortality data they regularly released to the public and which formed the basis of a massive public communication campaign encouraging vaccination.</p>
<p>To <span class="quote">'explain'</span> the spikes the ONS pushed the implicit assumption that there was a phenomenon called the <span class="quote">'healthy vaccinee'</span> effect, whereby they claimed that people <span class="quote">'close to death'</span> were not vaccinated. And they made this bold claim without any data to support it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that this would have contradicted the NHS policy at the time we showed that, while a healthy vaccinee effect might have partly explained the longer term lower non-covid mortality rates in the vaccinated, it could not possibly have explained those spikes in mortality rates.</p>
<p>They could <strong><em>only </em></strong>be explained by categorising deaths shortly after vaccination as unvaccinated. Yet the ONS, along with many of the staunchest covid vaccine disciples, doubled down on their insistence that such miscategorisation did not occur. To them all the anomalies in the ONS data could only be explained by the hallowed <span class="quote">'healthy vaccinee effect'</span>.</p>
<p>Later, the ONS did actually <a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/can-our-detractors-decide-if-vaccinees-are-especially-healthy-or-especially-unhealthy>claim</a> that there was indeed an <span class="quote">'unhealthy vaccinee effect'</span> but did so to explain other anomalies in the data. Clearly the ONS was so self-serving they did not see the contradictions between these claims and simply wanted to have their cake and eat it.</p>
<p>As a result of a subject access request that Clare Craig submitted to the ONS we have now found out that we were correct after all!</p>
<p>Clare has posted on this twitter/X <a href=https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1793622868565299341>thread</a>, an internal ONS email confirming that the NIMS database of vaccinated people, that the ONS relied upon, had excluded those people who had died before vaccine records had been sent back to the central system:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/ons-email-fenton-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>When we pointed out to the ONS exactly this possibility for miscategorisation in 2021 they continued to deny that it had happened (see Table 8 of our report <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12472.42248>here</a>).</p>
<p>Why is this so important? Because the ONS data - possibly more so than any other source of data in the world - was used to bolster the claim that the vaccines were highly effective and safe.</p>
<p>And, as we have always argued, and which is now certain, any claims of efficacy and safety based on their data were completely illusionary and subject to the <a href=https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-very-best-of-cheap-trick>cheap trick</a> of miscategorisation whereby even a placebo - or something even worse - could be <span class="quote">'shown'</span> to be safe and effective.</p>
<p>They therefore lied and intentionally created and spread misinformation. We were accused of conspiracy thinking and our reputations were tarnished as a result.</p>
<p>But we were right!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the ONS had already fixed the issue of the missing vaccination entries in 2022, but it didn't have much effect on the overall mortality rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people still have a big spike in non-COVID deaths in early 2021, there's still low mortality in the first 3 weeks after vaccination, and the ASMR of people with n-1 doses still shoots up when the nth dose is rolled out. So the various phenomena which Fenton and Neil attempted to explain in their preprints are still present in the ONS dataset even though the error of the missing vaccination records was already fixed. So the error was not sufficient to explain the phenomena, so Fenton and Neil still need to come up with some other way to explain them.</p>

<p>Steve Kirsch posted this Substack post about a short comment type paper that was published in The Lancet: [<a href=https://kirschsubstack.com/p/uk-ons-excess-deaths-in-the-uk-cannot>https://kirschsubstack.com/p/uk-ons-excess-deaths-in-the-uk-cannot</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-lancet.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The paper said: <span class="quote">"The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) has calculated that there were 7.2% or 44,255 more deaths registered in the UK in 2022 based on comparison with the five-year average (excluding 2020). This persisted into 2023 with 8.6% or 28,024 more deaths registered in the first six months of the year than expected."</span> [<a href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762%2823%2900221-1/fulltext>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762%2823%2900221-1/fulltext</a>]</p>
<p>The paper was published in December 2023 before the ONS had published their new methodology for calculating excess deaths, so the paper still used the old 5-year average method to calculate the baseline number of deaths. However the 5-year average baseline overestimates excess deaths because there is an increasing trend in the yearly number of deaths but the 5-year average baseline is lagging 3 years behind the trend (or 4 years behind the trend from 2021 onwards since the year 2020 is excluded).</p>
<p>In the plot below I used a more accurate method to calculate the baseline for excess deaths for the green line. I first calculated a linear trend in CMR by 5-year age groups in 2010-2019, then I projected the trend for each age group to 2020-2023, and I multiplied the population size of each age group with the projected trend to get the expected deaths, and I added together the expected deaths for all age groups to get the total expected deaths for each year. It gave me only about 3.9% excess deaths in England and Wales in 2022 and about 3.3% excess deaths in 2023:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/covidstat-onsbase-4.png width=600>
</div>
<p>In the plot above I looked at deaths by registration date like the paper in Lancet, but I only included England and Wales instead of the whole UK, and I looked at deaths in the whole of 2023 instead of only the first 6 months of 2023.</p>
<p>In the plot above I used data from the spreadsheet which accompanied the article by the ONS about the new baseline methodology, which has data for monthly deaths by registration date and monthly population estimates that is grouped by 5-year age groups and region of UK: <a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024.><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024" class="uri">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/estimatingexcessdeathsintheukmethodologychanges/february2024</a>.</a> I posted R code for making the plot here: <a href=#Clare_Craig_New_baseline_used_by_ONS_to_calculate_excess_deaths>#Clare_Craig_New_baseline_used_by_ONS_to_calculate_excess_deaths</a>.

<p>The data shows that children who received the shots are 4423%/45x more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children.</p>
<p>Additionally, vaxxed children are 13,633%/137x more likely to die of COVID-19 than those who didn't receive an mRNA injection.</p>
<p>The stunning figures were revealed in recently published ONS data regarding deaths by vaccination status in England.</p>
<p>The latest dataset from the ONS is titled <span class="quote">"Deaths by Vaccination Status, England, 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022."</span></p>
<p>The disturbing data reveals that triple-vaccinated teenagers are 136% / 2.35x more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated teenagers.</p>
<p>they are also 38% more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated teenagers.</p>
<p>The worst figures in terms of all-cause deaths are however among double-vaccinated teenagers.</p>
<p>Official UK government data reveals that double-vaccinated teenagers, with a mortality rate of 36.17 per 100,000 person-years, are 149.3% / 2.5 times more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated teenagers with a mortality rate of 14.51 per 100,000 person-years.</p>
<p>To summarise, the official UK government figures published by the UK's Office for National Statistics, prove that Covid mRNA-vaccinated children and teenagers are far more likely to die of both COVID-19 and any other cause than children and teenagers who have never received a shot.</p>
<p>The data proves that <span class="quote">"vaccination"</span> is actually worsening the immune response to the alleged virus and increasing the risk of both hospitalization and death.</p>
<p>However, regarding all-cause deaths, Covid mRNA injections are directly killing children.</p>

<p>However the tweet by Camus was misleading because it said that <span class="quote">"children who received Covid mRNA shots are 45 times more likely to die from any cause than unvaccinated kids"</span>. But actually if you look at the data for ages 10 to 14, it was only the group <span class="quote">"Third dose or booster, at least 21 days ago"</span> who had about 45 times higher CMR than unvaccinated children, and the group made up only about 0.5% of total vaccinated person-years. And in ages 10 to 14, vaccinated people as a whole had only about 1.2 times higher CMR than unvaccinated people. The table below shows data for all-cause deaths in ages 10 to 14 from Table 6 of the 7th edition of the ONS dataset, which included data from January 2021 up to May 2022:</p>

<p>If the table which showed total mortality rate over the entire study period would've also been included in the two newest editions of the ONS dataset, the total CMR of unvaccinated people in ages 10 to 14 might have eventually crossed above vaccinated people. In the two newest editions the youngest age group was 18 to 39. The output below shows cumulative deaths per 100k person-years in ages 18 to 39 up to the month shown in the first column. Vaccinated CMR was initially higher, which might have been because vaccinated people were older than unvaccinated people, or because vulnerable groups of people had been priorized for vaccination, but unvaccinated CMR eventually crossed above vaccinated CMR in December 2021 (but in ages 10 to 14 it probably took longer for unvaccinated CMR to cross above vaccinated CMR because ages 10 to 14 got vaccinated later than ages 18 to 39):</p>

<p>Uncle John Returns posted a plot which showed that there was a sharply increasing trend in the number of finished consultant episodes before the 2014/15 year: [<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1853728916680171803>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1853728916680171803</a>]</p>

<p>Craig seems to have used the average number of admissions between the 2014/15 and 2019/20 years as her baseline, but it's not necessarily accurate relative to the long-term trend since 1998. For some reason Craig only started the x-axis from the year 2014/15, even though it might that she didn't bother checking earlier years because it's a pain in to extract data for each year from a different spreadsheet. [<a href=https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity>https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity</a>]</p>
<p>The title of Craig's plot said <span class="quote">"Finished Admisison Episodes"</span>, but her plot seems to have shown the column for <span class="quote">"finished consultant episodes"</span> and not the column for hospital admissions which was slightly lower:</p>

<p>The website of NHS says: <span class="quote">"The HES data used in this publication are called <span class="quote">'Finished Consultant Episodes'</span>, and each episode relates to a period of care for a patient under a single consultant at a single hospital. Therefore, this report counts the number of episodes of care for admitted patients rather than the number of patients."</span> [<a href=https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/2023-24>https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/2023-24</a>]</p>
<p>Uncle John Returns also posted this plot which shows that the ASMR for UCD multiple sclerosis was around the same level in the 2022/23 and 2023/24 years as in the years before COVID (and the reason why it was temporarily reduced in 2021/22 might be if people didn't get diagnosed for MS during COVID, because there was also a dip in diagnoses in the 2020/21 year): [<a href=https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1853728931314106679>https://x.com/UncleJo46902375/status/1853728931314106679</a>]</p>

<p>In the replies of Clare Craig's tweet people also pointed out that there had been no clear increase in MS diagnoses in Sweden, Finland, Germany, or Norway. [<a href=https://x.com/benfire71/status/1853556312782549489>https://x.com/benfire71/status/1853556312782549489</a>]</p>
<p>Clare Craig wrote: <span class="quote">"Surely <span class="quote">'bed days'</span> includes <span class="quote">'day cases'</span>. Even if it doesn't, surely more people are affected in total when there are more day cases but fewer inpatients with multiple bed days."</span> [<a href=https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1853829361511682081>https://x.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1853829361511682081</a>] However day cases seem to have a duration of zero days, because the spreadsheet for the year 2012-2013 included a sheet which described some of the terminology, where a day case was given this definition: <span class="quote">"The count of FCEs relating to day cases. Day cases are inpatients who have been admitted for treatment just for the day. They are therefore always single episode spells with a duration of zero days. The intention is for treatment to be concluded in one day. If, unexpectedly, the patient is kept overnight, it must be re-classed as an ordinary admission."</span> [<a href=https://files.digital.nhs.uk/publicationimport/pub12xxx/pub12566/hosp-epis-stat-admi-diag-2012-13-tab.xlsx>https://files.digital.nhs.uk/publicationimport/pub12xxx/pub12566/hosp-epis-stat-admi-diag-2012-13-tab.xlsx</a>] The definition for length of stay also said that day cases are excluded: <span class="quote">"The mean (average) and median (middle in ranking) of the spell duration in days. A spell is a period of continuous admitted patient care within a particular NHS trust, calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date. In HES, this involves selecting records that are the last in the spell and therefore contain a discharge date. All 'discharge records' also carry an admission date because, where the spell consists of more than one episode, the admission date is carried forward from earlier episode(s) in the spell. Day cases, which have a length of stay of zero days, are excluded from this calculation."</span></p>
<p>In order to start counting the length of hospitalizations from one day instead of zero days, you can add together these three terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>day_cases</code> (treat day cases as one-day instead of zero-day hospitalizations)</li>
<li><code>bed_days</code> (bed days of non-day case hospitalizations from second day onward)</li>
<li><code>(admissions - day_cases)</code> (include first day for non-day case hospitalizations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the long-term trend in bed days becomes much more flat like in my light red line here:</p>

<p>The number of admissions multiplied by the mean length of admissions is much higher than bed days, because the mean length doesn't include day case admissions. But if you calculate <code>(admissions - day_cases) * mean_length</code> then it's roughly equal to bed days.</p>
<p>About 90-95% of hospitalizations in the NHS dataset have been day cases in the 10 most recent years. The number of single-day hospitalizations for MS is not necessarily even a good indication of the overall prevalence of MS, because treatment practices might change over time. ChatGPT gave the following list of reasons why people would be hospitalized for MS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <strong>Severe Relapses or Exacerbations</strong>: MS is a relapsing-remitting disease, and during severe flare-ups, people may experience a significant worsening of symptoms, like sudden loss of motor control, vision issues, or severe fatigue, which may require intensive treatment and monitoring in a hospital.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Infections</strong>: Due to a compromised immune system (either from the disease itself or from immunosuppressive treatments), people with MS are more susceptible to infections. Infections can worsen MS symptoms and may require intravenous antibiotics or other treatments in a hospital.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Mobility and Safety Concerns</strong>: Severe MS can impair mobility, which may lead to falls or injuries. Hospitalization may be necessary for managing such injuries, particularly fractures or head trauma.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Complications from Medication</strong>: Some medications used to treat MS, such as immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, can have side effects that require hospital care, like infusion reactions, liver issues, or changes in blood cell counts.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Neurological Symptoms</strong>: In advanced MS, severe neurological symptoms like seizures, loss of consciousness, or extreme cognitive difficulties might require close monitoring and specialized care.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Rehabilitation</strong>: Some MS patients require intensive rehabilitation due to worsening physical or cognitive symptoms. Hospital stays can help them access physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other supportive services to improve function and independence.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Pain Management</strong>: Chronic pain is common in MS, and in cases where it becomes severe and unmanageable at home, patients may need a short hospital stay for pain management through advanced medications or specialized care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when I asked why people would be hospitalized for MS for a single day, ChatGPT answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <strong>Medication Infusions</strong>: Certain MS treatments, like corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) for an acute relapse, can be administered as a high-dose infusion over a few hours. Often, a single dose can start providing relief, and patients can complete the course at home or return for follow-up infusions without staying overnight.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Diagnostics and Imaging</strong>: If a person with MS experiences new or worsening symptoms, they may need urgent MRI scans or other imaging tests to check for new lesions. Sometimes, these tests can be completed, and results reviewed, within the same day, allowing patients to leave with an updated treatment plan.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Evaluation and Observation</strong>: If someone with MS presents with new symptoms that aren't severe but need observation (like mild balance issues, fatigue, or sensory changes), they may be admitted for short-term monitoring. If symptoms don't escalate, they may be discharged the same day with instructions on follow-up care.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Outpatient Procedures</strong>: Certain outpatient procedures, like lumbar punctures to assess cerebrospinal fluid or blood tests for treatment monitoring, can be done within a single day. These may be necessary to evaluate treatment effectiveness or diagnose issues, but they don't usually require an overnight stay.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Infusion Reactions</strong>: Some MS therapies, especially newer monoclonal antibodies, are given as infusions, which sometimes require monitoring for allergic reactions. If a person tolerates the treatment well after a few hours, they may be discharged with precautions.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Pain Management</strong>: For patients experiencing sudden, severe MS-related pain that doesn't respond to home treatment, a single-day stay can provide intensive pain management (like injections or IV pain relief) and, if effective, allow them to return home the same day with follow-up medications.</p>

<a href=#Daily_Telegraph_article_about_a_40_increase_in_hospitalizations_for_strokes id=Daily_Telegraph_article_about_a_40_increase_in_hospitalizations_for_strokes>Daily Telegraph article about a 40% increase in hospitalizations for strokes</a>
</h2>
<p>Someone posted this headline of a Daily Telegraph article on Twitter and suggested that the increase in deaths was due to <span class="quote">"mRNA transfections"</span> (because he was a fan of Jar Jar Couey):</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-stroke-1.jpg width=400>
</div>
<p>However he should've read past the headline, because the article said that the increase in hospitalizations had been over the past 20 years: <span class="quote">"Official figures released to The Telegraph show cases among men and women in their 50s are rising faster than in any age group - with a 55 per cent rise in cases in 20 years. [...] NHS England data show 111,137 hospital admissions for strokes in England in 2023-24, up from 87,069 in 2004-05."</span> [<a href=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/16/stroke-middle-aged-50s-warning-nhs/>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/16/stroke-middle-aged-50s-warning-nhs/</a>]</p>
<p>I think the public hospitalization data published by NHS does not include the number of hospital admissions by age group but only the number of finished consultant episodes, which are periods of care under a single consultant at a single hospital. But I don't know if the Daily Telegraph article showed data for hospital admissions or for finished consultant episodes. The article also had data for hospitalizations by 10-year age groups, but old releases of the NHS hospitalization data only included the 4 broad age groups (even though new releases include more fine-grained 5-year age groups).</p>
<p>But anyway, in the plot below which shows finished consultant episodes instead of hospital admissions, the increase between the 2004-05 and 2023-24 years was about 105% in ages 15-59 and about 96% in ages 60-74, so it's even bigger than the percentage increase in hospitalizations that was reported by Daily Telegraph. My plot was not adjusted for population size but the Telegraph's statistics might have been adjusted for population size. But in either case there hasn't been any dramatic increase in finished consultant episodes since COVID vaccines were rolled out: [<a href=https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/>https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/</a>]</p>

<p>I just took another look at our ONS death by vaccination status.</p>
<p>Here is age adjusted mortality rate in the first 21 days after each dose. If benign these would be the same.</p>
<p>There are two periods: First 5 months: main rollout to those at risk of dying. Post May - main rollout to those not at risk of dying but continuing jabs in people newly sick and hospitalised.</p>
<p>First half - 1st dose way more deadly than 2nd - survivorship bias.</p>
<p>Second half - slightly noisier data and higher mortality (because at risk population targeted) but no longer a difference between 1st and 2nd doses.</p>

<p>However I pointed out that a large part of the difference in January 2021 is because people with one dose have much higher COVID ASMR than people with two doses, which might be if it took a couple of weeks after vaccination for the immune response to build up:</p>

<p>In the plot above the <span class="quote">"late vaccinee effect"</span> is particularly clear for third doses, where people who got the third dose after the rollout peak had passed had much higher mortality than people who got the third dose during the rollout peak. The late vaccinee effect also starts to impact first doses slightly earlier than second doses. However I don't know why for example first doses have about 4 times higher ASMR than second doses in March 2021, even though there were no longer that many COVID deaths in March.</p>
<p>Compared to people who received the second dose less than 21 days ago, people who received the first dose less than 21 days ago have more person-days in early January 2021 relative to late January 2021. So at first I thought maybe there were more COVID deaths in early January than late January, but actually it's the other way around:</p>

<p>Berenson thought that the plot showed the percentage of COVID deaths in the vaccination status group out of all COVID deaths, but actually the plot shows the percentage of COVID deaths out of all deaths within the vaccination status group, which is why the percentages don't add up to 100%: [<a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand2july2021>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand2july2021</a>]</p>

<p>However there's a bias because unvaccinated people have more person-years during the COVID wave in early 2021 but vaccinated people have more person-years in May and June when there was a low number of COVID deaths. So if you calculate a ratio between the percentage of COVID deaths out of all deaths between unvaccinated and vaccinated people, the ratio is higher for all months aggregated together than for most individual months:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-berenson-3.png width=500>
</div>
<p>If you look at monthly data from the 9th and 7th editions of the ONS dataset combined, the ratio between unvaccinated and vaccinated people for COVID deaths out of all deaths peaked in December 2021. But by 2023 the ratio was much lower, which might be if unvaccinated people acquired natural immunity over time or if the effect of vaccination wore out over time:</p>

<a href=#Problems_with_Fenton_and_Neils_n_1_dose_misclassification_hypothesis id=Problems_with_Fenton_and_Neils_n_1_dose_misclassification_hypothesis>Problems with Fenton and Neil's n-1 dose misclassification hypothesis</a>
</h2>
<p>In the ONS dataset for deaths by vaccination status, the ASMR of people with n-1 doses shoots up when the nth dose is rolled out. Fenton and Neil hypothesized it was because people who died soon after receiving the nth dose were misclassified under dose n-1.</p>
<p>The next plot demonstrates three major problems with their hypothesis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People with one but not more doses continue to have a high mortality rate even in 2023, even though there's few new people who are getting a second dose in 2023 so that they could be misclassified under the first dose if they die soon after getting the second dose.</li>
<li>If a lot of extra people died soon after they got the third dose, then why is there no big increase to the mortality rate of people with two or more doses when the third dose is rolled out? There is only an increase in the mortality rate of people with two but not more doses, but the group of people with two or more doses should also include people who are misclassified under the second dose if they die soon after getting the third dose.</li>
<li>In November 2021 when the third dose was rolled out, people with three doses had about 68% lower mortality rate than the general population of England. If there is no evidence of the healthy vaccinee effect in the ONS data like Fenton has suggested, then what explains the low mortality rate? (Fenton might argue it's because within the first two or three weeks from the third dose, person-years are counted under under the third dose but deaths are counted under the second dose. But when I first read the papers by Fenton et al., I didn't realize they suggested that the misclassification delay was only applied to the numerator for deaths but not to the denominator for population size. And if I had realized that Fenton's hypothesis required the misclassification delay to only be applied to the numerator but not to the denominator, I would have considered the hypothesis to be much less plausible.)</li>

sub=&quot;\u00a0     The ONS dataset for mortality by vaccination status was released in August 2023, and the dataset for deaths in the general English population was released in July 2023, so both datasets are missing some deaths because of a registration delay in 2023 (but the dataset for deaths in the general population is missing a larger percentage of deaths in May 2023, which explains why ever vaccinated people get positive excess mortality here in May 2023).
      Data for the first three months of 2021 is taken from the July 2022 edition of the ONS dataset which was linked against the 2011 census, and data for other months is taken from the August 2023 edition which was linked against the 2021 census.

<p>(The plot above shows CMR instead of ASMR values because it's not possible to add together ASMR values for multiple dose categories, but it is possible to calculate a CMR value for multiple dose categories combined if you just add together deaths and divide it with the person-years added together. I plotted CMR only for a single age group because total CMR for all ages would've been heavily confounded by age. I arbitrarily picked the age group 80-89, but the results for other age groups are similar.)</p>
<p>This plot also demonstrates that in mid-2021 when the ASMR of people with one but not more doses shoots up, the ASMR of people with one or more doses remains flat:</p>

<p>In the plot for example the year 2022 refers to the years 2021-2023 combined. The reason why the mortality rate of blacks went down between 2022 and 2023 might be due to a small sample size of deaths, because blacks also had a big increase in mortality rate between 2014 and 2015. The spreadsheet included with the report did not show the number of deaths, but it did include confidence intervals which were very wide for blacks:</p>

<p>Fenton and Neil published a Substack post about the same English data. They downloaded the data and made their own plot that only included whites and blacks, but for some reason they omitted the confidence intervals from their plot. Fenton and Neil didn't even explain that the decrease in mortality rate in blacks might have been due to the wide confidence intervals: [<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250115024255/https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/why-did-maternal-mortality-in-white>https://web.archive.org/web/20250115024255/https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/why-did-maternal-mortality-in-white</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/statistic-maternal-8.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In the comments of the Substack post, Fenton claimed that whites had a statistically significant increase in maternal mortality rate between the years 2019-2021 and 2020-2022. Me and another user in the comments asked Fenton how he determined if the increase was significant or not, but he didn't answer. However I found the number of maternities and deaths by race from these PDF files: <a href=https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-reports/maternal-report-2019-2021>https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-reports/maternal-report-2019-2021</a>, <a href=https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-reports/maternal-report-2020-2022>https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-reports/maternal-report-2020-2022</a> (Table 2.10). Whites had 131 deaths out of 1,352,794 maternities in 2019-2021 and 152 deaths out of 1,291,758 maternities in 2020-2022. The p-value of the ratios is about 0.11 using a two-sided chi-squared test or half as big using a one-sided test, so neither is statistically significant. However the increase might still be significant based on other methods of evaluating significance, like whether the mortality rate crossed above a 95% prediction interval or not, so Fenton should've answered how he determined whether the increase was significant or not.</p>
<p>In this plot from the UK report, the green line shows that COVID explains the increase in indirect deaths since the three-year period centered in 2020:</p>

<img src=i/statistic-maternal-5.png width=600>

<p>If the United States if you look at the increase in pregnancy-related deaths between 2020 and 2021, it's low Asians who had a high percentage of vaccinated people, but it's high in Native Americans, Hispanics, and blacks, who had a lower percentage of vaccinated people:</p>

<p>However the percentage increase in deaths from drug overdoses between 2020 and 2021 was also low for Asians, and some of the pregnancy-related deaths might be due to drug use (even though drug deaths had a bigger increase between 2019 and 2020 than between 2020 and 2021, but pregnancy-related deaths had a bigger increase between 2020 and 2021 than 2019 and 2020):</p>

<p>The next plot shows that in the US there were big spikes in deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth during the Delta and Omicron waves, but the spikes flattened out when I subtracted deaths with MCD COVID. For some reason the MCD to UCD ratio for chapter O was close to one in 1999-2002 and in 2020-2024, but between 2003 and 2019 it was much higher:</p>

<p>In the previous plot there is only a small increase in deaths during the COVID waves in spring 2020 and the winter of 2020-2021. But the ratio of COVID deaths in 2021 relative to 2020 is much higher in women of childbearing age than in elderly women, which might be because women of childbearing age were less likely to be vaccinated in 2021 than elderly women:</p>

</h2>
<p>David Dickson posted this plot which shows excess deaths in England and Wales calculated using four different baselines: [<a href=https://x.com/dksdata/status/1885379612210766228/photo/1>https://x.com/dksdata/status/1885379612210766228/photo/1</a>]</p>

</div>
<p>At first I wasn't sure if blue line meant a 2010-2019 average or the average of the past 10 years, but in another similar plot he indicated that the blue baseline was a 2010-2019 average. [<a href=https://x.com/dksdata/status/1842957444562944148>https://x.com/dksdata/status/1842957444562944148</a>] And one of the boxes in the plot above also indicates that the blue baseline is a <span class="quote">"pre pandemic 10 year average"</span>.</p>
<p>However the blue 2010-2019 average baseline is obviously too low due to the aging population. Here the 2010-2019 average baseline produces negative excess deaths each year between 2005 and 2014, but it produces positive excess deaths each year between 2015 and 2024. It produces high excess deaths even in the year 2019 which had unusually low mortality:</p>

sub=&quot;\u00a0     Source: ONS datasets \&quot;Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional\&quot; (for 2024) and \&quot;Estimating excess deaths in the UK, methodology changes: February 2024\&quot; (for earlier years). Both datasets include non-residents and are by date of occurrence and not registration. The number of deaths in 2024 is the number of deaths on weeks ending in 2024.
      The gray baseline is a simple average of the past five years with 2020 excluded, so for example the baseline for 2023 consists of the years 2017-2019 and 2021-2022.
      The green baseline was calculated by first taking the linear trend in CMR by five-year age groups in 2010-2019, and then the projected trend was multiplied by the population size of each age group to get the expected deaths, and the expected deaths for each age group were added together to get the yearly total expected deaths.
      The dark red baseline is a quasi-Poisson regression of the past 5 years with April to May 2020 and December 2020 to February 2021 excluded.
      The light red baseline was calculated with the R code provided by the ONS that was modified to use a fixed 2010-2019 fitting period (see sars2.net/uk.html).&quot;

<p>At Mortality Watch, England and Wales gets negative excess ASMR in 2024 is you use a 2011-2019 linear baseline: [<a href=https://mortality.watch/explorer/?c=GBRTENW&t=asmr&df=2011&bm=lin_reg>https://mortality.watch/explorer/?c=GBRTENW&amp;t=asmr&amp;df=2011&amp;bm=lin_reg</a>]</p>

<p>Faceles007 posted a thread about Dickson's plot where he wrote <span class="quote">"362k excess deaths since 🧬💉 in England and Wales and counting"</span>. [<a href=https://x.com/Faceles007/status/1885640272157249804>https://x.com/Faceles007/status/1885640272157249804</a>] But Dickson's figure of 362,249 wasn't the number of excess deaths since the vaccine rollout but since the first week of 2019. Faceles007 also wrote that <span class="quote">"Rancourt's 17 million number is garbage btw"</span>. But 362,249 excess deaths in England and Wales would be the equivalent of about 50 million excess deaths worldwide if the whole world had the same excess crude mortality rate as England and Wales (from <code>362249/6e7*8e9</code>).</p>

<p>I told her that the ONS bulletin <span class="quote">"Births in England and Wales: 2022"</span> includes this plot of stillbirths and live births going back to 1927, even though the historical data was omitted from the 2023 and 2024 editions: [<a href=https://ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2022>https://ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2022</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/uk-stillbirth-2.png width=550>

<p>The number of stillbirths and live births is included in Table 1 of the linked spreadsheet: <a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsummarytables.><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsummarytables" class="uri">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsummarytables</a>.</a> I took the stillbirth rates in 2023 and 2024 from these spreadsheets: <a href=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsinenglandandwalesbirthregistrations.><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsinenglandandwalesbirthregistrations" class="uri">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsinenglandandwalesbirthregistrations</a>.</a></p>
<p>The definition of stillbirth was changed between 1992 and 1993, so in the next plot I used the 1993-2019 linear trend as the baseline, but the stillbirth rate was below the baseline each year in 2021-2024:</p>
