CDC text messages that were also released by Hal Turner</a>
</h3>
<p>Paul Cottrell was one of the earliest YouTubers who were focused on
conspiracy content about COVID, along with Dinggang Wang and Chris
Martenson.</p>
<p>Cottrell participated in a series of video panels hosted by George
Webb's mini-me Addy Adds, which also featured Kevin McCairn and J.J.
Couey. The two guests on the first episode of Cottrell's Coronavirus War
Room were Kevin McCairn and George Webb. Cottrell was Webb's go-to guy
on COVID science and Webb's biology teacher.</p>
<p>In February 2020 Cottrell became known as <span class="quote">"the
American whistleblower"</span> in China after one of his YouTube videos
went viral in China.
[<a href=https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>baidu.<wbr>com/<wbr>s?<wbr>wd=%<wbr>22paul+<wbr>cottrell%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>gpc=stf%<wbr>3D1580508000%<wbr>2C1583013600%<wbr>7Cstftype%<wbr>3D2</a>]</p>
<p>In the video Cottrell said that he received <span class="quote">"a
text message from a listener to the channel to someone that is from the
CDC"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bilibili.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>av91204053/<wbr></a>,
0:55] Then he read the message: <span class="quote">"Hope all is well. I
was just wondering if you could fill me in on what's happening with this
coronavirus. Hearing conflicting things about it. Is it as bad as it's
said to be on the news? And should we have to worry? Thanks. Best,
[Blank]."</span> And next he read the reply that is shown in the
screenshots below. And then he said that <span class="quote">"I received
this from a person that, you know, listens to the channel, and is
connected to me on Facebook."</span> [3:22]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cdc-1.jpg width=300><img src=i/yt-cdc-2.jpg width=300>
</div>
<p>The YouTube video was posted on February 17th 2020 in an unknown
timezone.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200313152829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dw_68tV6c0>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200313152829/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=9dw_<wbr>68tV6c0</a>]
However a few days earlier in a blog post dated February 14th, the same
text messages had been released by the talk radio host Hal Turner, who
wrote that the text messages were not leaked by the person who received
the text messages, but by his 18-year-old son who took the screenshots
on his father's phone:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200217063226/<wbr>https://<wbr>halturnerradioshow.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>en/<wbr>news-<wbr>page/<wbr>news-<wbr>nation/<wbr>alleged-<wbr>c-<wbr>d-<wbr>c-<wbr>text-<wbr>messages-<wbr>say-<wbr>over-<wbr>1-<wbr>000-<wbr>infected-<wbr>with-<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>in-<wbr>u-<wbr>s-<wbr>a-<wbr>being-<wbr>deliberately-<wbr>concealed</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALLEGED C.D.C. TEXT MESSAGES SAY <span class="quote">"over
1,000"</span> INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS IN U.S.A. - BEING DELIBERATELY
CONCEALED</p>
<p>While the U.S. mass-media is reporting there are <span
class="quote">"15 confirmed cases"</span> of the deadly Chinese
Coronavirus in the US, a lead Doctor in the CDC allegedly sent a text
message to a family friend admitting <span class="quote">"there have
already been over 1,000 cases in the U.S."</span> The Text also says
they are <span class="quote">"... trying to prevent panic ..."</span></p>
<p>According to an 18 year old in upstate New York near Schenectady, his
father had a text messaging exchange with Doctor Nancy Messonnier, the
Director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and
Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) within the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC), photo below.</p>
<p>The 18 year old was allegedly using his father's cellphone and saw
the text message exchange. He became so outraged at what he read, that
he took a screen shot of the conversation and uploaded it as a video to
his social media account online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know how Hal Turner knew that the person who leaked the text
messages was <span class="quote">"an 18 year old in upstate New York
near Schenectady"</span>, because I didn't find other sources that
mentioned the age or location of the person who leaked the messages,
apart from sources that were based on Turner's blog post.</p>
<p>Even earlier on January 27th 2020 UTC, the same screenshots were
posted on TikTok by a user named user58406547:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200226155731/https://www.tiktok.com/&#x40;user58406547>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200226155731/<wbr>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>tiktok.<wbr>com/@<wbr>user58406547</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cdc-tiktok.webp width=600>
</div>
<p>The TikTok user also claimed that they took the screenshots on their
father's phone:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-tiktok-comment-1.jpg width=350><img src=i/yt-tiktok-comment-2.jpg width=350><img src=i/yt-tiktok-comment-3.jpg width=350><img src=i/yt-tiktok-comment-4.jpg width=350><img src=i/yt-tiktok-comment-5.jpg width=350>
</div>
<p>The screenshots were probably fake, because they showed the name of
the sender as <span class="quote">"Nancy Messonnier (CDC)"</span>, even
though they were screenshots of the Messages application on iOS, which
only displays the first name of the sender:
[<a href=https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>benplowman/<wbr>status/<wbr>1231447635338264576/<wbr></a>]</p>

</div>
<p>When someone on a Chinese website asked if Paul Cottrell's video was
legit, another user linked to Hal Turner's blog post and indicated that
it supported Cottrell's story:
[<a href=https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>zhihu.<wbr>com/<wbr>question/<wbr>373999679</a>]</p>

<p>Hal Turner worked as an FBI informant, and he even ran a Nazi rally
for the FBI in New York.
[<a href=https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HeadlineUSA/<wbr>status/<wbr>1807032673942020181</a>]</p>
<p>A New York Times article from 2010 said:
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>nytimes.<wbr>com/<wbr>2010/<wbr>03/<wbr>04/<wbr>nyregion/<wbr>04hal.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Turner described his repulsion to racist views even
as he became one of the country's most prominent proponents of them. He
said he never wanted anyone to get hurt.</p>
<p>Mr. Turner painted a contrarian picture of himself as a patriot who
answered the call of the federal government to infiltrate the white
supremacist movement. He said he received more than $100,000 in payments
for his assistance and helped avert <span class="quote">"more than 10
acts of domestic terrorism,"</span> but his outspokenness so concerned
the F.B.I. that the agency eventually stopped using him, and he was
later arrested.</p>
<p>He said he never believed the message he promulgated, citing a letter
he wrote to one F.B.I. agent that said, <span class="quote">"Just be
confident that the person you hear [or hear about] on radio is not real
life."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2008 Hal Turner was plotting a feigned sequel to the Oklahoma City
bombing, where his patsy was going to blow up Obama:
[<a href=https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/>https://<wbr>headlineusa.<wbr>com/<wbr>fed-<wbr>files-<wbr>iii-<wbr>fbi-<wbr>informants-<wbr>phony-<wbr>obama-<wbr>truck-<wbr>bomb-<wbr>tip-<wbr>spurred-<wbr>federal-<wbr>probe/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a plot similar to the Oklahoma City bombing: neo-Nazi Bill
White was said to have had plans in October 2008 to attack a Roanoke,
Virginia federal building with a truck bomb in retaliation for legal
proceedings taking place against him there.</p>
<p>Except this time, the <span class="quote">"plot"</span> was
non-existent, coming from a dubious source in former FBI informant and
convicted felon Hal Turner.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><span class="quote">"[The FBI informant Hal] Turner went to these two
guys and told them to set me up so he could get his informant contract
back ... they concocted a story that I [planned to] blow up Barack Obama
with a truck bomb,"</span> White told Dr. Ostrov in 2016, according to
the doctor's report.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But then, in 2010, FBI informant Turner admitted in court that he
told the feds about the phony federal building bomb plot. Turner had
been arrested for inciting violence against three federal judges, and he
was testifying in court that he was an important asset to the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020 Qtards were saying that Chinese troops tried to invade USA
through the Quebec-Maine border, but they got bombed to death. Someone
tracked the origin of the story to Hal Turner's blog:
[<a href=https://x.com/aobrien2010/status/1338675691655663616>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>aobrien2010/<wbr>status/<wbr>1338675691655663616</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/earlynews-cdc-canada-tanks.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>In the blog post, Hal Turner cited unnamed <span
class="quote">"intelligence sources"</span> as the source of his
information.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20201025014401/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/u-s-moving-self-propelled-artillery-to-border-with-quebec-reports-of-uniformed-chinese-troops-in-canada>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20201025014401/<wbr>https://<wbr>halturnerradioshow.<wbr>com/<wbr>index.<wbr>php/<wbr>en/<wbr>news-<wbr>page/<wbr>news-<wbr>nation/<wbr>u-<wbr>s-<wbr>moving-<wbr>self-<wbr>propelled-<wbr>artillery-<wbr>to-<wbr>border-<wbr>with-<wbr>quebec-<wbr>reports-<wbr>of-<wbr>uniformed-<wbr>chinese-<wbr>troops-<wbr>in-<wbr>canada</a>]</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Connection_to_Cicada_3301 id=Connection_to_Cicada_3301>Connection
to Cicada 3301</a>
</h3>
<p>In the description of one of Cottrell's early YouTube videos, there's
a link to a video from 2015 called <span class="quote">"Cicada 3301
Alpha Transmission"</span>, where the thumbnail of the video consists of
the logo of Cicada 3301:
[<a href=https://altcensored.com/watch?v=SWg1-3n4tM8>https://<wbr>altcensored.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=SWg1-<wbr>3n4tM8</a>,
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=bCmKGFTEO2g</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cicada.webp width=480>
</div>
<p>The title of the video might be a reference to how the Unicode
character with the hexadecimal code <code>3301</code> is <span
class="quote">"㌁"</span>, which is Japanese for <span
class="quote">"alpha"</span>.</p>
<p>The video was posted on a YouTube channel called <span
class="quote">"Abraham Lincoln"</span>, which Cottrell said was his
backup channel, and he said that his followers should solve the puzzle,
because it would teach them skills they might need to communicate with
each other in the future if communications between people were
restricted.</p>
<p>You can make a spectrogram of the video by running these shell
commands:
<code>yt-<wbr>dlp bCmKGFTEO2g;<wbr>ffmpeg -i *bCmKGFTEO2g*<wbr> -vn a.<wbr>wav;<wbr>sox a.<wbr>wav -n spectrogram;<wbr>qlmanage -p spectrogram.<wbr>png</code>.
The spectrogram features the logo of Cicada 3301 and an image of Abraham
Lincoln, along with the pieces of text <span class="quote">"1984 is
here"</span>, <span class="quote">"America wake up"</span>, <span
class="quote">"All your doors are unlocked"</span>, <span
class="quote">"Big Brother I am watching you"</span>, and <span
class="quote">"3301"</span>:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cicada-spectrogram.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The Abraham Lincoln video has about 600 comments, but almost all of
them were posted in 2020 when Cottrell mentioned the video. There is
only one comment posted before 2020, which says: <span
class="quote">"For future reference, if anyone is watching this the
fourth bowel strikes seven as Pluto enters the spectrogram."</span> So
it seems like a hint on how to proceed in solving the puzzle after
getting the spectrogram image:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-hint.webp width=580>
</div>
<p>The user who posted the hint has 4 YouTube videos, which are all
songs that were slowed down with reverb added. But all videos were
posted in 2019 or 2020, so they are probably not relevant to the Cicada
puzzle which was posted in 2015.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnuqErgpI4d5nW-qe6iwVQ>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>channel/<wbr>UCRnuqErgpI4d5nW-<wbr>qe6iwVQ</a>]</p>
<p>In October 2020, Cottrell posted a video on his main channel where he
recorded his screen while he played the old Abraham Lincoln video. In
the comments someone asked <span class="quote">"What is this?"</span>,
but Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"forward operations"</span>,
and when someone said it was a puzzle, Cottrell replied <span

<p>When I googled for the term <span class="quote">"forward
operations"</span> in double quotes, most results were about something
called <span class="quote">"defend forward operations"</span> or <span
class="quote">"hunt forward operations"</span>, which are terms that are
used in the context of cyber warfare and that refer to defensive cyber
operations. For example an article by U.S. Cyber Command said: <span
class="quote">"Hunt Forward Operations (HFOs) are strictly defensive
cyber operations conducted by U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) at the
request of partner nations."</span>

And a book titled <span class="quote">"The United States' Defend Forward
Cyber Strategy"</span> says: <span class="quote">"Defend Forward
operations are non-use of force actions designed to counter ongoing
hostile cyber operations taking place during day-to-day strategic
competition."</span>

<p>In March 2020 Paul Cottrell appeared as a guest on Michael Decon's
radio show together with Thomas Schoenberger. It was the first time
Schoenberger appeared on the radio show, but Cottrell had appeared on
the show a few times earlier, so Schoenberger may have gone on Decon's
show because he wanted to do a show together with Cottrell. Schoenberger
said: <span class="quote">"Dr. Cottrell, you're making a huge impact,
huge. Number one, I have a friend named Ryan, he's an endocrinologist,
he's in New York. When I first heard your show - this is, uh,

it's so daunting, but you are - you are a blessing."</span>

Douglas Gabriel and John Barnwell from AIM have done several interviews
with Cottrell's buddy Leo Zagami, who claims that he is a 33rd degree
freemason, and who had a radio show on Global Enlightenment Network

leading anthroposophists in the United States, and he has said that he
worked as a cryptologist for the NSA, that he was a Jesuit and a
freemason, and that he was tasked by the Society of Jesus to infiltrate
anthroposophy.

<p>In February 2020, Paul Cottrell posted a video where he showed a
tweet by Voice of Guo Media, which said that at a critical moment on
June 4th, Miles Guo's people would go against the top level of the CCP.
Then he said: <span class="quote">"This is code. This is a CIA code for
an operation. And what's happening is you take 6 for June 4th, 2020, ok.
Cause that's the date that he's mentioning. Take the 6 for June divided
by 2, you get 3. You take the 4 for the date divided by 2, you get 2.
You take 2020, which is 2 plus 0 plus 2 plus 0, is 4. Divide it by 2,
it's 2. When you take those answers from those ratios, it adds to 3, it
makes 3, 2, 2. That is the sign. That's the code that the CIA operation
is happening. There is a takedown of the CCP and this was the launch
code, or the operational code, or whatever you want to call it in the
military, but this is it. Save this video and share it. It's - blitz the
internet, it's gotta be blitzed. Anyone that's in IT, you can 4chan it,

<p>I don't know how Cottrell was able to tell that 322 was code
specifically for the CIA. Was it somehow bonesmen at the CIA who were
taking down the CCP?</p>
<p>There's no way Cottrell believed himself he had actually found a
secret message in the tweet. His video was so ridiculous that it's the
best single piece of evidence I have found that he was deliberately
producing disinformation (even though credit for digging up the video
goes to Housatonic, who shares my interest in documenting early coverage
of COVID in alt media).</p>

Francis Cabrel. [...] It's just the spycraft and the beauty of how Mossad
does shit. You know, I just - especially the French Mossad is just
really fantastic spycraft. And really the antecedents of that go all the
way back to World War 2. This is when they were working with OSS - and
I've said this before - they would have these radio shows at night where
they would do different songs, play different songs, and the songs were
encoded. Certain songs would mean blow up the local railroad. Thanks
Mossad homies and [something Français?] because you've helped me out so
much in this. [...]</p>
<p>(1:00) One of the things that's been so hard for me in this series is
playing the Mossad thing. Because so many people have come out against
Mossad and how evil Mossad is and so forth. [...]</p>
<p>(1:14) So that's - I'm always rooting for Mossad secretly kind of.
And this is what that is. [...]</p>
<p>(1:35) My sources, and I'm - you saw French Mossad today, you know,
give me some stuff. [...]</p>
<p>(2:54) And then there's the great Mossad, which was fundamental to
the survival of Israel. I know people are going to say we did a lot of
stuff. And you know with the Lebanese babies and the Yemeni babies and
Palestine and - I'm not getting into that, I don't want to get into
that, organ harvesting and all this. We can do business the old way, we
still make a lot of money, make everybody happy, make movies, whatever
we do. [...]</p>

guard. You know, the Negev Brigade, and Ben-Gurion, and Avi
Braverman.</p>

class="quote">"Sending email to people who have intelligence backgrounds
in Europe does not make you an operative. I've never accepted any money
from Israel. And I wanted my kids to go serve in the IDF, which they
both disappointed me greatly by saying no. Basically because I thought
Israel needed military help a lot more than the US. No-one in their
right mind would attack the US, but we have 7 countries surrounding
Israel."</span> About five minutes later George Webb said <span
class="quote">"I just want to say that my 100% loyalty is to the United
States."</span> But if he wanted his kids to serve in the military of a
foreign country, then is not at least 1% of his loyalty to the foreign
country?</p>
<p>During an interview with Doug Haggmann in 2017, George Webb said:
<span class="quote">"What I disclosed to Dr. Corsi tonight was that I
was a member of the - what informally was known as the WikiLeaks network
- which is an up-down network - and you don't know - in a blind network,
you don't know when you're passing down drives. You don't know anything
more than your downstream and your upstream. You don't know anything
more than where you're getting the thumb drive from, and where you're
getting it to, and you don't know what's on the thumb drive."</span>

Then Hagmann asked Webb: <span class="quote">"You were part of the
WikiLeaks transfer of information personally?"</span> And Webb answered:
<span class="quote">"Yeah, so yes, it was. So, before WikiLeaks was even
formed, there was an RT network, before the RT was even formed, there
was a network of getting information between New York and London. And
what you would do is basically thumb drives in Central Park is what I
would call it. But there were people that were not getting published in
Europe that needed to be published in the United States. So it was thumb
drives would come this way from people, writing - basically authors or
dissidents - coming to New York. And then there was a branch going the
other way first, mainly South American journalists that
[unintelligible], this was mainly through the Czech embassy in New York,
that's my experience, so I don't have any more experience than that. But
this isn't new, this isn't new, and WikiLeaks was formed after that. And
some thumb drive drops in Central Park are not new. And that's how it
works. And you know, I new, I mean, I actually met Julian Assange in
Australia in 1984 when he was a kid. And he is a piece of the puzzle,
but he's not the whole puzzle. It's bigger than Julian Assange, and I'll
just leave it at that."</span></p>
<p>Patricia Negron (Trish the Dish) used to be featured in the
livestreams that Jason Goodman did with George Webb. During an interview
with Albert Bishai in 2020, she said: <span class="quote">"Someone asked
if George Webb is an operative. And he definitely is some kind of an
operative. Because one of the things I learned during this lawsuit was
George kept trying to file to intervene - which drives up the costs for
anyone who's involved - and so, he's filing all this shit again and
again and again - and one of the things that he filed was a
certification for the Department of Homeland Security, level 3, that he
apparently got - I looked at the dates - during the time that I was
doing livestreams with him and Jason. And he never mentioned any of
this. He would always say, he's going over to his son's house, or
somewhere to meet with someone or something. He was doing this training
program with Department of Homeland Security."</span>

<p>Butowsky and George Webb are both connected to respected journalist
Seymour Hersh, who claimed to have inside FBI sources about the <span

George Webb &amp; co (although according to Ed Butowsky Hersh claimed
his FBI source was George's nemesis, disgraced FBI Deputy Director
Andrew McCabe - which makes the relationship between Webb and Hersh
highly suspicious).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb claims to have known Julian Assange since he was a
teenager, and to have been a participant in delivering information to
WikiLeaks by giving thumb drives to Michael Ratner, Ellen's late
brother. He did this from the Harvard Club at dinner with Jerome Corsi
and Jason Goodman, calling into the Hagmann Report. Sadly Doug Hagmann's
son and #PizzaGate reporter Joe died suddenly just after Isaac Kappy and
just before Tracy Twyman.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb attended some of Epstein's parties in New York. His
former room-mate was a US Secret Service agent who secretly videotaped
some of these events. [I don't know what Outtrim's source was, and I
don't know if he used the term <span class="quote">"secret

protecting the president.]</p>

<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb claims to be a proud Zionist and ally of Mossad - but
<span class="quote">"old"</span> Mossad, French Mossad. He is seeking
<span class="quote">"a little of bit of compromise, a little bit of drug
trafficking, a little bit of organ harvesting"</span>.</p>
<p>George Webb claims to have many connections in and much knowledge of
the intelligence community. I have been in touch with one of his closest
sources over the past couple of years, who is indeed part of the
intelligence community, inter-generationally. George also claims to be
friends with James Alefantis and to have been involved with human
trafficking in the Balkans in the 90's, and that he was personally
targeted by FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe after being compromised in
BDSM sessions with porn star Janine Lindemulder.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb and Jason Goodman both appear to speak fluent Russian.
Jason Goodman was married to a Ukrainian and was CEO of a drone company
Aerocine, famous for flying high-definition camera drones over
Chernobyl, Ukraine around the time of the Maidan Revolution. Jason
Goodman's former social media director is now running a drone company
with a board almost entirely made up of IDF leaders. One of the worst
cyber virus attacks in modern history originated out of Ukraine in 2017,
targeted at the Maersk Shipping Line the same month they became victims
of CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER - a different kind of cyber-attack launched
in America featuring George, Jason, Trish and Dr Corsi.</p>

<p>In an interview with Kerry Cassidy in 2017, George Webb said that he
had knowledge of two instances where Trump was compromized by Epstein.
Webb also said that he <span class="quote">"roomed with a gal who worked
the Trump parties - the Epstein-Trump parties"</span>. But it's not
clear if Webb went to the parties himself, or if he heard about the
parties from the girl or from some other source:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=iFxnxWCBu6I</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Trump is just really - so I've known him a long time. I was
involved in - like you mentioned - the Franklin case, tangentially. The
Paul Rodriguez who broke the Franklin story in 89 worked for The
Washington Times. And I tried to get a story to him in 2002. I passed
him some information in 2003, but he never wrote the story. And then he
died of cancer at a young age. I think he was a great journalist. And
sometimes, you know, there's a lot of bloody footprints in this
business.</p>
<p>But Trump was one of the Epstein Brownstone operations in 1993. It
was two incidents. One was kind of a lead-up incident, and then the
other one was - but it was - he didn't know how old - I mean, I'm just
gonna say this. This is history. He didn't know how old the girls were.
The girl - he didn't know how old the girl was at the time. So this is
the kind of dirt they had on Trump, and that Epstein had on Trump.</p>
<p>And I think Trump is best off saying, look, you know, it was 1993
that that happened, and I didn't know. And Jeff, you were the one who
had a CIA operation, or you had a DynCorp operation with 12 cameras.
You're the one who put that girl in the room, and brought her in from
Kosovo or Bosnia, or wherever you bought her in from. I think there's
more than enough blame to go around here. And I'm not gonna have my
presidency compromised by that - by those two incidents.</p>
<p>So I roomed with - I was in New York in 2002 and 2003. I roomed with
a gal who worked the Trump parties - the Epstein-Trump parties. She was
a caterer. She was a model and everything at other times, but she did
that. They did Long Island parties, and they did these parties on the
Upper West Side, where Jeff Epstein's stone fortress is up there.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a good - the parties had a beginning, and a
middle, and an end. The partiers would come in, and there was - it was
kind of handshakes, and Bloomberg, and Trump and everybody. In the
middle, it's kind of a lull, where all the waitresses disappeared, and
the waiters disappeared, and then they'd come out in their new costumes,
and then everyone would go, <span class="quote">"oops, this is getting
crazy, I'm leaving."</span> And then there would be the kind of like
entendres that would occur after that, where there was these rooms that
were set up and they were being filmed.</p>
<p>What Trump always came in for like five minutes. Some model, had his
picture taken, took a couple - shook a couple hands, and he would leave.
He didn't - he wasn't the, oh my god, I have to stay here and, lurk, and
you know, troll, for some kind of -. He was always with some beautiful
model. And he probably went to - I'm gonna guess - thirty Jeff Epstein
parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a Periscope livestream in 2017, George Webb said the following:
[<a href=https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynKOjWpwBVxR?t=10m55s>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>pscp.<wbr>tv/<wbr>w/<wbr>1ynKOjWpwBVxR?<wbr>t=10m55s</a>,

<blockquote>
<p>So, let me - I was talking about Mossad earlier. So, so, I didn't
know that these people that were presenting themselves - little bit at a
time - <span class="quote">"Oh, I'm just a diplomat. Oh, I'm just
actually, uh, well, actually I had some intelligence background way back
when. Oh, actually, um, I did a few operations. Oh, well, I might still
do occasional stuff for blah blah blah. Oh, yeah, actually I am French
intel."</span> That kinda procedure. And this happened to me with the
Dutch. And now I'm just - I'm gonna let everybody know right now, I used
to work with the Dutch in New York. So it wasn't Russia. And I did
drops. [...] But, then, I had one from Germany. And they're always - I
don't know why they always use women, but they're always these brilliant
women. [...] They always go with the kind of Madam Curie types that end up
approaching me. [...] There was a time at the Plaza Hotel with the German,
back in 2001-2002. That's how I knew the caterer who went over there to
CFR. That's how I had the CFR info, ok. [...] I wasn't a genius on the
Long Island Serial Killer. That came from the Epstein stuff that I did,
from my roommate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next at time 16:45, George Webb listed several of his intelligence
contacts, and he hinted there were intelligence people behind him making
him smarter: <span class="quote">"So anyway, the intelligence links. So
that was the French link. There's a British gal. Guess who? I'm not
gonna say. And anyway, there's a Serbian gal, here's a gal from Kosovo,
they're all women. [...] There's one other one that I, well, I'm not gonna
say that one. So, but anyway, when you start way smarter than your IQ,
there's a good chance there's an intelligence person behind you making
you smarter."</span></p>
<p>Next at time 18:44 when Jason Goodman asked how Israel is so in
control even though it's such a tiny country, Webb used the pronoun
<span class="quote">"we"</span> to refer to Israel: <span
class="quote">"Because they know how to - I mean we know how to
co-operate [?] sources. I mean, that's the key. And, and, in defense of
Israel - and, you know, I almost went into the - uh, I have regrets in
my life, in that last phone call, when I thought the cleanup guys who
were going to take care of it, I was also - I was gonna go into the,
<span class="quote">'Oh, my son didn't go into the IDF'</span> - I know
I've told you that before - <span class="quote">'my daughter wouldn't go
to the IDF. I know he's a doctor, but I'm really ashamed that he didn't
go into the IDF.'</span>"</span> Then Jason Goodman asked Webb: <span
class="quote">"Did you live in Israel?"</span> Then Webb answered: <span
class="quote">"No, no, no, I never went into Israel. Uh, but anyway, a
lot of people I worked with in New York way back when were from that
network, so you're gonna find that. I'm just trying to prove out the
intelligence links without giving anything up."</span></p>
<p>In a video clip that was posted by Defango on Steemit, Webb said:
<span class="quote">"I'm not Republican or a Democrat, I'm a Berniecrat
- but anyway - and Jewish, so that's - I'm always rooting for Mossad,
secretly, kind of. And this is what that is."</span>
[<a href=https://steemit.com/news/&#x40;defango/george-webb-and-this-mossad-homies>https://<wbr>steemit.<wbr>com/<wbr>news/@<wbr>defango/<wbr>george-<wbr>webb-<wbr>and-<wbr>this-<wbr>mossad-<wbr>homies</a>,
<a href=https://streamable.com/mm6v3>https://<wbr>streamable.<wbr>com/<wbr>mm6v3</a>]
When he said he was always secretly rooting for Mossad, it was hard to
tell if he was joking or serious or both.</p>
<p>In 2023 George Webb tweeted: <span class="quote">"@Hageulah Mossad
connected is not Mossad payroll. I had three Mossad informants in 2017
who gave me their tups in writing over proteon mail. Those records can
be subpoened."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/RealGeorgeWebb1/status/1673727422036844545>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>RealGeorgeWebb1/<wbr>status/<wbr>1673727422036844545</a>]
Next he replied: <span class="quote">"@MHageulah Should have been tips.
Sorry. I really had it laid out for me with the Mossad MO in America in
2017 by several folks who were married to diplomats in three different
countries."</span>

<p>In 2023 someone tweeted: <span class="quote">"During the 2016
election Webb admitted on live stream he's working for Israeli
intelligence."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/fennougrian/status/1675952421028151298>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>fennougrian/<wbr>status/<wbr>1675952421028151298</a>]
But George Webb replied: <span class="quote">"Nope, just some folks that
claimed to be Mossad sent me intel about Braverman."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/RealGeorgeWebb1/status/1675981998077116420>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>RealGeorgeWebb1/<wbr>status/<wbr>1675981998077116420</a>]</p>
<p>George Webb might be a Messianic Jew, because he posted a tweet where
he said: <span class="quote">"For my birthday today, I am declaring a
Jihad on Cancer. I am a Christian, but you get the idea."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/RealGeorgeWebb1/status/1712429066211500314>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>RealGeorgeWebb1/<wbr>status/<wbr>1712429066211500314</a>]
And when someone replied <span class="quote">"I thought you were a
jewish convert"</span>, George Webb replied: <span
class="quote">"Judeo-Christian. Heavy on the Christian."</span></p>
<p>In the court case in 2019 where Robert David Steele sued Jason
Goodman for 24 million USD for defamation, Steve Outtrim presented the
following testimony:
[<a href=https://trackingmeroz.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/rds-doc-82.pdf>https://<wbr>trackingmeroz.<wbr>files.<wbr>wordpress.<wbr>com/<wbr>2019/<wbr>03/<wbr>rds-<wbr>doc-<wbr>82.<wbr>pdf</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December 2018, I interviewed a former collaborator of Jason
Goodman on my podcast (Exhibit H - Queen Tut Spills the Beans). Susan
Lutzke aka Queen Tut has been named as a codefendant in this lawsuit and
has also been named as a co-conspirator by Defendant Goodman (doc. no.
78). She appeared on dozens of shows on Jason Goodman's channel and
contributed research to him. During this interview (Exhibit H), she
disclosed that Jason Goodman's source <span class="quote">"Deep
Uranium"</span> aka <span class="quote">"Rock Hudson"</span> aka <span
class="quote">"Mr Hudson"</span> was actually an FBI
informant/provocateur named Okey Marshall Richards, Jr. He was working
in close collaboration with Jason Goodman and his accomplice George Webb
Sweigert in their <span class="quote">"Clear and Present Danger"</span>
disinformation operation to shut down the Port of Charleston.</p>
<p>Queen Tut further revealed connections between Mr. Goodman and
Aerocine, a corporation that listed Mr. Goodman as the CEO. Aerocine
flew advanced imagery drones over the Chernobyl nuclear site near Kiev,
Ukraine, a couple of weeks before the Maidan Revolution broke out there.
See Exhibit I (Goodman CEO of Aerocine), Exhibit J (Goodman presentation
on Ukraine drone flight as CEO of Aerocine, two (2) weeks after Maidan
Revolution). Mr. Goodman was married to a Ukrainian and appears to speak
fluent Russian (Exhibit K).</p>
<p>The involvement of Russians and Ukrainians on social media channels
in <span class="quote">"active measures"</span> disinformation
operations, smear campaigns, gang-stalking, and cyber-attacks is of
great concern to me. The large number of former CIA, FBI, and military
intelligence guests on Mr. Goodman's channel all tell similar stories
that are highly critical of the United States government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a book published in 2006 called <span class="quote">"Towers
of Deception"</span>, which may have served as an inspiration for Webb
and Goodman's Charleston dirty bomb hoax, because the book starts out
with a fictional scenario where an Iranian suitcase nuke blows up in the
port of Charleston.

<p>During an interview with Addy Adds in 2020, George Webb said: <span
class="quote">"My brother was the journalism guy. He was - he did a lot
of stuff in journalism, people don't know that - but he was really
accomplished in journalism. And I kind of just picked it up from him. I
didn't have any training in journalism. [...] I have three older brothers
and that's my next older brother, who also was in the military and
Panama, and he had a lot of experiences from the military. And so I've
learned a lot from him. He worked at a lot of government agencies - so
like NSA and different agencies - so, as a contractor. So I learned a
lot. He was very much in this Washington, DC world of, you know, needing
a clearance and all that stuff."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/QR9pZaIXyGya>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>QR9pZaIXyGya</a>,
4:06] Then Addy asked: <span class="quote">"And he's retired
now?"</span> And Webb said: <span class="quote">"I think he's still
doing special projects for different health companies and stuff like
that, I think."</span></p>

<p>Jason Goodman hit the big time when he linked up with George Webb,

George Webb to Dr Jerome Corsi. Corsi
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSO6EEzQby4>fed George with

<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDAZ3pF9jIw>part of the
WikiLeaks network</a>, that he used to participate in thumb-drive drops
in parks where he gave information to Mike Ratner (died 5/11/16) who
passed it on to John Jones (died 8/16/16). Dead men can verify no tales.
George also said that he met

he was texting back and forth with Jerome Corsi all the way through the

<blockquote>
<p>I applaud your subpoena of Jerome Corsi. I first encountered Corsi in
1995 when he orchestrated a fraud for which Minneapolis FBI agents
sought to frame me - after I returned from Baghdad in February 1997
with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>evidence of no WMD, (2) an offer from the senior-most sheikhs to
remove Saddam Hussein without a war (to which Saddam reportedly agreed),
and (3) an offer to provide U.S. firms with the bulk of the contracts
for reconstruction and oil. Rather than engage me in good faith (federal
law then prohibited my travel to Iraq), colleague Munther Ghazal and I
were stalked by agents within both the FBI and the DIA, including Mossad
operatives posing as FBI agents, as chronicled in the accompanying
exhibits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jerome Corsi is the first person from whom I heard the phrase <span
class="quote">"preparing the mind"</span> when he oversaw a fraud
designed to discredit me in Poland at a time when the Knesset was
predominantly Polish. That fraud was financed by Carl Lindner whose
website then boasted that he was the largest non-Jewish contributor to
Jewish causes in the U.S. I urge that you immediately engage the
documentation provided. My life experience proves the common source of
ongoing geopolitical duplicity, including the narrative-advancing role
played by Corsi.</p>
<p>To portray Corsi as a conspiracy theorist misses the point. He is
either an Israeli agent or a wellpaid asset of the Jewish state. Ask him
about me. Better yet, subpoena me, Munther Ghazal, Ron Burd, my attorney
since 1992, and Jeff Gates, a colleague since 2002. Let us provide
questions to ask Corsi. Note how, while I was in London, I outed him as
a Mossad operative, per the blue-tabbed material. He knows what he did -
and for whom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 2020 Jerome Corsi launched a telehealth website called
SpeakWithAnMD.com, where he raked in millions dollars by selling
prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin. A
report on the website said: <span class="quote">"America's Frontline
Doctors (AFLDS) - a leading purveyor of coronavirus misinformation -
refers patients to SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that SpeakWithAnMD.com
provides phone consultations with <span class="quote">'AFLDS-trained
physicians'</span> willing to prescribe hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,
and other unproven treatments. According to recent reports, AFLDS
referred over 255,000 individuals to SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16,
2021, and September 12, 2021 - approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for
initial phone consultations and many of whom had follow-up consultations
for an additional $60."</span>

So the initial consultation fees add up to about 6.5 million USD, even
though it was over a period of less than 2 months through a single
referrer alone. AFLDS was run by the Jew Simone Gold, who previously
worked as the assistant to Michael Oren, who was the Israeli ambassador
to the United States, and who was named by the Jerusalem Post as one of
the ten most influential Jews in the world.

<p>The three products that were initially promoted on Corsi's telehealth
website were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc, which are the
three components of the Zelenko protocol. Corsi's website offered
prescriptions for HCQ and azithromycin, but his website had a
partnership with an online pharmacy called Bonsa Health which shipped
the drugs and which I guess also sold zinc.

Peter McCullough has coauthored multiple papers with the Morgellons guru
Raphael Stricker, whose medical board issued a complaint against him in
2019 because he prescribed ivermectin as a treatment for Morgellons
disease without obtaining informed consent.

A case study from 2011 described the case of a man who had earlier
thought he was poisoned by the Japanese mafia, but then he learned about
Morgellons disease from the internet, so he started to think he had
Morgellons instead, and he bought ivermectin in bulk from an online
veterinary supplier, so he ended up developing ivermectin toxicity.

Goodman's fight with Paul Cottrell</a>
</h3>
<p>In April 2020 George Webb's brother Dave Acton reported that Jason
Goodman had declared a cyber war against Cottrell, because Cottrell
appeared on Michael Decon's radio show together with Thomas
Schoenberger:

<blockquote>
<p>In a dramatic turn of events, <span class="quote">"Hollywood film
maker"</span> Jason Goodman has in so many words declared a so-called
cyber war on <span class="quote">"Doctor"</span> Paul Cottrell. In sum,
now Goodman is insinuating that Cottrell is a member of a <span
class="quote">"social engineering"</span> team or is a <span
class="quote">"social engineer"</span>.</p>
<p>Cottrell simply states that he believes COVID-19 is a bio-engineered
virus for scientific purposes that can be traced to 2008.</p>
<p>The use of the term <span class="quote">"social engineer"</span> is a
stock term Jason Goodman allegedly applies to members of the <span
class="quote">"decentralized distributed defamation"</span> social media
engineers associated with Thomas Schoenberger (Shadowbox Strategies). A
social media podcast featuring a Thomas Schoenberger interview with
<span class="quote">"Dr."</span> Paul Cottrell has surfaced.</p>
<p>Jason Goodman (alleged friend of Brian Singer) has accused
Schoenberger (in court documents) of operating with a group of joint
tortfeasors (<span class="quote">"gang"</span>) made up of Manuel
Chavez, III, Carson City, Nevada, and George Webb (Sweigert), Cobb
Island, Maryland. Goodman believes that Schoenberger and Webb are
working secretly with Robert David Steele, Oakton, Virginia.</p>
<p>In the video below, Jason Goodman launches into a profane litany of
swear words. In fact, Goodman tells Cottrell that <span
class="quote">"he will never be a medical doctor"</span> and that he is
a <span class="quote">"threat to society"</span>, etc. These seem to be
stock Goodman phrases as they riddle court documents in Virginia and New
York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jason Goodman published a video of his argument with Paul Cottrell
over the phone, but the video sounded like both of them were actors
playing a role, and they were both acting in an exaggeratedly aggressive
manner.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/8aAnVACgQ8sI/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>8aAnVACgQ8sI/<wbr></a>]
A week later Goodman published a similar confrontational phone call he
had with Cameron Kyle-Sidell, where Goodman kept saying the pandemic was
fake and that Kyle-Sidell was falsely hyping up the pandemic, but at the
end of the call Kyle-Sidell hung up after Goodman asked him: <span
class="quote">"have you ever been involved in a simulation with Colleen
Smith or not?"</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/gAB5LWHRoBY/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>gAB5LWHRoBY/<wbr></a>,
24:35]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-sidell-cotrell.jpg width=800>
</div>
<p>The same day when Jason Goodman posted the video about his fight with
Cottrell, he also posted one video he did with Jerome Corsi, another
video he did with the so-called former CIA agent Kevin Shipp, and
another video about a phone call with a nurse from the frontlines:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-goodmanapril.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>The former CIA counterterrorism expert Kevin Shipp used to be a
regular guest on Goodman's channel. Goodman frequently accuses his
adversaries of being <span class="quote">"social engineers"</span>, but
one time Shipp told people to subscribe to Jason Goodman's Patreon
channel, because it would defeat the social engineers who were coming
after Goodman:
[<a href=https://x.com/Kevin_Shipp/status/1148985156268679169>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Kevin_<wbr>Shipp/<wbr>status/<wbr>1148985156268679169</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/earlynews-kevin-shipp.webp width=750>
</div>
<p>Both Cottrell and Goodman posted videos of phone calls they
supposedly did with people from the frontlines of the COVID response,
even though I don't know if some of the people were just actors.</p>
<p>Jason Goodman also published a phone call he did with Colleen Smith,
who was the star of a viral video about Elmhurst Hospital in Bronx. When
people discovered that Colleen Smith was an expert in medical
simulation, Jason Goodman, flat earthers, and Qtards presented it as
evidence that her video was simulated and the pandemic was fake.

<p>In May 2020, Jason Goodman told John Cullen: <span class="quote">"I
feel very confident that some of these doctors I've been questioning for
the past few months - Colleen Smith, Cameron Kyle-Sidell, this nurse
Nicole Sirotek - who I have not been able to reach despite her claims
that she's trying to get her word out and she can't - all these people I
believe have been engaged in a social engineering scheme that was
designed to funnel money into the New York Health and Hospital
System."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/-NITQYi83sY>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/-<wbr>NITQYi83sY</a>,
18:58] So basically Goodman was saying that Cottrell, Colleen Smith, and
Cameron Kyle-Sidell were all social engineers.</p>
<p>Webb and Goodman were part of a WWE fighting circuit where an endless
series of fights was staged between members of the circuit, so then
conspiracy researchers wasted their time following the fights instead of
doing something productive, like how Robert David Steele sued Jason
Goodman, George Webb sued Jason Goodman, George Webb's brother sued
Jason Goodman, George Webb sued Robert Malone, and so on. So it's
suspicious that Paul Cottrell was also pulled into their scheme of
interlocking fights.</p>

<p>In spring 2020 there was a trend where people posted videos from
empty hospitals to show that the COVID pandemic was fake. The person who
started the trend may have been Jason Goodman. His YouTube had a
playlist for videos he shot from various hospitals, and he tweeted that
<span class="quote">"I think I may have visited more hospitals than
anyone else, at least that I'm aware of"</span>.

<p>His earliest video about empty hospitals I found was posted on March
17th UTC.

In the video he said the coronavirus was <span class="quote">"the
cronyvirus"</span>, he talked about an article by Jon Rappoport who
claimed that PCR tests were inaccurate, and he interviewed people
outside a hospital who said they were not yet seeing many COVID
patients. The next day on March 18th, he posted another video titled
<span class="quote">"NYC Ghost Town - Where's Viro? Day 2 Hunting
Covid-19 at New York Hospitals During Pseudo Pandemic"</span>. His tweet
about the video said <span class="quote">"I continue my ongoing search
for even a single EMT, Dr or Hospital admin with direct firsthand
knowledge of a #COVID19 patient"</span>.

<p>When I searched Twitter for early videos from empty hospitals, I
didn't find a single video earlier than Goodman's video from March 17th
UTC. One of the earliest videos I found was posted by someone from
Ireland on March 27th UTC, but a user who replied to the tweet posted a
video by Jason Goodman and pointed out that hospitals were also empty in
New York.
[<a href=https://x.com/Jimcorrsays/status/1243622117289136128>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Jimcorrsays/<wbr>status/<wbr>1243622117289136128</a>]</p>
<p>On March 27th UTC, Robert David Steele posted a video where he said:
<span class="quote">"There's also a lot of fakery then. For example in
New York City they're talking about morgues and emergencies and bodies
overflowing, and citizen journalists going there are finding zero.
Zero."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/CRffTaPc3Cs/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>CRffTaPc3Cs/<wbr></a>,
2:12] By citizen journalists, he may have meant Jason Goodman, who
called himself a citizen journalist, and who traveled to various
locations shooting Periscope videos about stories he covered.</p>
<p>On March 29th UTC which was about 12 days after Goodman's first video
from empty hospitals, the hashtag <span
class="quote">"#FilmYourHospital"</span> was started by DeAnna Lorraine,
who tweeted: <span class="quote">"Just went to 2 hospitals in LA to
check out these <span class="quote">'War Zones'</span> the MSM keeps
telling us about. They are very quiet &amp; EMPTY. We are not being told

<p>DeAnna Lorraine now has a show on the Stew Peters Network. The former
SPN host Jane Ruby also calls herself a citizen journalist, and she
wrote a book about citizen journalism that she dedicated to Andrew
Breitbart, whose protege Lee Stranahan was the person who introduced the
citizen journalist George Webb to the citizen journalist Jason Goodman.
When Malone sued Jane Ruby for 25 million USD for defamation, he was
represented by Steven Biss, who also represented RDS when RDS sued
Goodman for 24 million USD for defamation.</p>

Goodman's videos about COVID with Ole Dammegård</a>
</h3>
<p>In early 2020 Jason Goodman did many videos about COVID with Ole
Dammegård, including a video in February 2020 where Dammegård said that
COVID was caused by 5G.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=csthetruth%20dammegard%20until%3A2020-5-1>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=csthetruth%<wbr>20dammegard%<wbr>20until%<wbr>3A2020-<wbr>5-<wbr>1</a>]
The earliest big names in alt media I found who said that COVID was
caused by 5G were Mark Steele, Robert David Steele, Greg Reese, and the
flat earther Richie from Boston. A lot of the 5G crowd later started to
say that viruses are not real, including David Icke, Ole Dammegård (who
is the David Icke of Sweden), and Max Igan (who is the David Icke of
Australia). Many early no-virus people were flat earthers, and in
January 2020 Max Igan also did a video where he said that the earth was
flat. [<a href=novirus.html>novirus.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>After the flat earther David Weiss's website
deepinsidetherabbithole.com had become inactive, the URL of his website
used to get redirected to Ole Dammegård's website.
[<a href=http://mileswmathis.com/interview.pdf>http://<wbr>mileswmathis.<wbr>com/<wbr>interview.<wbr>pdf</a>]
On April 1st UTC, Dammegård published a blog post about a video where
Aajonus Vonderplanitz said that viruses are soap that is produced by the
human body to clean out debris, but the same video had been mirrored to
BitChute a week earlier by David Weiss.
[<a href=https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-only-way-to-get-a-virus-is-to-be-injected-with-it/>https://<wbr>lightonconspiracies.<wbr>com/<wbr>the-<wbr>only-<wbr>way-<wbr>to-<wbr>get-<wbr>a-<wbr>virus-<wbr>is-<wbr>to-<wbr>be-<wbr>injected-<wbr>with-<wbr>it/<wbr></a>,

In July 2020 Ole Dammegård and David Weiss appeared as guests together
on Jason Goodman's YouTube channel.
[<a href=https://x.com/csthetruth/status/1282691413721792512>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>csthetruth/<wbr>status/<wbr>1282691413721792512</a>]</p>
<p>I believe the first 4 people in alt media who interviewed Andrew
Kaufman were James True, Crrow777, Secrets of Saturn, and Richie from
Boston, who are all flat earthers. Andrew Kaufman's first viral video
was a clip from his presentation that was livestreamed by the flat
earther James True, who called himself Kaufman's <span
class="quote">"lead writer"</span>, and who said that he had emptied his
Patreon account on producing and promoting Kaufman's videos.

The original livestream on March 31st UTC didn't get as many views as a
clip of the video that was published a few days later. However Ole
Dammegård's blog had a post dated March 31st about the original
livestream, even though up to that point I believe all of Kaufman's
appearances in alt media had been on flat earth channels, and there's
only a handful of references to him on Twitter before April 2020.

In May 2020, Goodman and Dammegård did an interview with Andrew Kaufman,
which Goodman said was <span class="quote">"one of the best
conversations I've heard about #covid_19 #pandemic"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/LightOnConspira/status/1259854845646901248>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>LightOnConspira/<wbr>status/<wbr>1259854845646901248</a>,

Goodman, Weiss, and Kaufman are all Jews from the New York area.</p>
<p>In 2020, Jeran Campanella and David Weiss hosted a livestream where
Jason Goodman debated whether the earth was flat with Rose777, who is
the wife of Crrow777 who I believe was the second person in alt media
who interviewed Kaufman.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMEl0u174o>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=krMEl0u174o</a>]
David Weiss said: <span class="quote">"So, um, I've been, you know,
seeing Jason's videos for a long time, but then at the beginning of the
protests, the lockdown, I caught one of Jason's streams where he was
walking through Brooklyn and really standing up for New York, standing
up for truth, and it blew me away. I immediately became a Patron, and
I've watched almost every show he's done ever since. He does shows with
Ole Dammegård a couple times a week or once a week on Monday. And uh,
he's really doing important work."</span> [1:27] Even though Goodman
argued against the flat earth theory, I believe he was still working for
the same side as the flat earthers behind the scenes. Jim Fetzer also
did a similar debate against David Weiss in 2015, even though Feter is
transparently controlled opposition, and he later became a no-virus guy

Goodman's video with early COVID survivor John Mark Dougan</a>
</h3>
<p>On March 21st 2020 UTC, Jason Goodman posted an interview he did with
the former American cop John Mark Dougan, who defected to Russia and now
lives in Russia.</p>
<p>Dougan told Goodman that <span class="quote">"I got tested one week
ago"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6qfuOcebagU/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>bitchute.<wbr>com/<wbr>video/<wbr>6qfuOcebagU/<wbr></a>,
11:10] On OWID the cumulative number of cases in Russia is updated only
weekly, but it was 34 on March 15th, so Dougan could've been around the
30th COVID case in Russia if he got tested a week before March 21st.</p>
<p>At the start of the video, Dougan said: <span class="quote">"About
three weeks ago I went to immigration, and there were a bunch of Chinese
people there. They actually kicked me out cause they were all wearing
masks. And they told me not to come back until I got a mask. And I went
back the next day, still a ton of Chinese people had a mask. And I
didn't feel anything for at least a week. So about a week later, I woke
up, I was tired, I didn't feel that great, but I just figured out, <span
class="quote">'ok whatever'</span>, you know. And then I started feeling
good again, and then I felt like pretty bad again. So I wound up calling
the doctor, and they sent over the coronavirus people."</span> The first
confirmed case in Russia was on February 28th and the second case was on
March 2nd. So if Dougan is not lying, which doesn't seem very likely,
then he may have even been the second COVID case in Russia by the date
of case onset.</p>
<p>He showed this photo of people in hazmat suits who are supposed to
have come to his apartment building to test him:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-douganearly.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>There's only about 20,000 Chinese people in Russia, so it's
convenient that Dougan happened to come in contact with Chinese people
in a country where there's almost no Chinese people.</p>
<p>Several other people also claim to be early COVID survivors,
including Steve Pieczenik who claims that he had the first case of COVID
in the United States, and Kevin McCairn who claims that he got COVID
from the Korean superspreader event in November or December 2019, even
though the event only occurred in February 2020.

<p>In September 2022 John Mark Dougan published a fake RAND Corporation
memo, which he claimed was leaked to him by someone from Germany. The
memo said that the secret purpose of the war in Ukraine was to weaken
Germany.
[<a href=https://redpill78.substack.com/p/newly-leaked-report-from-rand-corporation>https://<wbr>redpill78.<wbr>substack.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>newly-<wbr>leaked-<wbr>report-<wbr>from-<wbr>rand-<wbr>corporation</a>]
However you can tell the memo was fake because it was poorly written and
formatted. The main text of the report was written in British English,
but the second page of the report used American spelling for the word
<span class="quote">"behavior"</span>. The second page appears to have
been copied from a real book published by the RAND Corporation, similar
to the book shown here:

There's 7 Kindle books where Addy is listed as the second author and
George Webb is listed as the first author, but I don't know if Addy was
actually the main author of some of the books.

I don't know if Addy meant that he was initiated by Webb to become a
member of some secret order, like The Most Excellent and Accepted Rite
of Citizen Journalists, or if his knighting had a more mundane
meaning.</p>
<p>Housatonic once said that Addy comes from a NATO family, but I don't
know if it was just speculation based on how Addy's family lived on US
military bases, because his parents don't actually seem to have a
military background.</p>
<p>Addy's bio from 2017 said: <span class="quote">"Although a Wisconsin
native, he graduated from high school in Guam after his mother accepted
an offer to teach middle school Spanish at the Naval base the summer

His family moved from Guam to Japan in 2017, and they later moved to
Rammstein in Germany.

Addy's father was a professional soccer player in Mexico, who later
worked as a network technician and a soccer coach, which doesn't seem
like a very Jewish background.

I have a hard time believing her Qtard audience would be such avid
readers. But Kindle books seem like an easy way to launder money,
because you don't even have to ship any physical product. The price of
the book has remained at 4.77 USD since 2021, so 37,000 copies would
amount to almost 200,000 USD. In 2020 Addy did a video in person with
Cirsten, who wore a shirt that said WWG1WGA. She said that Addy would
get 30% of the sales of the book.

At one point Qtard accounts seemed to be artificially amplified on

hung from a rope,"</span> according to the Daily Beast.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to her death, Weldon posted several short

<a href=#Fort_Detrick_theories_of_George_Webb_and_KGB id=Fort_Detrick_theories_of_George_Webb_and_KGB>Fort
Detrick theories of George Webb and KGB</a>
</h3>
<p>In early 2020, George Webb and Housatonic were speculating that
SARS-CoV-2 was created at Fort Detrick by Sina Bavari's team.
Housatonic's earliest video about COVID I found was about the Fort
Detrick theory.
[<a href=https://odysee.com/&#x40;Housatonic/ep-28-4-64>https://<wbr>odysee.<wbr>com/@<wbr>Housatonic/<wbr>ep-<wbr>28-<wbr>4-<wbr>64</a>]</p>
<p>Housatonic, McCairn, and O'Loughlin have done videos with Nick the
Spacecat, who is peddling the KGB's old disinformation theory that HIV
is an American bioweapon. [<a href=hiv.html>hiv.<wbr>html</a>]</p>
<p>In 1992 Russia's head of foreign intelligence Yevgeni Primakov
admitted that the theory that HIV was created at Fort Detrick was <span
class="quote">"concocted in the offices of the KGB"</span>. The same
year the former Stasi disinformation officer Günther Bohnsack admitted
that the theory was part of an active measure initiated by Moscow, but
the three people he credited for popularizing the theory were Jakob
Segal, Stephan Heym, and Johannes Mario Simmel, who were all Jews.</p>
<p>The main star of the KGB's campaign was Jakob Segal, who like Nick
and Len Horowitz said that HIV was created by Gallo at Fort Detrick, and
that HIV was a recombinant of visna and some other virus.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the CBS aired a report about Webb's theory on the
program 60 Minutes, but similarly in 1987, the CBS aired a report about
Segal's theory by the 60 Minutes host Dan Rather. Segal said that HIV
was a hybrid of the HTLV-1 and visna viruses, but Webb also said that
SARS-CoV-2 was a hybrid of three viruses. Segal was registered as an
informant at Stasi, but according to Trish the Dish who used to do
videos with Webb, Webb had acquired a level 3 certification at the
Department of Homeland Security (and DHS employed the former Stasi head
Markus Wolf, and the name of DHS is reminiscent of Stasi, which is short
for <span class="quote">"state security"</span> in German).</p>
<p>Segal had previously supplied the Stasi with intelligence on western
nuclear research, and one time he suggested his supervising officer at
the Stasi to stage a car accident to kill a scientist. Segal continued
to support Lysenko's view that genes did not exist even after Lysenko
himself had abandoned it. Segal's books were published by the publishing
house of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany. The director of the
publishing house coauthored a book with Segal, and he went on a speaking
tour in Africa promoting Segal's theory together with the Communist
Party of South Africa.</p>
<p>Jakob Segal was interviewed in the West German press by his close
friend Stefan Heym, who was a Jewish journalist who was earlier the
editor-in-chief of the German-language newspaper of Communist Party USA.
He served in the US Army's psychological warfare unit called the Ritchie
Boys, which was led by the Jew Hans Habe, who established numerous
newspapers in Germany after the war after the German press was
dismantled. Heym was an editor of one of the newspapers, which was
largely staffed by Jews who had served in the psychological warfare
division of the US Army. The Stasi disinformation officer Bohnsack also
said that the Stasi supplied material about HIV to the Jewish fiction
writer Johannes Mario Simmel, who wrote a popular novel about the theory
that HIV was created in Fort Detrick, which was later turned into a
movie.</p>
<p>Nick claims that HIV is a product of recombination between the SIV
and visna viruses, but he has been unable to tell me which parts of the
genome of HIV come from visna, and I have shown him that no part of the
genome of HIV is closer to visna than to SIV. He told me that <span
class="quote">"I've seen there are 12 genes in HIV from Visna"</span>,
even though HIV only has 9 genes.
[<a href=https://x.com/pizzapicklespur/status/1835335880049037801>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>pizzapicklespur/<wbr>status/<wbr>1835335880049037801</a>]
Nick uses the word <span class="quote">"fusion"</span> to refer to
genomic recombination of viruses, so as evidence for his recombination
hypothesis, he keeps presenting a paper titled <span
class="quote">"Visna virus-induced fusion of continuous simian kidney
cells"</span>, even though the paper is about visna-induced syncytium
formation of host cells, where the word <span
class="quote">"fusion"</span> refers to host cells merging together into
a cell with multiple nuclei, and not to recombination of two different
species of viruses.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=syncytium+from:henjin256&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=syncytium+<wbr>from:<wbr>henjin256&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
Nick said that the area of <span class="quote">"recombinant DNA"</span>
that created HIV is <span class="quote">"referred to as fusogenics, or
fusion products"</span>, even though both terms refer to the fusion of
the HIV envelope protein with the host cell, which has nothing to do
with the genomic recombination of two species of viruses.

<p>The earliest person I have found who presented the visna
recombination theory is John Seale, who was soon followed by Jakob Segal
and Robert Strecker. Seale said that two articles in the Soviet magazine
Literaturnaya Gazeta <span class="quote">"led me to consider seriously
the circumstantial evidence that the Aids virus might have been
man-made"</span>.
[<a href=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1290430/pdf/jrsocmed00187-0068b.pdf>https://<wbr>pmc.<wbr>ncbi.<wbr>nlm.<wbr>nih.<wbr>gov/<wbr>articles/<wbr>PMC1290430/<wbr>pdf/<wbr>jrsocmed00187-<wbr>0068b.<wbr>pdf</a>]
The author of the first article said that about 90% of the staff of
Literaturnaya Gazeta were Jews, and the former Soviet
counterintelligence agent Oleg Kalugin said that Literaturnaya Gazeta
was <span class="quote">"our prime conduit in the Soviet press for
propaganda and disinformation"</span>.
[<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926203029/http://inforing.net/publications/infopress/culture.php?ELEMENT_ID=44648>https://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20200926203029/<wbr>http://<wbr>inforing.<wbr>net/<wbr>publications/<wbr>infopress/<wbr>culture.<wbr>php?<wbr>ELEMENT_<wbr>ID=44648</a>,

The KGB's story about HIV was also promoted by the DC-based magazine
CovertAction Information Bulletin, whose figurehead was the former CIA
agent Philip Agee, who communicated with the KGB through the London
correspondent of Literaturnaya Gazeta.
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR41>https://<wbr>books.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>books?<wbr>id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&amp;<wbr>pg=PR41</a>]
Out of the 8 people who were listed as founders of CAIB, 3 were former
CIA agents, at least 4 of the remaining 5 people were Jews, and the 5th
person I'm not sure of was married to one of the Jews.
[<a href=hiv.html#Selvage_and_Nehrings_2014_German_book>hiv.<wbr>html#<wbr>Selvage_<wbr>and_<wbr>Nehrings_<wbr>2014_<wbr>German_<wbr>book</a>]</p>
<p>In 1982 Literaturnaya Gazeta published a Webbian piece of
investigative journalism, where the author wrote that he traveled from
Moscow to DC to visit an editor of CAIB, who gave him leaked CIA
documents that led him on an investigative trail to Pakistan, where he
discovered that the Pakistan Malaria Research Center was actually a NATO
bioweapons lab that was creating weaponized mosquitoes. The story was
only missing encrypted Blackberries and a nuclear deal.

<p>Len Horowitz was knighted by the Russian branch of the Knights of
Malta, which was transplanted to the United States in the late 1800s.

One of the knights was the UFO disinformationist Colonel Philip J.
Corso, another knight was the Chief of Research and Analysis at the CIA,
and another knight served as the Imperial Director of the Klan Bureau of
Investigation, which was the counterintelligence unit of the KKK.

<p>I used to think that Housatonic got connected to George Webb in 2020
because they were doing the same type of research on COVID, because they
both speculated that SARS-CoV-2 was created in Fort Detrick by Sina
Bavari's team. However Housatonic was talking to George Webb on Twitter
before COVID, and in 2019 before Housatonic had his own YouTube channel,
he did his alt media debut on John O'Loughlin's channel.
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1130150776016396293>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>leytedriver/<wbr>status/<wbr>1130150776016396293</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/HousatonicLive/status/1742404612819210380>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicLive/<wbr>status/<wbr>1742404612819210380</a>]
In February 2019, O'Loughlin tagged Housatonic and Webb in a tweet where
he wrote: <span class="quote">"This is yesterday's Live at National
Harbor, where George and I decide to launch a McDuff channel on Youtube!
Exciting!
<a href=https://pscp.tv/GeorgWebb/1gqxvngrypkxB>https://<wbr>pscp.<wbr>tv/<wbr>GeorgWebb/<wbr>1gqxvngrypkxB</a>"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1100400815032934404>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>leytedriver/<wbr>status/<wbr>1100400815032934404</a>]
So George Webb was involved in launching the YouTube channel where
Housatonic did his alt media debut. When Webb lived in the DC area, he
did a a lot of videos in person with O'Loughlin, who is a retired lawyer
who was a member of the DC Bar Association. O'Loughlin's father was a
high-level FBI agent.</p>
<p>George Webb is always talking about nuclear deals or nuclear energy,
but nuclear energy was one of the topics that Housatonic was focused on
before COVID, and for example in 2019 O'Loughlin tagged Webb and
Housatonic in a tweet where he wrote: <span class="quote">"Mark Kulacz
has identified Uranium's value as an energy storage medium. Now
Kazakhstan has the world's only IAEA approved Uranium bank!"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1171849929427472384>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>leytedriver/<wbr>status/<wbr>1171849929427472384</a>]</p>
<p>Lyme disease is another topic Housatonic was focused on before COVID,
but O'Loughlin has done many videos about Lyme disease with Adam
Finnegan, and O'Loughlin narrated an audio version of Finnegan's book
about Lyme disease. George Webb also started promoting Finnegan's book
soon after the book was published. The foreword to the book was written
by Finnegan's mentor John Loftus, who provided Project Paperclip files
to Finnegan that Finnegan used as source material in his book, and who
was previously the main proponent of Finnegan's theory that Lyme disease
is caused by a biowarfare agent created by Erich Traub. Loftus is a
former military intelligence agent, Nazi hunter, and director of a
Holocaust museum. He organized an annual intelligence conference in DC
called The Intelligence Summit, whose advisory council included two
former heads of the CIA, Michael Aquino's commanding officer at the 7th
PSYOP Group, and senior Israeli intelligence officers. The conference
was bankrolled by the Israeli gangster Michael Cherney, who organized a
similar intelligence conference in Israel, and who was involved in a
massive money laundering operation where Russian assets were transfered
to the US secret economy. Loftus coauthored his books with a Jew whose
father was the head of the Communist Party of Australia. Loftus
fabricated a story about a secret Belarusian Holocaust, which he claimed
was based on the memoirs of a Jew called Sol Schiadow who had given the
memoirs to the FBI three decades earlier, but which had remained unknown
until Loftus discovered them in underground vaults near DC. As evidence
for his theory about Lyme disease, Loftus cited communication with
anonymous former spies, and a <span class="quote">"top-secret
study"</span> that <span class="quote">"once existed, but all copies
have been destroyed"</span>.

However after the citizen journalists Goodman and Webb, the third person
in alt media I found who interviewed Bergy was Mark Kulacz, who calls
himself a citizen journalist.
[<a href=https://altcensored.com/watch?v=OOUGRf91O1o>https://<wbr>altcensored.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=OOUGRf91O1o</a>]
I believe the first two guests on Housatonic's channel were John
O'Loughlin who is the son of a high-level FBI agent, and Patrick Bergy
who worked as a cyberwarfare expert for the military contractor
Dynology.

There were almost no references to Bergy on Twitter until late 2019 when
he appeared several times on Jason Goodman's YouTube channel, but after
that some of the earliest references to him on Twitter are about his
interviews with George Webb and Housatonic.
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=until%3A2020-1-1+%22patrick+bergy%22&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=until%<wbr>3A2020-<wbr>1-<wbr>1+%<wbr>22patrick+<wbr>bergy%<wbr>22&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]
Bergy is one of the few people in alt media who has done an interview
with Thomas Schoenberger, and Bergy has even used Schoenberger's music
as background music in his livestreams, which is interesting considering
Cottrell's connection to Schoenberger.

I'm not sure if the sequence of events proposed by Couey correct,
because Kulacz didn't do the video about Hillary's emails until 2019,
but he was already talking with George Webb on Twitter in 2017:

</div>
<p>However Housatonic did post a Twitter thread about the emails in
2018, and in the thread he quoted a tweet from 2017 by a user called
Truthingov2016, so in case Truthingov2016 was his old account, he might
have started posting about the emails on Twitter before he was in
contact with George Webb.</p>

<p>Edward Snowden was not employed directly by the NSA, but he was
employed as an NSA contractee first at Dell, and later at Booz Allen

worked as the <span class="quote">"lead technologist on Dell's CIA

class="quote">"expert in cyber counterintelligence"</span>.

Snowden's story was that he gained access to the documents he leaked
while he worked at Dell. Snowden's PR guru worked as the campaign
manager of Couey's boss.</p>
<p>Before Housatonic worked for Dell, he worked as a competitive
intelligence analyst for a company called Datto, which made the news in
2015, when the FBI retrieved a backup server of Hillary's emails that
was managed by Datto.</p>
<p>In 2019 Housatonic came out as a whistleblower about Datto's role in
the email scandal. He said that the story that Hillary's email server
was run out of an old bathroom closet was false, and actually the email
server was managed by Datto, and in October 2015 the server was
personally retrieved from a data center by Peter Strzok from the FBI.
However I don't understand what his big revelation was supposed to be,
because most of what he said had been public information since 2015, and
his claim that Peter Strzok personally retrieved the server seems to
have been based on speculation in a thread by an anonymous Twitter
user.</p>
<p>Peter Strzok is a frequent character in George Webb's stories, and
Webb says that Strzok's father had an integral role in the Iran nuclear
deal.

<p>Hillary's emails and DNC emails were one of the main subjects that
George Webb covered before COVID, and they were also the main topic of
the 4chat posts by FBIAnon, who was the predecessor of Qanon.
[<a href=https://paulfurber.net/pdf/fbianon.pdf>https://<wbr>paulfurber.<wbr>net/<wbr>pdf/<wbr>fbianon.<wbr>pdf</a>]
The official story was that the DNC emails were leaked by Russian
hackers, but some people claimed the emails were leaked by Seth Rich,
who is supposed to have gained access to the emails while he worked as
IT staff for DNC. George Webb had an original theory that a part of the
leaked files were released by Eric Braverman, who was the CEO of the
Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>George Webb built up a much of his early following by covering the
Seth Rich story, and Jason Goodman and George Webb came up with what
Steve Outtrim calls the <span class="quote">"who spoofed the Seth Rich
files LARP"</span>.
[<a href=https://burners.me/tag/seth-rich/>https://<wbr>burners.<wbr>me/<wbr>tag/<wbr>seth-<wbr>rich/<wbr></a>]
George Webb was first introduced to Jason Goodman by Lee Stranahan, who
claims that he also introduced Guccifer 2.0 to Roger Stone. Wikipedia
says: <span class="quote">"During the 2016 US presidential election,
while working for Breitbart News, Stranahan communicated with Russian
hackers via Guccifer 2.0 to leak illicitly obtained material about the

<p>There's a French intelligence company called Avisa which specializes
in online influence operations. A journalist who worked for Avis asaid
that after an international cancer agency declared glyphosate to be a
carcinogen, he was tasked by Avisa to write articles which discredited
the agency.
[<a href=https://www.franceinfo.fr/economie/medias/enquete-avisa-partners-dans-les-coulisses-de-la-sulfureuse-agence-d-influence_6035825.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>franceinfo.<wbr>fr/<wbr>economie/<wbr>medias/<wbr>enquete-<wbr>avisa-<wbr>partners-<wbr>dans-<wbr>les-<wbr>coulisses-<wbr>de-<wbr>la-<wbr>sulfureuse-<wbr>agence-<wbr>d-<wbr>influence_<wbr>6035825.<wbr>html</a>]
Avisa also coordinated campaigns to discredit invididual people, which
sounds similar to the reputation management services that were offered
by Thomas Schoenberger's ShadowBox company. Avisa described themselves
as a <span class="quote">"global risk and reputation management
firm"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avisa-partners-acquires-top-intelligence-firm-to-bring-comprehensive-global-investigations-offering-to-clients-301678930.html>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>prnewswire.<wbr>com/<wbr>news-<wbr>releases/<wbr>avisa-<wbr>partners-<wbr>acquires-<wbr>top-<wbr>intelligence-<wbr>firm-<wbr>to-<wbr>bring-<wbr>comprehensive-<wbr>global-<wbr>investigations-<wbr>offering-<wbr>to-<wbr>clients-<wbr>301678930.<wbr>html</a>]
Avisa created fake journalist personas, complete with fake LinkedIn
profiles and fake employment records, and Avisa operated at least three
fake news sites.
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avisa_Partners>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Avisa_<wbr>Partners</a>]
In 2023 Avisa won a contract from the European Commission to write
anti-disinformation briefs. Avisa also organized a cybersecurity
conference together with the French National Gendarmerie. The Wikipedia
article about Avisa says that <span class="quote">"In addition to
cybersecurity, Avisa Partners carries out competitive
intelligence"</span>. So it's interesting how Avisa combines
Housatonic's field of competitive intelligence with ShadowBox's field of
reputation management.</p>

<p>Mark Kulacz said that he started the Housatonic ITS company because
he needed to create a fictional company while he worked at Datto: <span
class="quote">"I needed to create a fictional company for one of the
last two jobs that I had. And what the heck, just for fun, just for

the time Datto, serviced managed service providers - and I didn't even
know what an MSP was at that time - so I set up the company fictionally,
you know, I set up a little website, Google account, etc. And had some
fun with it, if you will, as a product marketing director at Datto, and
I also did some work as their first competitive intelligence director,
although they really didn't know exactly how to use the role
effectively."</span>

<p>He didn't explain why he needed to create the fictional company. His
Housatonic ITS company is supposed to offer affordable backup services
to citizen journalists, but I always thought it seemed like a weird
business. Who many clients has he ever had? How many citizen journalists
are there who need affordable backup services? Wouldn't they more
comfortable just using some standard off-site backup application, or
wouldn't they be afraid that Kulacz could see their files?</p>
<p>I found an old snapshot of the website of Housatonic ITS from 2018,
but the website didn't say that the company was fictional.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20181014163827/https://sites.google.com/a/housatonicits.com/home/>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20181014163827/<wbr>https://<wbr>sites.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>a/<wbr>housatonicits.<wbr>com/<wbr>home/<wbr></a>]
However one thing that stands out on the website is that the company not
only had a Twitter account but also a Gab account:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-housatonic-archive.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>At first I thought that if Kulacz created the company under the
auspices of his employer, then would he want the company to be connected
to his controversial political posts on Gab? However actually his Gab
account seems to have just been a mirror of his Twitter account, but
even then, it seems like a weird account to be connected to a fake
company that Kulacz was somehow required to create as part of his
job.</p>
<p>The Gab account was active from 2018 until May 2019. I didn't find
any mention of the company being fictional on the Gab account. The bio
of the account said: <span class="quote">"Small New England IT managed
services provider (MSP) for nonprofits. Storage. #Backup #NAS
#Networking #SharePoint Twitter @ HousatonicITS #MAGA"</span>.
[<a href=https://gab.com/HousatonicITS>https://<wbr>gab.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicITS</a>]
I didn't see any posts about backup services on the Gab account, and I
didn't even see any post about the Housatonic ITS company, but most
posts on the account were about political or conspiracy topics:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-housatonic-archive-2.jpg width=800>

<p>The Gab account also has a retweet about a Q drop:</p>
<div>

<p>So was there some point at which Housatonic ITS turned from a
fictional company to a real company? Or has the company ever had even a
single client?</p>

the whistle about Hillary's emails</a>
</h3>
<p>In April 2019 Mark Kulacz posted a video where he said the following:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf%2d%5fjI>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/<wbr>watch?<wbr>v=xTpvuAf%<wbr>2d%<wbr>5fjI</a>

<blockquote>
<p>There was an accidental backup of Hillary Clinton's emails to an
offsite backup server. That whole picture that you see regarding the
email backups - and like in a bathroom server - that thing is a total
hoax. It is not true, it's not the truth.</p>
<p>The specific situation is that there was a backup device, a physical
backup device from Datto Corporation used. It was paid for by the
service provider that Hillary Clinton was using. And that system was
making essentially hourly full disk image backups of her email server to
an offsite location.</p>
<p>A disk image backup is one where the entire image of the disk,
including all of the blocks that are on the disk drives - the solid
state drives, whether it be a solid state or a mechanical hard drive,
everything - all the metadata, all the files, system metadata,
everything necessary to reconstruct that system is backed up on hourly
basis. That means that even if the data is logically deleted - well, you
know what, unless the data is actually scrubbed - even if the data is
scrubbed on the disk, there are backup copies and backups have a
retention of up to several years.</p>
<p>So even though Hillary Clinton's email server was bleached bitted,
even though that was the case, several years each hourly backup is going
to be maintained. And before they did the bleached bit, the logical file
deletions of the emails - those - that data would have been backed up as
well. This stuff is all backed up to shared servers, which have a
certain number of clients, which are in the cloud that Datto Corporation
was maintaining.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that - and that was digging in through some,
one of those FBI reports. I happened to notice that there was a guy in
there named Peter Strzok. I thought it was just bad handwriting or
something. S-T-R-Z-O-K. And I started doing some digging. This is
around, let's see here, 2017. And it appears as though Peter Strzock was
called in to handle the situation as part of that whole FBI probe. And
you can actually go through the documents for yourself and ensure enough
back on October - make sure I got the date here - October 5th or October
6th, he and several other people went to the offsite data center and
physically picked up the actual physical server that had those backup
copies on it. Ever since October 2015, the FBI has had <em>the</em>
server with <em>the</em> backup copies on it.</p>
<p>You can look at the FBI file, you can look at the serial number of
the system, it's a 36-drive system, I believe the manufacturer would
have been a super micro.</p>
<p>Of course, this means that all of the data that's on that system from
other companies, which of course would have had the backup to it because
these are our shared systems, would have also had their data unknowingly
confiscated and owned and in position - in possession of - the FBI would
have had that data in their possession. How awful is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However I don't understand what his big revelation was supposed to
be, because the story that the FBI acquired the backup server from Datto
had been public information since 2015. An article by Daily Caller from
October 2015 said:
[<a href=https://dailycaller.com/2015/10/06/employees-at-hillarys-it-company-worried-they-were-being-asked-to-cover-up-shady-st/>https://<wbr>dailycaller.<wbr>com/<wbr>2015/<wbr>10/<wbr>06/<wbr>employees-<wbr>at-<wbr>hillarys-<wbr>it-<wbr>company-<wbr>worried-<wbr>they-<wbr>were-<wbr>being-<wbr>asked-<wbr>to-<wbr>cover-<wbr>up-<wbr>shady-<wbr>st/<wbr></a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employees at the Denver-based IT company that Hillary Clinton hired
in 2013 to manage her private email network expressed concern that they
were <span class="quote">"covering up"</span> something <span
class="quote">"shady."</span></p>
<p>That's according to a letter sent Monday by Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron
Johnson to Austin McChord, the CEO of Datto Inc., a Connecticut-based
computer cloud storage company.</p>
<p>According to Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and
Government Affairs Committee, a Clinton family company called the
Clinton Executive Services Corp. hired the Denver company, Platte River
Networks, on May 31, 2013 to oversee Clinton's private email network.
Platte River in turn hired Datto to create a virtual backup server of
Clinton's emails.</p>
<p>During most of her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton used a
server that she housed in her Chappaqua, N.Y. home. But data from that
device was transferred to a Datto server controlled by Platte River,
which housed the new hardware at a New Jersey data center.</p>
<p>The FBI seized that server in August after the Intelligence Community
inspector general discovered that Clinton aides had sent her two <span
class="quote">"top secret"</span> emails. Clinton has claimed that she
did not send or receive classified information on her server.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Johnson's letter also provides evidence that Datto may have copies of
Clinton emails, raising hopes that the records could be compared to the
55,000 pages of documents Clinton turned over in December. Clinton has
said that she has turned over all of her work-related emails, though
many observers have questioned the claim.</p>
<p>The FBI has already reportedly recovered some data from Clinton's
server, despite claims she and her attorney have made that no
information exists on the hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought that the new information Kulacz revealed might
have been that the server was personally seized by Peter Strzok. However
in a Twitter thread in 2018, Kulacz had already mentioned the theory
that the server was retrieved by Strzok:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20180120165625/<wbr>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>HousatonicITS/<wbr>status/<wbr>954173497168875520</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-1.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>The source he cited was a Twitter thread from 2017 by a user called
TruthinGov2016, who showed that Strzok had signed the letter from FBI to
Datto where FBI requested handing over the server, which according to
the Twitter user made it <span class="quote">"HIGHLY likely Strzok was
the last person to touch the physical server that had some (even most)
of the only remaining copies of the lost 33,000 emails"</span> (even
though I don't understand how that follows from Strzok having signed the
letter, or why it would even be relevant if the server was personally
retrieved by Strzok or not):
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180126013331/https://x.com/TruthinGov2016/status/945016245803470848>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20180126013331/<wbr>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>TruthinGov2016/<wbr>status/<wbr>945016245803470848</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-2.jpg width=600>

<p>Kulacz included the hashtags <span class="quote">"#Qanon"</span> and
<span class="quote">"#TheStorm"</span> at the end his Twitter
thread:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-3.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In the YouTube video, Kulacz said that he started doing digging on
Strzok's involvement with the emails around 2017, but the tweet by
TruthinGov2016 was posted in 2017, so I don't know if TruthinGov2016 was
Housatonic's old account.</p>

<p>In a Twitch stream on March 1st 2023 UTC, Couey wore a t-shirt which
featured the logo of Mossad and the text <span class="quote">"SINCE

a collection of designs which express love for the state of Israel:

<p>JC didn't say anything about the t-shirt during the stream, and he
didn't explain why he wore the shirt. However he may have worn the shirt
to troll Kevin McCairn, because two days before JC's stream, McCairn did
a stream about a paper by J. Bart Classen, who wrote that Mossad was
behind COVID.

At that point JC had been in a streaming war with McCairn for a few
months after McCairn and Rixey called out his clone theory as nonsense.
But why would JC have bought the Mossad t-shirt in the first place? And
what was the point that he just wore the t-shirt on the stream without
ever explaining why he wore it?</p>
<hr />
<p>Added later: I said on Twitter that JC may have worn the Mossad
t-shirt in order to troll McCairn, because two days earlier McCairn did
a stream where he suggested Mossad was behind COVID, but JC replied that

[<a href=https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/>https://<wbr>h<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>v<wbr>a<wbr>r<wbr>d<wbr>t<wbr>o<wbr>t<wbr>h<wbr>e<wbr>b<wbr>i<wbr>g<wbr>h<wbr>o<wbr>u<wbr>s<wbr>e<wbr>.<wbr>com/<wbr>2020/<wbr>01/<wbr>31/<wbr>logistical-<wbr>and-<wbr>technical-<wbr>analysis-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>origins-<wbr>of-<wbr>the-<wbr>wuhan-<wbr>coronavirus-<wbr>2019-<wbr>ncov/<wbr></a>]</p>

<p>Dan Sirotkin went to college on an NSA scholarship, and as of 2024 he
still lived in the DC area, where the headquarters of various
intelligence agencies are located.
[<a href=https://www.harvard2thebighouse.com/p/the-sars-cov-2-pandemic-begins-and>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>harvard2thebighouse.<wbr>com/<wbr>p/<wbr>the-<wbr>sars-<wbr>cov-<wbr>2-<wbr>pandemic-<wbr>begins-<wbr>and</a>]</p>
<p>Dan Sirotkin tweeted: <span class="quote">"As half Askenazi Jew and
half Cajun, I can't imagine how those white devils sleep at night!!
🤣"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1425424404591284231</a>]
He also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Wonder if us Jews get free
bagels..."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1222165786304880640>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1222165786304880640</a>]
He also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Where do I start with the
quarter-to-three-quarter Jew privilege?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1298767738811318272</a>]
However he probably gets his Jewish ancestry from his father's side
because he tweeted: <span class="quote">"My last name means <span
class="quote">'orphan'</span> in both Ukrainian and Russian because my
paternal great-great-grandfather had to be hidden in a Catholic
orphanage in Gomel so he didn't end up as the Tsar's cannon-fodder,
since he was a Jew."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>Harvard2H/<wbr>status/<wbr>1603861877993476097</a>]
So his father Karl Sirotkin might be a full Jew.</p>
<p>In the first video Couey did about COVID, he discussed blog posts by
the Sirotkins, James Lyons-Weiler, and Vincent Racaniello, but Couey's
second video about COVID was dedicated to the blog post by the
Sirotkins:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/&#x40;JConabike/videos>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>youtube.<wbr>com/@<wbr>JConabike/<wbr>videos</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-couey.jpg width=700>
</div>
<p>In 2021 Couey tweeted a link to his old YouTube video where he
discussed the blog post by Dan and Karl Sirotkin, and he wrote: <span
class="quote">"Before DRASTIC existed, there was an original duo...Dan and
his dad. And then I found them, and we became three. DRASTIC was after
this."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/jjcouey/status/1401262466978488320>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>jjcouey/<wbr>status/<wbr>1401262466978488320</a>]
So after a partially Jewish former NSA counterterrorism analyst and his
likely fully Jewish father, Couey was basically the third member of
proto-DRASTIC.</p>
<p>On Charles Rixey's list of DRASTIC's key breakthroughs, the first
entry is about the blog post by Dan and Karl Sirotkin, the second entry
is that JC started posting YouTube videos about COVID in February 2020,
and the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th entries are about work done by Yuri
Deigin.
[<a href=i/drastic-key-breakthroughs.jpg>i/<wbr>drastic-<wbr>key-<wbr>breakthroughs.<wbr>jpg</a>]
But Deigin also said that he is half Jewish.
[<a href=https://x.com/ydeigin/status/1396928014454304770>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>ydeigin/<wbr>status/<wbr>1396928014454304770</a>]</p>
<p>Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Even crazier when you realize
that my first ever live streams of any kind were invites to join Paul
Cottrell of Operation George Webb, Addy Ads of Operation George Webb,
and McCairn...five weekends in a row. McCairn had a solo stream with
Ads-Webb one week before. All in on it."</span>

<p>It's interesting that Webb said that he used to work with Dutch
intelligence in New York, because Webb used to be the sidekick of Jason
Goodman whose current sidekick John Cullen speaks Dutch, or at least he
has posted several tweets in Dutch:
[<a href=https://x.com/search?q=from%3AI_Am_JohnCullen%20lang%3Anl&f=live>https://<wbr>x.<wbr>com/<wbr>search?<wbr>q=from%<wbr>3AI_<wbr>Am_<wbr>JohnCullen%<wbr>20lang%<wbr>3Anl&amp;<wbr>f=live</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-cullen-dutch.jpg width=480>
</div>
<p>Here John Cullen said in a Couey-like fashion that COVID origins is a
red herring, but as evidence he posted a clip of his interview with the
counterterrorism expert Tau Braun, who says that the calamari clots
consist of tissue that was programmed to grow snake venom glands by
nanobots, and who supposedly discovered that COVID was caused by snake
venom about half a year before Bryan Ardis:

<p>Couey worked as a research scientist at Erasmus Medical Center in
Rotterdam from 2012 to 2016.

Webb wrote a book about bioweapons research at the EMC, and he says EMC
is one of NATO's main bioweapons development centers.

John Cullen's YouTube channel was initially focused on the mass shooting
at Las Vegas, but in 2023 Webb was the main person in alt media who
covered a mass shooting at the EMC.

The head of the EMC's department of viroscience is Marion Koopmans. The
deputy head of the department is Ron Fouchier, who led one of the most
famous publicly acknowledged gain-of-function experiments, where the
H5N1 avian influenza virus was adapted to mammals through serial passage
in ferrets. The first documented case of MERS was described by
Fouchier's team at Erasmus, who also published the reference genome of
MERS-CoV.</p>

<p>Alex Jones keeps talking about how the globalists are always trying
to recruit him to their side, like how one time he traveled to NYC to
meet with David Rothkopf who was the head of Kissinger Associates, and
who invited Alex to join their side, but he refused the offer. And Alex
Jones says that he keeps receiving offers to join secret Illuminati
parties but he always refuses the offers (even though actually he's
probably going to parties at DUMBs where he's sacrificing children to
Xenu with George Soros).</p>
<p>In a stream where JC was talking about how Andrew Huff is probably
controlled opposition, JC said that he has been offered some <span
class="quote">"weird opportunities"</span> that he has never followed
through with: <span class="quote">"That's what I think we're dealing
with here - is people that are willing to lie very consistently and
precisely about things in order to advance their personal position in
the invisible hierarchy that is at play. And I have not - I have been

And I wonder if some of these other people have just been offered these
opportunities and followed through with them."</span>

<p>So has Couey really not followed through with the weird
opportunities? And in any case, he received a monthly salary of 7,000
USD from CHD according to Charles Rixey, or 5,000 USD according to
another source, so I wonder if it came with some strings attached. And
even though Couey is supposed to have been fired by the CHD, he might
still be getting funded covertly through similar channels that fund
CHD.</p>

<p>Couey said that his boss at the University of Pittsburgh was a
Captain in the US Navy, who had a security clearance that required him
to take special precautions: <span class="quote">"The guy that I worked
for has a special background. He was at the time an active Navy -
whatever is underneath Captain - on a submarine. And so he did ROTC and
then went to Harvard and did his postdoc at Janelia farms. And so he was
like a Navy officer, nuclear sub-trained guy - like hardcore, that's the
highest level of technology in the government as far as I know is
nuclear subs - and he was a guy who got promoted during my time there to
Captain, although he wasn't active anymore. And actually, at some point
right before, right during the start of the pandemic was threatened to
be shipped to Africa, to work on some kind of anti-pirate thing. And so
there was talk about how I might take over the lab for a year. [...] This
guy has security clearance that sometimes he locks his door for."</span>

<p>The DEFUSE proposal document was originally released on the website
of Billy Bostickson, who is supposed to have received the document from
Major Joseph Murphy via McCairn's Marine sidekick Charles Rixey. Murphy
supposedly found the document in a <span class="quote">"top-secret file
within DARPA's Biological Technologies Office"</span> while he was a
<span class="quote">"Marine Corps officer working with the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency"</span>, but afterwards he went to
work for the Office of Naval Research.

<p>One of McCairn's memetic warriors on Twitter is RexesRule, who has
made many meme-style images where she promotes McCairn, and who
frequently asks people to donate money to McCairn. She used to work for
a unit of naval intelligence called NAVSECGRU, which later became the
Information Operations Directorate of Naval Network Warfare Command.

<p>One of Thomas' collaborators was a political PR strategist called
Trevor Fitzgibbon. Trevor used to be president of relatively prominent
<span class="quote">"liberal"</span> media firm, then fell foul of a
sexual harassment scandal in 2015. To deal with the fallout he adopted a
two-pronged approach for some of the women who came forward - tying them
up in court with <span class="quote">"lawfare"</span>, and trolling them
and their associates online.</p>
<p>For the trolling, we have Thomas and his associates. And for the
lawfare, we introduce the legal services of Tanya Cornwell, and her
husband, SLAPP-happy attorney Steven Biss - who also represented Kash
Patel, Svetlana Lokhova, Tim Holmseth, Dan Bongino, and Mike Flynn's
<span class="quote">"best friend in DC"</span>, congressman Devin
Nunes.</p>
<p>In 2016, Trevor helped create #Unity4J, ostensibly as a way to build
support for Julian Assange. This thing appears to have been a
significant <span class="quote">"cross-pollinating"</span> event,
bringing people from opposite sides of the political spectrum together,
under the guise of <span class="quote">"government transparency"</span>,
and attempting to poison progressives with conservative conspiracies.
Legends like Australian Greens' Senator Scott Ludlum were sharing a
platform with people like Cassandra Fairbanks, Jimmy Dore, Kim Dotcom,
and our favourite former Naval Intelligence Officer, Jack Posobiec.</p>
<p>Trevor also appears to do PR for some of the jabronies in the VIPS,
including Bill Binney, Ray McGovern, and the adrenochrome aficionado and
major Q-promoter himself, mister Robert David Steele, who was also using
the two-pronged approach of Thomas &amp; Tanya to fight his own dumb
squabbles.</p>

<p>When I searched for Trevor Fitzgibbon's name on BitChute, there were
6 search results, which were all interviews he had done on TNT Radio.

TNT Radio is now defunct, but they hosted radio shows by several
advocates of a multipolar world order, like Matthew Ehret, Hrvoje Moric
from Geopolitics and Empire, Jerm Warfare, and Patrick Henningsen.</p>
<p>In 2022 TNT Radio launched a news site called The Intelligencer,
which was still in operation in 2025 when I wrote this. As of January
2025, The Intelligencer had published 63 articles, but almost half of
them had the author listed as Trevor Fitzgibbon.
[<a href=https://intelligencer.today/category/news/>https://<wbr>intelligencer.<wbr>today/<wbr>category/<wbr>news/<wbr></a>]
The Intelligencer was managed by George Eliason, who is an American
journalist who has lived in Eastern Ukraine for a long time, and who had
a show on TNT Radio.</p>
<p>The editorial board of The Intelligencer includes Lee Stranahan, who
introduced George Webb to Jason Goodman, and who is supposed to have
introduced Guccifer 2.0 to Roger Stone.
[<a href=https://intelligencer.today/editorial-board/>https://<wbr>intelligencer.<wbr>today/<wbr>editorial-<wbr>board/<wbr></a>]
The board also includes Roger Stone's personal attorney Tyler Nixon, a
Russian filmmker who has collaborated with Oliver Stone, a former
chairwoman of an organization called Serbs for Trumb, and an advisor to
the head of the Luhansk People's Republic:
[<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/intelligencer-pro-russia-website-trump>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>theguardian.<wbr>com/<wbr>us-<wbr>news/<wbr>2024/<wbr>sep/<wbr>19/<wbr>intelligencer-<wbr>pro-<wbr>russia-<wbr>website-<wbr>trump</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working alongside contributors for Kremlin state media, the former
Donald Trump policy aide George Papadopoulos, his wife, Simona
Mangiante, and others have become editorial board members of the website
Intelligencer, which is increasingly becoming a source of news for those
in the rightwing ecosystem.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Although much of the website's content focuses on issues relating to
American politics, the site actually began in Australia, with a
little-known media outlet called TNT Radio, which launched in 2022. Show
hosts and guests frequently deny climate change, discuss culture war
issues in the US, espouse pro-Russian viewpoints on the war in Ukraine,
and spread conspiracy theories about Covid-19.</p>
<p>Jennifer Squires, one of the station's owners, explained in an
interview that Intelligencer began as a way for TNT Radio to have a
written publication to complement its radio station. To develop the new
site, Squires said she turned to George Eliason, an American journalist
who has lived in eastern Ukraine for more than 10 years. Eliason, who
already had a show on TNT Radio at the time, has formerly appeared on RT
and blames Kyiv for the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Nearly half of Intelligencer's board members are either former aides,
surrogates or fake electors for Trump's previous two campaigns.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known ex-Trump official is Papadopoulos, who
served as a foreign policy aide on Trump's 2016 campaign. In 2018, he
pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a
Kremlin-linked professor who told him Russia had dirt on Hilary
Clinton.</p>
<p>Mangiante, his wife, has written several posts for the site about
debunked conspiracy theories involving the Bidens and Ukraine. In
January, she posted an interview with a former Ukrainian lawmaker,
Andrii Derkach, who repeated false claims of bribery about the Biden
family in Ukraine. In 2020, the US placed sanctions on Derkach, calling
him an active Russian agent; Derkach, who now is running for political
office in Russia, previously met with Rudy Giuliani and purported to
offer evidence of corruption against the Bidens.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Mangiante, along with fellow board member Igor Lopatonok, appears to
have parlayed this work into a new documentary about the Hunter Biden
laptop saga called Hunter's Laptop: Requiem for Ukraine. According to
social media posts, the documentary premiered on 5 September at the
Trump International hotel in Chicago. Eliason wrote the script, which
was filmed by Lopatonok, who has frequently collaborated with Oliver
Stone on prior anti-Ukrainian documentaries and fawning films of
dictators.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Mr Lopatonok wanted fresh eyes from an
investigative journalist and a different perspective for the
story,"</span> Eliason said. <span class="quote">"Through the combined
interviews, we were able to plumb deeper and raise questions that had
not been asked before."</span></p>
<p>Eliason also said that the address listed on Intelligencer's website
was provided by Lopatonok.</p>
<p>Lopatonok did not respond to requests for comment. However, he now
appears to have implemented part of his business in Moscow. According to
Russian corporate records, Lopatonok and his wife, Vera Tomilova, also
an Intelligencer board member, registered a Global 3 Pictures LLC in
Moscow in February.</p>
<p>According to invitations for the Hunter Biden documentary premiere,
the event was hosted by the Christian Orthodox Coalition, an
organization which claims to educate Orthodox Christians on social and
cultural issues. Four of the organization's board members are also board
members of Intelligencer, including Papadopoulos, Mangiante and
Lopatonok.</p>
<p>The fourth board member is Olga Ravasi, who was formerly the
chairwoman of Serbs for Trump in 2020 and currently runs the Serbian
American Voters Alliance political action committee. In March,
Intelligencer posted about a Serbs for Trump kick-off event in Wisconsin
with the state's Republican senator Ron Johnson and former Trump acting
director of national intelligence Ric Grenell.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Tyler Nixon, Roger Stone's personal attorney, also serves on the
board and hosts his own show on TNT Radio. The former Radio Sputnik
journalist Lee Stranahan is also involved.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Most of the site's content appears to be created by Eliason, and
Trevor Fitzgibbon, who was the spokesperson for American Values 2024, a
Super Pac that supported Robert F Kennedy Jr's presidential campaign.
The website has several posts promoting Kennedy's campaign.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, the site has even more direct ties to Russia beyond its
content. One of its board members is Anna Soroka, an adviser to Leonid
Pasechnik, the head of the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic. In
February 2023, the US sanctioned Pasechnik, calling him the <span
class="quote">"Putin-appointed interim head of the former so-called
Luhansk People's Republic"</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee Stranahan's brother Ken worked for Jason Goodman's company 21st
Century 3D. The Wikipedia article about Lee Stranahan says: <span
class="quote">"Stranahan met Andrew Breitbart while working on
assignment in 2010. The two men soon became friends, and Breitbart
converted Stranahan to conservatism, became his mentor, and hired him to
work at Breitbart News.[4] Stranahan has also described Steve Bannon,
the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, as being his
mentor.[7]"</span>
[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Stranahan>https://<wbr>en.<wbr>wikipedia.<wbr>org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Lee_<wbr>Stranahan</a>]
Jane Ruby named her book about citizen journalism after a speech by
Breitbart, and she dedicated the book to the media warriors who were
following on the path laid by Breitbart.

The main financier of Breitbart News was the Jewish billionaire Robert
Mercer, who had earlier financed Bannon's films.

<p>When Malone sued Peter Breggin, Ginger Breggin, and Jane Ruby for

previously represented Robert David Steele when RDS sued Jason Goodman
for defamation for 24 million USD.</p>

The term <span class="quote">"fifth-generation warfare"</span> may have
been coined by Robert David Steele, because in a book titled <span
class="quote">"The Handbook of Fifth-Generation Warfare"</span>, there
is a timeline which describes the origins of the term <span

entry is about a press release by Robert David Steele from 2003.

<p>In 2018 Biss represented Trevor Fitzgibbon when Fitzgibbon sued
Snowden's lawyer Jesselyn Radack for defamation, but the court ruled in
Fitzgibbon's favor and ordered Radack to pay him about 100,000 USD.

CNN aired footage of him and Mike swearing an oath of allegiance which
included the phrase <span class="quote">"where we go one, we go
all"</span>, but Jack Flynn claimed that CNN falsely presented him as a
follower of Qanon and the oath wasn't related to Q.</p>
<p>In 2019 Biss represented Svetlana Lokhova when she sued Stefan Halper
for 25 million USD for defamation. Halper had accused her of being a
Russian spy and having an affair with Mike Flynn in order to compromise
Flynn on behalf of Russian intelligence.

<p>In 2020 Biss filed a subpoena on behalf of the congressman Devin

called DevinCow, which made fun of Devin Nunes.

<p>A website of Cicada 3301 has a list of their alumni which includes
three people, who are Bruce Cooper Clarke Jr. who was the director of
the Office of Strategic Research at the CIA, Iona Miller who is a
researcher of St. Germain, and Ian Murdock who created Debian Linux.

<p>Iona Miller's old website had a page about the Middle Pillar, which
included an article she and her husband wrote about the <span
class="quote">"Middle Pillar Exercise"</span>.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20040405084107/http://zero-point.tripod.com/cosmictime.html#RE-VISIONING%20MIDDLE%20PILLAR%20EXERCISE>http://<wbr>web.<wbr>archive.<wbr>org/<wbr>web/<wbr>20040405084107/<wbr>http://<wbr>zero-<wbr>point.<wbr>tripod.<wbr>com/<wbr>cosmictime.<wbr>html#<wbr>RE-<wbr>VISIONING%<wbr>20MIDDLE%<wbr>20PILLAR%<wbr>20EXERCISE</a>]
Iona Miller's website also had a page for Israel Regardie's kabbalistic
art.

Her husband Richard Alan Miller also recommended people to read a book
about the Tree of Life by Israel Regardie.

<p>In the article I linked above, David Cherubim wrote: <span
class="quote">"The well-known Golden Dawn magician Francis Israel
Regardie regarded the Middle Pillar as containing the secret of the
Great Work. He considered the Middle Pillar Exercise as being of utmost
value, not only to the aspirant but to the Adept as well. Such was his
high regard for the Middle Pillar Exercise that he even used it to
initiate certain aspirants."</span> He also wrote: <span
class="quote">"The Middle Pillar is integration; it is the point of
equilibrium between the two Pillars of the Tree of Life; it is the point
of balance between the two extremes or polarities of the Universe. [...]
Without integration the aspirant can in no manner realize the Great Work
of the Sages. Thus, in the Neophyte Ceremony of the Thelemic Order of
the Golden Dawn, it is proclaimed in the Lecture of Balance, <span
class="quote">'Equilibrium is the basis of the Great
Work.'</span>"</span> However in one of her articles about St. Germain,
Iona Miller also wrote that the Great Work involved finding an
equilibrium between the two opposing forces: <span
class="quote">"Alchemy is a mystical method of self-perfection, by the
symbolical exteriorization of the spiritual processes, by projecting
spiritual interior elements on an exterior plane, the metals. In this
way, the Great Work is ambivalent: a holding of the tension of the
opposites, interior and exterior, unifying the Microcosm and the
Macrocosm and thus annihilating <span class="quote">'Creation'</span>
(the dualistic, split world), reiterating the primordial Unity."</span>

<p>When a user on Reddit asked what the meaning of the number 3301 was,
another user posted a cryptic answer which said that <span
class="quote">"3301 is an inspired number forming the division bell
matrix, forming one as path"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/cicada/comments/abz0hu/why_3301_is_there_something_special_about_this/>https://<wbr>www.<wbr>reddit.<wbr>com/<wbr>r/<wbr>cicada/<wbr>comments/<wbr>abz0hu/<wbr>why_<wbr>3301_<wbr>is_<wbr>there_<wbr>something_<wbr>special_<wbr>about_<wbr>this/<wbr></a>]
So the other user said that the number 3301 is related to a path, like
how in Thelema the number 463 signifies a path on the Tree of Life.
Division Bell was an album by Pink Floyd released in 1994, which
contained a hidden puzzle according to a Usenet post by someone with the
name Publius, and during one Pink Floyd concert, there were lights in
front of the stage which spelled out the text <span
class="quote">"Enigma Publius"</span>, which served as evidence that the
Usenet post was genuine.
[<a href=https://counter-currents.com/2021/02/the-dark-side-of-qanon-part-two-the-friends-we-made-along-the-way/>https://<wbr>counter-<wbr>currents.<wbr>com/<wbr>2021/<wbr>02/<wbr>the-<wbr>dark-<wbr>side-<wbr>of-<wbr>qanon-<wbr>part-<wbr>two-<wbr>the-<wbr>friends-<wbr>we-<wbr>made-<wbr>along-<wbr>the-<wbr>way/<wbr></a>]
I thought that the phrase <span class="quote">"division bell
matrix"</span> might refer to the kabbalistic Tree of Life figure, which
somewhat looks like a bell divided in two vertically, or which looks
like a matrix in the mathematical sense of a matrix with multiple
columns and multiple rows, even though I didn't find any source which
would've referred to the Tree of Life figure as a <span
class="quote">"division bell"</span>.</p>
<p>But anyway, if in fact the number 3301 refers to a middle path, it
seems like an appropriate element to be featured in the name of a
cult-like organization like Cicada 3301, because several religious
movements and cults have a name which means something like <span
class="quote">"the path"</span>, including Taoism and the Essenes. And
as a bonus point, the Thelemic middle path also refers to a penis, which
is a common element in symbols employed by cults.</p>
