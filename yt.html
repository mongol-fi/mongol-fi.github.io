<a href=#Text_messages_from_a_CDC_whistleblower id=Text_messages_from_a_CDC_whistleblower>Text
messages from a CDC whistleblower</a>
</h3>
<p>In February 2020 Paul Cottrell became known as <span
class="quote">"the American whistleblower"</span> in China after one of
his YouTube videos went viral in China.
[<a href=https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2>https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%22paul+cottrell%22&amp;gpc=stf%3D1580508000%2C1583013600%7Cstftype%3D2</a>,
<a href=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/>https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91204053/</a>]
In the video, Cottrell said that a follower of his YouTube channel
contacted him on Facebook and sent him screenshots of a text message
conversation. Cottrell said that his follower received the text messages
from someone who worked at the CDC who said that the CDC was covering up
the number of COVID cases in the U.S., and that there were already over
a thousand COVID cases. However the same fake screenshots of text
messages had been published a few days before Cottrell by Hal Turner,
who said that the text messages were not leaked by the person who
received the text messages but by his 18-year-old son who took the
screenshots on his father's phone.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20220124205108/https://rootvoid.com/2020/02/15/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed/>http://web.archive.org/web/20220124205108/https://rootvoid.com/2020/02/15/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed/</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2wemh/comment/fhqrge1/>https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2wemh/comment/fhqrge1/</a>,
<a href=https://x.com/ryanfiredragon/status/1228414604998475777>https://x.com/ryanfiredragon/status/1228414604998475777</a>]
And even earlier the same screenshots had been posted on TikTok on
January 27th 2020 UTC.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200226155731/https://www.tiktok.com/&#x40;user58406547>http://web.archive.org/web/20200226155731/https://www.tiktok.com/@user58406547</a>]
The screenshots were probably fake because they showed the name of the
sender as <span class="quote">"Nancy Messonnier (CDC)"</span> even
though the Messages application on iOS only displays the first name of
the sender.
[<a href=https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/>https://x.com/benplowman/status/1231447635338264576/</a>]
So I don't know if Cottrell was being fed disinformation which he
promoted unwittingly or if he was a willing accomplice in promoting
disinformation.</p>

</h3>
<p>Paul Cottrell's video where he read out the text messages was posted
on February 17th in an unknown timezone.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200313152829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dw_68tV6c0>http://web.archive.org/web/20200313152829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dw_68tV6c0</a>]
But Hal Turner's blog post was dated February 14th.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed>http://web.archive.org/web/20200217063226/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/alleged-c-d-c-text-messages-say-over-1-000-infected-with-coronavirus-in-u-s-a-being-deliberately-concealed</a>]
Hal Turner said that the text messages were leaked by the 18-year-old
son of the person who received the text messages, who took screenshots
of his dad's phone. But Cottrell said that the messages were given to
him by one of his followers on Facebook, who received the text messages
themselves.</p>
<p>When someone on a Chinese website asked if Paul Cottrell's video was
legit, another user linked to Hal Turner's blog post and indicated that
it supported Cottrell's story:
[<a href=https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679>https://www.zhihu.com/question/373999679</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/earlynews-cdc-china.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>An article from 2005 said that Hal Turner was an FBI informant:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS>http://web.archive.org/web/20080118203302/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/NEWS/801170326/-1/NEWS</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal Turner stalked in front of Kingston High School with his neo-Nazi
supporters in 2005, tossing white-power taunts at
counter-demonstrators.</p>
<p>That was just part of his legacy. He railed against President Bush
and Jews, too. He handed out the private addresses of New Jersey Supreme
Court justices.</p>
<p>But some government agencies are OK if you work for them - and Turner
apparently did.</p>
<p>He was an FBI informant, according to the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a group that monitors hate groups and extremists.</p>
<p>According to the center, hackers confronted Turner on his Web site
Jan. 1 and told him they had broken into Turner's computer server.</p>
<p>What they found were e-mails between Turner and an FBI agent who was
apparently Turner's handler. The unidentified hackers posted a July 7
e-mail to the agent. In it, Turner gave the agent a message from someone
threatening to kill Sen. Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, the
center said in a story on its Web site, www.splcenter.org.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Once again,"</span> Turner wrote to the agent,
<span class="quote">"my fierce rhetoric has served to flush out a
possible crazy."</span></p>
<p>When the e-mails hit a neo-Nazi Web site, Turner shut down his own
Web site. <span class="quote">"I hereby separate from the <span
class="quote">'pro-White'</span> movement. I will no longer involve
myself in any aspect of it,"</span> Turner said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Turner said the only thing he can say about the FBI
allegation is <span class="quote">"no comment."</span> The FBI hasn't
commented, either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hal Turner even ran a Nazi rally for the FBI in New York.
[<a href=https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181>https://x.com/HeadlineUSA/status/1807032673942020181</a>]</p>
<p>A New York Times article from 2010 said:
[<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04hal.html</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Turner described his repulsion to racist views even
as he became one of the country's most prominent proponents of them. He
said he never wanted anyone to get hurt.</p>
<p>Mr. Turner painted a contrarian picture of himself as a patriot who
answered the call of the federal government to infiltrate the white
supremacist movement. He said he received more than $100,000 in payments
for his assistance and helped avert <span class="quote">"more than 10
acts of domestic terrorism,"</span> but his outspokenness so concerned
the F.B.I. that the agency eventually stopped using him, and he was
later arrested.</p>
<p>He said he never believed the message he promulgated, citing a letter
he wrote to one F.B.I. agent that said, <span class="quote">"Just be
confident that the person you hear [or hear about] on radio is not real
life."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2008 Hal Turner was plotting a feigned sequel to the Oklahoma City
bombing:
[<a href=https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/>https://headlineusa.com/fed-files-iii-fbi-informants-phony-obama-truck-bomb-tip-spurred-federal-probe/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a plot similar to the Oklahoma City bombing: neo-Nazi Bill
White was said to have had plans in October 2008 to attack a Roanoke,
Virginia federal building with a truck bomb in retaliation for legal
proceedings taking place against him there.</p>
<p>Except this time, the <span class="quote">"plot"</span> was
non-existent, coming from a dubious source in former FBI informant and
convicted felon Hal Turner.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><span class="quote">"[The FBI informant Hal] Turner went to these two
guys and told them to set me up so he could get his informant contract
back ... they concocted a story that I [planned to] blow up Barack Obama
with a truck bomb,"</span> White told Dr. Ostrov in 2016, according to
the doctor's report.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But then, in 2010, FBI informant Turner admitted in court that he
told the feds about the phony federal building bomb plot. Turner had
been arrested for inciting violence against three federal judges, and he
was testifying in court that he was an important asset to the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020 Qtards were saying that Chinese troops tried to invade USA
through the Quebec-Maine border, but they got bombed to death. Someone
tracked the origin of the story to Hal Turner's blog:
[<a href=https://x.com/aobrien2010/status/1338675691655663616>https://x.com/aobrien2010/status/1338675691655663616</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/earlynews-cdc-canada-tanks.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>In the blog post Hal Turner cited unnamed <span
class="quote">"intelligence sources"</span> as his source in his blog
post.
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20201025014401/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/u-s-moving-self-propelled-artillery-to-border-with-quebec-reports-of-uniformed-chinese-troops-in-canada>http://web.archive.org/web/20201025014401/https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/u-s-moving-self-propelled-artillery-to-border-with-quebec-reports-of-uniformed-chinese-troops-in-canada</a>]</p>
<h3>
<a href=#Connection_to_Cicada_3301 id=Connection_to_Cicada_3301>Connection
to Cicada 3301</a>
</h3>
<p>In the description of one of Cottrell's old YouTube videos, there was
a link to a video from 2015 on a channel called Abraham Lincoln, where
the thumbnail of the video consisted of the logo of Cicada 3301:
[<a href=https://altcensored.com/watch?v=SWg1-3n4tM8>https://altcensored.com/watch?v=SWg1-3n4tM8</a>,
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCmKGFTEO2g</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cicada.png width=500>
</div>
<p>Cottrell said that the Abraham Lincoln channel was his backup
channel, and he said that his followers should solve the puzzle on the
channel, because it would teach them skills they might need to
communicate with each other in the future if communications between
people were restricted.</p>
<p>The spectrogram of the video featured the Cicada 3301 logo and an
image of Abraham Lincoln along with the pieces of text <span
class="quote">"1984 is here"</span>, <span class="quote">"America wake
up"</span>, <span class="quote">"All your doors are unlocked"</span>,
and <span class="quote">"Big Brother I am watching you. 3301"</span>:
<code>yt-dlp bCmKGFTEO2g;ffmpeg -i *bCmKGFTEO2g* -vn a.wav;sox a.wav -n spectrogram;qlmanage -p spectrogram.png</code>.
The puzzle probably continues after that but I didn't figure out how to
proceed in solving the puzzle.</p>
<p>The Abraham Lincoln video has about 600 comments which were almost
all posted in 2020 when Cottrell mentioned the video, and the comments
seem to be from Cottrell's followers. However there is only one comment
posted before 2020 which says: <span class="quote">"For future
reference, if anyone is watching this the fourth bowel strikes seven as
Pluto enters the spectrogram."</span> So it might be a hint on how to
continue the puzzle after getting the spectrogram image:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-hint.png width=600>
</div>
<p>The user who posted the hint has 4 YouTube videos, but they're all
some songs that were slowed down with added reverb. And they were posted
in 2019 or 2020 so they probably don't have anything to do with the
Cicada puzzle.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnuqErgpI4d5nW-qe6iwVQ>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnuqErgpI4d5nW-qe6iwVQ</a>]</p>
<p>Later in October 2020, Cottrell posted a video on his main channel
where he took a screencapture of the Abraham Lincoln video. In the
comments someone asked <span class="quote">"What is this?"</span>, but
Cottrell replied <span class="quote">"forward operations"</span>, and
when someone else said it was a puzzle, Cottrell replied <span
class="quote">"much more than a puzzle my friend"</span>:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRNXFCOV8s</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-cottrell-cicada-3301.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>When I googled for the term <span class="quote">"forward
operations"</span> in double quotes, most results were about something
called <span class="quote">"defend forward operations"</span> or <span
class="quote">"hunt forward operations"</span>, which appear to be terms
that are used in the context of cyber warfare and which refer to
defensive cyber operations. For example an article by U.S. Cyber Command
said: <span class="quote">"Hunt Forward Operations (HFOs) are strictly
defensive cyber operations conducted by U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)
at the request of partner nations."</span>
[<a href=https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/3218642/cyber-101-hunt-forward-operations/>https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/3218642/cyber-101-hunt-forward-operations/</a>]
And a book titled <span class="quote">"The United States' Defend Forward
Cyber Strategy"</span> said that <span class="quote">"Defend Forward
operations are non-use of force actions designed to counter ongoing
hostile cyber operations taking place during day-to-day strategic
competition."</span>
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHhXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA20>https://books.google.com/books?id=nHhXEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20</a>]</p>
<p>In addition to the Cicada 3301 video, Cottrell also posted this
second cryptic video in October 2020 that only consists of text that
says <span class="quote">"STONEHENGE 4-10-4"</span> and no audio.
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oEBLAuVRj0</a>]
The video included this comment by a user called laurabradshaw2264:
<span class="quote">"Hello. Just to say coincidentally there is a
skeleton at Stonehenge that was tagged as no. 4-10-4. He was decapitated
and it was rumoured that it may have been king Arthur."</span> It sounds
like something from a Cicada puzzle, because they involve historical
artifacts or themes like the Grail legend:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-arthur.png width=500>
</div>
<p>In March 2020 Paul Cottrell appeared as a guest on Michael Decon's
radio show together with Thomas Schoenberger. It was the first time
Schoenberger appeared on the radio show, but Cottrell had appeared on
the show a few times earlier, so Schoenberger may have appeared on
Decon's show if he wanted to do a show with Cottrell. At time 36:10,
Schoenberger said he had followed Cottrell's channel since around
mid-January: <span class="quote">"Dr. Cottrell, you're making a huge
impact, huge, number one. I have a friend named Ryan, he's an
endocrinologist, he's in New York. When I first heard your show - this
is, uh, mid-January - he said, oh he's a catastrophic thinker. He now is
addicted to you and he thinks you're right on the money. You're making a

<p>Douglas Gabriel from American Intelligence Media is also linked to
Cicada 3301, and he and John Barnwell from AIM have done several
interviews with Cottrell's buddy Leo Zagami, who claims that he is a
33rd degree Freemason and who also had a radio show on Global
Enlightenment Network like Cottrell. Douglas Gabriel is one of the
leading anthroposophists in the United States, and he has said that he
worked as a cryptologist for the NSA, that he was a Jesuit and a
freemason, and that he was tasked by the Society of Jesus to infiltrate
anthroposophy.

However he might be lying about some aspects of his resume, because he
has also said that he is a clairvoyant, and exorcist, and a ghostbuster.
Douglas Gabriel also wrote: <span class="quote">"In 2017, a Cicada 3301

contains a total of three people, who are Bruce Cooper Clarke Jr. who
was the director of the Office of Strategic Research at the CIA, Iona

who created Debian Linux.

featured as a guest of the Leak Project and Oppenheimer Ranch Project
channels on YouTube, which were the first two channels I found where
Paul Cottrell appeared as a guest, and in fact Cottrell and Richard Alan

<p>On February 4th 2020, Paul Cottrell did a short video where he showed
the tweet below by Voice of Guo Media, and he claimed it contained a
hidden message which showed that the coronavirus pandemic was part of a
secret CIA operation to take down the CCP. He said: <span

You take 2020, which is two plus zero plus two plus zero is four. Divide
it by two, it's two. When you take those answers from those ratios, it
adds to three, it makes three, two, two. That is the sign. That's the
code that the CIA operation is happening. There is a takedown of the CCP

<p>A video titled <span class="quote">"Zionist George Webb - Mossad's

the following:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBC3gChmKQ</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(0:09) All my French Mossad homies want me to do a shout out to
Francis Cabrel. [...] It's just the spycraft and the beauty of how Mossad
does shit. You know, I just - especially the French Mossad is just
really fantastic spycraft. And really the antecedents of that go all the
way back to World War 2. This is when they were working with OSS - and
I've said this before - they would have these radio shows at night where
they would do different songs, play different songs, and the songs were
encoded. Certain songs would mean blow up the local railroad. Thanks
Mossad homies and [something Français?] because you've helped me out so
much in this. [...]</p>
<p>(1:00) One of the things that's been so hard for me in this series is
playing the Mossad thing. Because so many people have come out against
Mossad and how evil Mossad is and so forth. [...]</p>
<p>(1:14) So that's - I'm always rooting for Mossad secretly kind of.
And this is what that is. [...]</p>
<p>(1:35) My sources, and I'm - you saw French Mossad today, you know,
give me some stuff. [...]</p>
<p>(2:54) And then there's the great Mossad, which was fundamental to
the survival of Israel. I know people are going to say we did a lot of
stuff. And you know with the Lebanese babies and the Yemeni babies and
Palestine and - I'm not getting into that, I don't want to get into
that. Organ harvesting and all this, we can do business the old way. We
still make a lot of money, make everybody happy, make movies, whatever
we do. [...]</p>
<p>(4:37) I do have some ties with Israel. [...] And I'm with the old
guard. You know, the Negev Brigade, and Ben-Gurion, and Avi
Braverman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a video from where Addy Adds interviewed George Webb, Addy asked:
<span class="quote">"What would you say to someone who thinks you guys
are Mossad?"</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyYua5NptU&t=1h2m25s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyYua5NptU&amp;t=1h2m25s</a>,
now deleted] Then George Webb laughed and said: <span
class="quote">"Sending email to people who have intelligence backgrounds
in Europe does not make you an operative. I've never accepted any money
from Israel. And I wanted my kids to go serve in the IDF, which they
both disappointed me greatly by saying no. Basically because I thought
Israel needed military help a lot more than the US. No-one in their
right mind would attack the US, but we have 7 countries surrounding
Israel."</span> About five minutes later George Webb said <span
class="quote">"I just want to say that my 100% loyalty is to the United
States."</span> But if he wanted his kids to serve in the military of a
foreign country, then is not at least 1% of his loyalty to the foreign
country/</p>
<p>In an interview with Doug Haggmann in 2017, George Webb said: <span
class="quote">"What I disclosed to Dr. Corsi tonight was that I was a
member of the - what informally was known as the WikiLeaks network -
which is an up-down network - and you don't know - in a blind network,
you don't know when you're passing down drives. You don't know anything
more than your downstream and your upstream. You don't know anything
more than where you're getting the thumb drive from, and where you're
getting it to, and you don't know what's on the thumb drive."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDAZ3pF9jIw>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDAZ3pF9jIw</a>]
Then Hagmann asked Webb: <span class="quote">"You were part of the
WikiLeaks transfer of information personally?"</span> And Webb answered:
<span class="quote">"Yeah, so yes, it was. So, before WikiLeaks was even
formed, there was an RT network, before the RT was even formed, there
was a network of getting information between New York and London. And
what you would do is basically thumb drives in Central Park is what I
would call it. But there were people that were not getting published in
Europe that needed to be published in the United States. So it was thumb
drives would come this way from people, writing - basically authors or
dissidents - coming to New York. And then there was a branch going the
other way first, mainly South American journalists that
[unintelligible], this was mainly through the Czech embassy in New York,
that's my experience, so I don't have any more experience than that. But
this isn't new, this isn't new, and WikiLeaks was formed after that. And
some thumb drive drops in Central Park are not new. And that's how it
works. And you know, I new, I mean, I actually met Julian Assange in
Australia in 1984 when he was a kid. And he is a piece of the puzzle,
but he's not the whole puzzle. It's bigger than Julian Assange, and I'll
just leave it at that."</span></p>
<p>Patricia Negron (Trish the Dish) used to be featured in live streams
on George Webb's YouTube channel. In an interview with Albert Bishai in
2020, she said: <span class="quote">"Someone asked if George Webb is an
operative. And he definitely is some kind of an operative. Because one
of the things I learned during this lawsuit was George kept trying to
file to intervene, which drives up the costs for anyone who's involved.
And so, he's filing all this shit again and again and again. And one of
the things that he filed was a certification for the Department of
Homeland Security, level 3, that he apparently got - I looked at the
dates - during the time that I was doing live streams with him and
Jason. And he never mentioned any of this. He would always say, he's
going over to his son's house, or somewhere to meet with someone or
something. He was doing this training program with Department of
Homeland Security."</span>

<p>From Steve Outrim's posts on George Webb:
[<a href=https://burners.me/tag/george-webb/>https://burners.me/tag/george-webb/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Butowsky and George Webb are both connected to respected journalist
Seymour Hersh, who claimed to have inside FBI sources about the <span
class="quote">"Seth Rich files"</span> that may well have actually been
George Webb &amp; co (although according to Ed Butowsky Hersh claimed
his FBI source was George's nemesis, disgraced FBI Deputy Director
Andrew McCabe - which makes the relationship between Webb and Hersh
highly suspicious).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb claims to have known Julian Assange since he was a
teenager, and to have been a participant in delivering information to
WikiLeaks by giving thumb drives to Michael Ratner, Ellen's late
brother. He did this from the Harvard Club at dinner with Jerome Corsi
and Jason Goodman, calling into the Hagmann Report. Sadly Doug Hagmann's
son and #PizzaGate reporter Joe died suddenly just after Isaac Kappy and
just before Tracy Twyman.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb attended some of Epstein's parties in New York. His
former room-mate was a US Secret Service agent who secretly videotaped
some of these events.</p>
<p>Michael Flynn wrote glowing letters of recommendation for Robyn
Gritz, and vice versa. Robyn Laird Gritz, mentioned in the Stratfor
Wikileaks, has been a frequent guest on George Webb and Jason Goodman's
YouTube channels and is someone who claimed to be a friend of Jenny
Moore but didn't know her real name or have her phone number."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb claims to be a proud Zionist and ally of Mossad - but
<span class="quote">"old"</span> Mossad, French Mossad. He is seeking
<span class="quote">"a little of bit of compromise, a little bit of drug
trafficking, a little bit of organ harvesting"</span>.</p>
<p>George Webb claims to have many connections in and much knowledge of
the intelligence community. I have been in touch with one of his closest
sources over the past couple of years, who is indeed part of the
intelligence community, inter-generationally. George also claims to be
friends with James Alefantis and to have been involved with human
trafficking in the Balkans in the 90's, and that he was personally
targeted by FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe after being compromised in
BDSM sessions with porn star Janine Lindemulder.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>George Webb and Jason Goodman both appear to speak fluent Russian.
Jason Goodman was married to a Ukrainian and was CEO of a drone company
Aerocine, famous for flying high-definition camera drones over
Chernobyl, Ukraine around the time of the Maidan Revolution. Jason
Goodman's former social media director is now running a drone company
with a board almost entirely made up of IDF leaders. One of the worst
cyber virus attacks in modern history originated out of Ukraine in 2017,
targeted at the Maersk Shipping Line the same month they became victims
of CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER - a different kind of cyber-attack launched
in America featuring George, Jason, Trish and Dr Corsi. Jason Goodman is
Defendant in multiple lawsuits relating to CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an interview with Kerry Cassidy in 2017, George Webb said that he
had knowledge of two instances where Trump was compromized by Epstein.
Webb also said that he <span class="quote">"roomed with a gal who worked
the Trump parties - the Epstein-Trump parties"</span>. But it's not
clear if Webb himself went to the parties, or if his story was that he
heard about them from the girl or from some other source:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxnxWCBu6I</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(00:00) I think Trump is just really - so I've known him a long time.
I was involved in - like you mentioned - the Franklin case,
tangentially. The Paul Rodriguez who broke the Franklin story in 89
worked for The Washington Times. And I tried to get a story to him in
2002. I passed him some information in 2003, but he never wrote the
story. And then he died of cancer at a young age. I think he was a great
journalist. And sometimes, you know, there's a lot of bloody footprints
in this business.</p>
<p>But Trump was one of the Epstein Brownstone operations in 1993. It
was two incidents. One was kind of a lead-up incident, and then the
other one was - but it was - he didn't know how old - I mean, I'm just
gonna say this. This is history. He didn't know how old the girls were.
The girl - he didn't know how old the girl was at the time. So this is
the kind of dirt they had on Trump, and that Epstein had on Trump.</p>
<p>And I think Trump is best off saying, look, you know, it was 1983
that that happened, and I didn't know. And Jeff, you were the one who
had a CIA operation, or you had a DynCorp operation with 12 cameras.
You're the one who put that girl in the room, and brought her in from
Kosovo or Bosnia, or wherever you bought her in from. I think there's
more than enough blame to go around here. And I'm not gonna have my
presidency compromised by that - by those two incidents.</p>
<p>So I roomed with - I was in New York in 2002 and 2003. I roomed with
a gal who worked the Trump parties - the Epstein-Trump parties. She was
a caterer. She was a model and everyting at other times, but she did
that. They did Long Island parties, and they did these parties on the
Upper West Side, where Jeff Epstein's stone fortress is up there.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a good - the parties had a beginning, and a
middle, and an end. The partiers would come in, and there was - it was
kind of handshakes, and Bloomberg, and Trump and everybody. In the
middle, it's kind of a lull, where all the waitresses disappeared, and
the waiters disappeared, and then they'd come out in their new costumes,
and then everyone would go, <span class="quote">"oops, this is getting
crazy, I'm leaving."</span> And then there would be the kind of like
entendres that would occur after that, where there was these rooms that
were set up and they were being filmed.</p>
<p>What Trump always came in for like five minutes. Some model, had his
picture taken, took a couple - shook a couple hands, and he would leave.
He didn't - he wasn't the, oh my god, I have to stay here and, lurk, and
you know, troll, for some kind of -. He was always with some beautiful
model. And he probably went to - I'm gonna guess - thirty Jeff Epstein
parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a Periscope livestream in 2017, George Webb said the following:

<blockquote>
<p>(10:45) So, let me - I was talking about Mossad earlier. So, so, I
didn't know that these people that were presenting themselves - little
bit at a time - <span class="quote">"Oh, I'm just a diplomat. Oh, I'm
just actually, uh, well, actually I had some intelligence background way
back when. Oh, actually, um, I did a few operations. Oh, well, I might
still do occasional stuff for blah blah blah. Oh, yeah, actually I am
French intel."</span> That kinda procedure. And this happened to me with
the Dutch. And now I'm just - I'm gonna let everybody know right now, I
used to work with the Dutch in New York. So it wasn't Russia. And I did
drops. [...] (11:44) But, then, I had one from Germany. And they're always
- I don't know why they always use women, but they're always these
brilliant women. [...] They always go with the kind of Madam Curie types
that end up approaching me. [...] They're all like, <span
class="quote">"Oh, by the way, you know, the Maltese Falcon was assigned
to pay Soros 3,000 dollars, you know, to get out the, you know, to get
to the Casa Blanca."</span> [...] It used to be that you had the Maltese
Falcon at the window at the Jewish haberdashers. That meant that you
could give them 3,000 bucks to - or I can't remember how many marks, or
whatever it was - but anyway, you could get letters of transit to get to
Casa Blanca. [...] (13:00) There was a time at the Plaza Hotel with the
German, back in 2001-2002. That's how I knew the caterer who went over
there to CFR. That's how I had the CFR info, ok. [...] The LISK, I wasn't
a genius on the LISK. [...] I wasn't a genius on the Long Island Serial
Killer. That came from the Epstein stuff that I did, from my
roommate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next at time 18:44 when Jason Goodman asked how Israel is so in
control even though it's such a tiny country, Webb used the pronoun
<span class="quote">"we"</span> to refer to Israel: <span
class="quote">"Because they know how to - I mean we know how to
co-operate [?] sources. I mean, that's the key. And, and, in defense of
Israel - and, you know, I almost went into the - uh, I have regrets in
my life, in that last phone call, when I thought the cleanup guys who
were going to take care of it, I was also - I was gonna go into the,
<span class="quote">'Oh, my son didn't go into the IDF'</span> - I know
I've told you that before - <span class="quote">'my daughter wouldn't go
to the IDF. I know he's a doctor, but I'm really ashamed that he didn't
go into the IDF.'</span>"</span> Then Jason Goodman asked Webb: <span
class="quote">"Did you live in Israel?"</span> Then Webb answered: <span
class="quote">"No, no, no, I never went into Israel. Uh, but anyway, a
lot of people I worked with in New York way back when were from that
network, so you're gonna find that. I'm just trying to prove out the
intelligence links without giving anything up."</span></p>
<p>In the same Periscope stream I linked above, George Webb first listed
several of his intelligence contacts, and then he said <span
class="quote">"when you start way smarter than your IQ, there's a good
chance there's an intelligence person behind you making you
smarter"</span>. He said: <span class="quote">"So anyway, the
intelligence links. So that was the French link. There's a British gal.
Guess who? I'm not gonna say. And anyway, there's a Serbian gal, here's
a gal from Kosovo, they're all women. [...] There's one other one that I,
well, I'm not gonna say that one. So, but anyway, when you start way

<p>In a video clip that was posted by Defango on Steemit, Webb said:

- but anyway - and Jewish, so that's - I'm always rooting for Mossad,

But I don't know if he was joking or serious when he said he is always
secretly rooting for Mossad.</p>
<p>In June 2023 George Webb tweeted: <span class="quote">"@Hageulah

Next he replied: <span class="quote">"@MHageulah Should have been tips.

<p>During the Steele v. Goodman case in 2019, Steve Outtrim presented
the following testimony:

<blockquote>
<p>In December 2018, I interviewed a former collaborator of Jason
Goodman on my podcast (Exhibit H - Queen Tut Spills the Beans). Susan
Lutzke aka Queen Tut has been named as a codefendant in this lawsuit and
has also been named as a co-conspirator by Defendant Goodman (doc. no.
78). She appeared on dozens of shows on Jason Goodman's channel and
contributed research to him. During this interview (Exhibit H), she
disclosed that Jason Goodman's source <span class="quote">"Deep
Uranium"</span> aka Rock Hudson" aka <span class="quote">"Mr
Hudson"</span> was actually an FBI informant/provocateur named Okey
Marshall Richards, Jr. He was working in close collaboration with Jason
Goodman and his accomplice George Webb Sweigert in their <span
class="quote">"Clear and Present Danger"</span> disinformation operation
to shut down the Port of Charleston.</p>
<p>Queen Tut further revealed connections between Mr. Goodman and
Aerocine, a corporation that listed Mr. Goodman as the CEO. Aerocine
flew advanced imagery drones over the Chernobyl nuclear site near Kiev,
Ukraine, a couple of weeks before the Maidan Revolution broke out there.
See Exhibit I (Goodman CEO of Aerocine), Exhibit J (Goodman presentation
on Ukraine drone flight as CEO of Aerocine, two (2) weeks after Maidan
Revolution). Mr. Goodman was married to a Ukrainian and appears to speak
fluent Russian (Exhibit K).</p>
<p>The involvement of Russians and Ukrainians on social media channels
in <span class="quote">"active measures"</span> disinformation
operations, smear campaigns, gang-stalking, and cyber-attacks is of
great concern to me. The large number of former CIA, FBI, and military
intelligence guests on Mr. Goodman's channel all tell similar stories
that are highly critical of the United States government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a book about 9/11 called <span class="quote">"Towers of
Deception"</span> published in 2006 that may have served as an
inspiration for Webb and Goodman's Charleston dirty bomb hoax, beacuse
the first chapter of the book starts out with a fictional scenario where
an Iranian suitcase nuke blows up in the port of Charleston: <span
class="quote">"It's an out-of-the-blue, in-your-face, screaming-horror
surprise. A nuclear weapon blows up in the harbor at Charleston, South
Carolina. It's another 9/11. It's Nuclear Jihad. A repulsed and confused
world shudders at the burning devastation. A radioactive cloud drifts
off over the Atlantic. The death toll is unknown. Hundreds of thousands
of survivors evacuate. This time the White House is in charge. No more
Katrinas. The military is your friend. The president addresses the
nation and the world: a <span class="quote">'suitcase nuke'</span> from
the old Soviet arsenal has been obtained by Islamic terrorists, almost
certainly Iranian, he intones."</span>

George Webb to Dr Jerome Corsi. Corsi
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSO6EEzQby4>fed George with

<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDAZ3pF9jIw>part of the
WikiLeaks network</a>, that he used to participate in thumb-drive drops
in parks where he gave information to Mike Ratner (died 5/11/16) who
passed it on to John Jones (died 8/16/16). Dead men can verify no tales.
George also said that he met

<blockquote>
<p>I applaud your subpoena of Jerome Corsi. I first encountered Corsi in
1995 when he orchestrated a fraud for which Minneapolis FBI agents
sought to frame me - after I returned from Baghdad in February 1997
with:</p>
<p>(1) evidence of no WMD, (2) an offer from the senior-most sheikhs to
remove Saddam Hussein without a war (to which Saddam reportedly agreed),
and (3) an offer to provide U.S. firms with the bulk of the contracts
for reconstruction and oil. Rather than engage me in good faith (federal
law then prohibited my travel to Iraq), colleague Munther Ghazal and I
were stalked by agents within both the FBI and the DIA, including Mossad
operatives posing as FBI agents, as chronicled in the accompanying
exhibits.</p>
<p>Jerome Corsi is the first person from whom I heard the phrase <span
class="quote">"preparing the mind"</span> when he oversaw a fraud
designed to discredit me in Poland at a time when the Knesset was
predominantly Polish. That fraud was financed by Carl Lindner whose
website then boasted that he was the largest non-Jewish contributor to
Jewish causes in the U.S. I urge that you immediately engage the
documentation provided. My life experience proves the common source of
ongoing geopolitical duplicity, including the narrative-advancing role
played by Corsi.</p>
<p>To portray Corsi as a conspiracy theorist misses the point. He is
either an Israeli agent or a wellpaid asset of the Jewish state. Ask him
about me. Better yet, subpoena me, Munther Ghazal, Ron Burd, my attorney
since 1992, and Jeff Gates, a colleague since 2002. Let us provide
questions to ask Corsi. Note how, while I was in London, I outed him as
a Mossad operative, per the blue-tabbed material. He knows what he did -
and for whom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 2020 Jerome Corsi launched a telehealth website called
SpeakWithAnMD.com, where he raked in millions dollars by offering
prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin. A
report on the website said: <span class="quote">"America's Frontline
Doctors (AFLDS) - a leading purveyor of coronavirus misinformation -
refers patients to SpeakWithAnMD.com, stating that SpeakWithAnMD.com
provides phone consultations with <span class="quote">'AFLDS-trained
physicians'</span> willing to prescribe hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,
and other unproven treatments. According to recent reports, AFLDS
referred over 255,000 individuals to SpeakWithAnMD.com between July 16,
2021, and September 12, 2021 - approximately 72,000 of whom paid $90 for
initial phone consultations and many of whom had follow-up consultations
for an additional $60."</span>

So the initial consultation fees add up to about 6.5 million USD, even
though it was over a period of less than 2 months through a single
referrer alone. AFLDS was ran by the Jew Simone Gold, and their news
team was ran out of Israel by the Chabadnik Mordechai Sones who
previously worked on <span class="quote">"research in areas of how to
upgade CIA covert arms pipeline to Afghans"</span>.

<p>The three products that were initially promoted on Corsi's website
were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc, which are the three
components of the protocol developed by the Chabadnik Vladimir Zelenko.
Corsi's website offered prescriptions for HCQ and azithromycin, but they
had a partnership with an online pharmacy called Bonsa Health which
shipped the drugs and which I guess also sold zinc.

a single dose of about 4-5 tablets for a body weight of 150 lbs.

appeared on Michael Decon's radio show together with Schoenberger:

<blockquote>
<p>In a dramatic turn of events, <span class="quote">"Hollywood film
maker"</span> Jason Goodman has in so many words declared a so-called
cyber war on <span class="quote">"Doctor"</span> Paul Cottrell. In sum,
now Goodman is insinuating that Cottrell is a member of a <span
class="quote">"social engineering"</span> team or is a <span
class="quote">"social engineer"</span>.</p>
<p>Cottrell simply states that he believes COVID-19 is a bio-engineered
virus for scientific purposes that can be traced to 2008.</p>
<p>The use of the term <span class="quote">"social engineer"</span> is a
stock term Jason Goodman allegedly applies to members of the <span
class="quote">"decentralized distributed defamation"</span> social media
engineers associated with Thomas Schoenberger (Shadowbox Strategies). A
social media podcast featuring a Thomas Schoenberger interview with
<span class="quote">"Dr."</span> Paul Cottrell has surfaced.</p>
<p>Jason Goodman (alleged friend of Brian Singer) has accused
Schoenberger (in court documents) of operating with a group of joint
tortfeasors (<span class="quote">"gang"</span>) made up of Manuel
Chavez, III, Carson City, Nevada, and George Webb (Sweigert), Cobb
Island, Maryland. Goodman believes that Schoenberger and Webb are
working secretly with Robert David Steele, Oakton, Virginia.</p>
<p>In the video below, Jason Goodman launches into a profane litany of
swear words. In fact, Goodman tells Cottrell that <span
class="quote">"he will never be a medical doctor"</span> and that he is
a <span class="quote">"threat to society"</span>, etc. These seem to be
stock Goodman phrases as they riddle court documents in Virginia and New
York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jason Goodman published a video of his argument with Paul Cottrell
over the phone, but it sounded like both of them were actors playing a
role, and they were both acting in an exaggeratedly aggressive manner.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/8aAnVACgQ8sI/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/8aAnVACgQ8sI/</a>]
Goodman also published a similar confrontational phone call he had with
Cameron Kyle-Sidell, where Goodman kept saying the pandemic was fake and
that Kyle-Sidell was involved in falsely exaggerating the pandemic, but
at the end of the call Kyle-Sidell hung up after Goodman asked him:
<span class="quote">"have you ever been involved in a simulation with
Colleen Smith or not?"</span>

similar to Goodman's phone call with Cottrell:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-sidell-cotrell.jpg width=800>

<p>The same day when Jason Goodman posted the video about his fight with
Cottrell, he also posted one video he did with Jerome Corsi, another
video he did with the so-called former CIA agent Kevin Shipp, and
another video about a phone call with a nurse from the frontlines (which
is reminiscent of all the phone calls that Cottrell is supposed to have
done with people on the frontlines of the COVID response, even though I
don't know if some of them were just actors):</p>

<p>The self-described former CIA agent Kevin Shipp used to be a regular
guest on Goodman's videos. Goodman always accuses his adversaries of
being <span class="quote">"social engineers"</span>, but one time Shipp
said that the way you can defeat the social engineers who were coming
after Goodman was to subscribe to Crowdsource the Truth on Patreon:

<p>Jason Goodman also published a phone call he did with the medical
simulation expert Colleen Smith, who was the star of a video about
Elmhurst Hospital that was published by the New York Times. Cameron
Kyle-Sidell said: <span class="quote">"I actually know Colleen. She was

<p>In May 2020 Goodman also published another phone interview with a
supposed ICU nurse. The description of the video said: <span
class="quote">"A Crowdsource the Truth viewer who works in one of the
nation's top rated intensive care units reached out to me for a phone

<p>Part of the modus operandi of the WWE fighting circuit around George
Webb and Jason Goodman was that they staged an endless series of fights
between different members of the circuit, so then conspiracy researchers
wasted their time following the fights instead of doing something
productive, like how Robert David Steele sued Jason Goodman, George Webb
sued Jason Goodman, George Webb's brother sued Jason Goodman, George
Webb sued Robert Malone, and so on. So it's suspicious that Goodman was
also pulled into their scheme of interlocking fights.</p>
<p>When Robert David Steele filed his 24 million USD defamation lawsuit
against Jason Goodman, he was represented by Steven Biss who also
represented Robert Malone when Malone filed his 25 million USD
defamation lawsuit against the Breggins and Jane Ruby (and perhaps not
coincidentally Biss's wife Tanya Biss was funding Thomas Schoenberger
and Defango).</p>

drone footage in Chernobyl in February 2014 when the Maidan coup took
place. Steve Outtrim wrote that around the same time, <span

<p>It might be a coincidence, but in the comments of Paul Cottrell's
YouTube video for a Cicada 3301 puzzle, someone asked <span
class="quote">"What is this?"</span>, but Cottrell replied <span
class="quote">"forward operations"</span>. I found <span
class="quote">"forward operations"</span> seems to primarily be a term
used in cyber warfare which refers to defensive cyber operations.</p>
<p>It's probably not related, but I found an Instagram account called
<span class="quote">"Forward Operations Group"</span> that posted photos
of <span class="quote">"special mission units"</span>:</p>

<p>I also found a tweet which said that someone called Jack Kelly was an

When I googled for <code>"jack kelly" "forward operations"</code>, I
found an article by Jack Kelly from 2023 titled <span

<p>The LinkedIn profile of a Serbian guy called Ivan Stamatovski says
that he worked for Jason Goodman's company AeroCine from 2004 to 2011.

In 2014 he started a drone company called Easy Aerial, whose clients
have included the United States Air Force and Navy. The advisory board
of Easy Aerial included five people who were senior officials in the
Israeli Air Force:</p>

<p>Jason Goodman may have been the first person who started filming
empty hospitals in order to show that the pandemic was fake. Jason
Goodman had a playlist on his YouTube channel for videos he shot from
different hospitals, and he also tweeted that <span class="quote">"I
think I may have visited more hospitals than anyone else, at least that

<p>His first video from empty hospitals may have been a video from March
17th UTC titled <span class="quote">"NYC Ghost Town - Hunting Covid-19

<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/vml8MdukptU>https://www.bitchute.com/video/vml8MdukptU</a>]
In the video he talked about an article by Jon Rappoport which claimed
that PCR tests were inaccurate, he said the virus was the cronyvirus,
and he interviewed people outside a hospital who said they were not yet
seeing many COVID patients. The next day on March 18th 2020 he posted
another video titled <span class="quote">"NYC Ghost Town - Where's Viro?
Day 2 Hunting Covid-19 at New York Hospitals During Pseudo
Pandemic"</span>, which he described the video like this: <span
class="quote">"While we can still exercise our right to move freely I

<p>When I tried searching Twitter for early videos which said that
hospitals were empty, I didn't find any videos earlier than Goodman's
video from March 17th UTC. One of the earliest videos I found was posted
by someone from Ireland on March 27th UTC, but someone who replied to
the tweet pointed out that hospitals were also empty in NYC and linked
to a video by Jason Goodman.

<p>In a video published on March 27th 2020 UTC, Robert David Steele
said: <span class="quote">"There's also a lot of fakery then. For
example in New York City they're talking about morgues and emergencies

zero. Zero."</span>
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/CRffTaPc3Cs/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/CRffTaPc3Cs/</a>,
time 2:12] By citizen journalists he may have meant Jason Goodman, who
was doing the same schtick as George Webb where he called himself a
citizen journalist and he traveled to different locations shooting
Periscope videos about stories he covered.</p>
<p>The oldest tweet with the hashtag #filmyourhospital I found was
posted on March 29th UTC by DeAnna Lorraine, who now has a show on the
Stew Peters Network.

<p>In early 2020 Jason Goodman did many videos with Ole Dammegård,
including a video on February 24th UTC about how COVID was caused by 5G.

website lightonconspiracies.com.
[<a href=http://mileswmathis.com/interview.pdf>http://mileswmathis.com/interview.pdf</a>]
On April 1st UTC, Dammegård published a blog post about a video by
Aajonus Vonderplanitz who said that viruses are soap which is produced
by the human body to clean debris, but the same video had been mirrored
to BitChute a week earlier by David Weiss.

In July 2020 Ole Dammegård and David Weiss appeared together as guests
on Jason Goodman's YouTube channel.

<p>Andrew Kaufman's first viral video was a clip of his presentation
that was livestreamed by the flat earther James True on March 31st UTC,
but the original livestream didn't get as many views as a clip of the
video which was published a few days later. However Ole Dammegård's blog
had a post dated March 31st about the original livestream, even though
up to that point I believe all of Kaufman's appearances in alt media had
been on flat earth channels, and there's only a handful of references to
him on Twitter before April 2020.
[<a href=https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-anatomy-of-the-covid-virus/>https://lightonconspiracies.com/the-anatomy-of-the-covid-virus/</a>]</p>
<p>On May 11th 2020 UTC, Ole Dammegård and Jason Goodman also did a
livestream with Andrew Kaufman.

Jason Goodman tweeted that the interview was <span class="quote">"one of

<p>In March 2020, Jason Goodman tweeted a link to his interview with
John Mark Dougan with this text: <span class="quote">"Former Palm Beach

Dougan claimed that he had tested positive for COVID a week ago, even
though at that point Russia had only had a total of about 30 COVID
cases.
[<a href=https://www.bitchute.com/video/6qfuOcebagU/>https://www.bitchute.com/video/6qfuOcebagU/</a>,
time 11:10] He also showed a photo of people in hazmat suits who are
supposed to have come in to test him to his apartment:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-douganearly.jpg width=500>

<p>In September 2022 John Mark Dougan published a fake RAND Corporation
memo which he claimed was leaked to him by someone from Germany. The
memo said that America designed the war in Ukraine for the purpose of
weakening Germany.
[<a href=https://redpill78.substack.com/p/newly-leaked-report-from-rand-corporation>https://redpill78.substack.com/p/newly-leaked-report-from-rand-corporation</a>]
However you can tell the memo was fake because it was poorly written and
formatted. And for example the last page of the report used British
spelling for the word <span class="quote">"neutralise"</span> but the
second page used American spelling for the word <span
class="quote">"behavior"</span>, because the second page of the report
was copied from a real book published by the RAND Corporation:
[<a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=13qGEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR2>https://books.google.com/books?id=13qGEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2</a>]</p>

</h3>
<p>In a Twitch stream on March 1st 2023 UTC, Couey wore a t-shirt which
had the logo of Mossad with the text <span class="quote">"SINCE
1949"</span> below it. The t-shirt was designed by Shlomo Cohen and it's
part of a collection of designs which express love for the state of
Israel:

</div>
<p>JC didn't say anything about the t-shirt during the stream. However
he may have worn the shirt to troll Kevin McCairn, because two days
before JC's stream, McCairn did a stream about a paper by J. Bart
Classen who wrote that Mossad was behind COVID.
[<a href=https://rumble.com/v2b2zdo-world-war-shlomo-part-2-lab-leak-psy-op-classen-and-mossad-covid-klaus.html>https://rumble.com/v2b2zdo-world-war-shlomo-part-2-lab-leak-psy-op-classen-and-mossad-covid-klaus.html</a>,

At that point JC had been in a streaming war with McCairn for a few
months after McCairn and Rixey called out his Scooby Doo clone theories
as nonsense. But why would JC have bought the Mossad t-shirt in the
first place? And what was the point that he just wore the t-shirt on the
stream without ever explaining why he wore it?</p>
<p>Added later: I said on Twitter that JC may have worn the Mossad
t-shirt in order to troll McCairn because two days earlier McCairn had
done a stream where he read a paper which suggested that Mossad was
behind COVID, but JC replied that I had <span class="quote">"a
BINGO"</span>:

<p>(Even though in the case that Couey actually wore the shirt to show

that he would admit it on Twitter.)</p>

<p>I first found out about Couey because his YouTube channel was linked
at the top of this blog post whose co-author Dan Sirotkin is a
self-described <span class="quote">"former NSA counterterrorism
analyst"</span>:

<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-sirotkin.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>Dan Sirotkin tweeted: <span class="quote">"As half Askenazi Jew and
half Cajun, I can't imagine how those white devils sleep at night!!
🤣"</span>.
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1425424404591284231</a>]
He also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Wonder if us Jews get free
bagels..."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1222165786304880640>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1222165786304880640</a>]
He also tweeted: <span class="quote">"Where do I start with the
quarter-to-three-quarter Jew privilege?"</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1298767738811318272</a>]
However he probably gets his Jewish ancestry from his father's side
because he tweeted: <span class="quote">"My last name means <span
class="quote">'orphan'</span> in both Ukrainian and Russian because my
paternal great-great-grandfather had to be hidden in a Catholic
orphanage in Gomel so he didn't end up as the Tsar's cannon-fodder,
since he was a Jew."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097>https://x.com/Harvard2H/status/1603861877993476097</a>]
So his father Karl Sirotkin might be a full Jew.</p>
<p>Out of the earliest videos about COVID that are currently visible on
JC's YouTube channel, in the first video JC discussed blog posts by
harvard2thebighouse, James Lyons-Weiler, and Vincent Racaniello, but the
second video was dedicated to the blog post by harvard2thebighouse (BTW
notice how Couey is rubbing his hands together in his YouTube
thumbnail):
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/&#x40;JConabike/videos>https://www.youtube.com/@JConabike/videos</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/pfizerstew-couey.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>In 2021 JC tweeted a link to his YouTube video from February 2020
where he discussed the blog post by harvard2thebighouse, and he wrote:
<span class="quote">"Before DRASTIC existed, there was an original
duo...Dan and his dad. And then I found them, and we became three. DRASTIC
was after this."</span>

So JC was basically the third member of proto-DRASTIC after a partially
Jewish former NSA counterterrorism analyst and his likely fully Jewish
father.</p>
<p>On a list of <span class="quote">"DRASTIC's key breakthroughs and
research"</span> that was compiled by Charles Rixey, the first entry is
about the blog post by Dan and Karl Sirotkin, the second entry is that
JC started posting YouTube videos about COVID in February 2020, and the
4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th entriess are about work done by Yuri Deigin.
[<a href=i/drastic-key-breakthroughs.jpg>i/drastic-key-breakthroughs.jpg</a>]
However Deigin also tweeted: <span class="quote">"PS: for the record, I
am against censorship. Even for Holocaust deniers. And I'm half
Jewish."</span>
[<a href=https://x.com/ydeigin/status/1396928014454304770>https://x.com/ydeigin/status/1396928014454304770</a>]</p>
<p>JC has been moving in the same circles as George Webb since early
2020, and for example they both appeared in videos with Addy Adds and
Paul Cottrell. And both JC and Webb have collaborated with Housatonic.
Couey tweeted: <span class="quote">"Even crazier when you realize that
my first ever live streams of any kind were invites to join Paul
Cottrell of Operation George Webb, Addy Ads of Operation George Webb,

Addy Adds has even coauthored several books with George Webb, and he
wrote a book about George Webb titled <span class="quote">"Citizen
Journalism &amp; Public Intelligence: How To Tell Your Story"</span>.
[<a href=https://thedukereport.com/authors/addy-adds/>https://thedukereport.com/authors/addy-adds/</a>]
Housatonic has said that Addy comes from a NATO family. But JC also
worked at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam which is the location
of one of NATO's main bioweapon labs according to George Webb.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Webb said that he used to work with Dutch
intelligence in New York, because Webb used to be the sidekick of Jason
Goodman whose current sidekick John Cullen also speaks Dutch, or at
least he has posted several tweets in Dutch:

virologist Dr. Ali Zaki sent a virus sample from the first confirmed
case in Saudi Arabia to virologist Ron Fouchier, a leading coronavirus

So regardless of whether JC's link to Erasmus is relevant or not, it's
interesting that the reference genome of MERS-CoV was published by a
team of people from Erasmus which was led by someone who was an expert
on doing gain-of-function research on RNA viruses.</p>
<p>In January 2025 Couey said that his boss at the University of
Pittsburgh was a Navy officer who had a security clearance: <span

was at the time an active Navy - whatever is underneath Captain - on a
submarine. And so he did ROTC and then went to Harvard and did his
postdoc at Janelia farms. And so he was like a Navy officer, nuclear
sub-trained guy - like hardcore, that's the highest level of technology
in the government as far as I know is nuclear subs - and he was a guy
who got promoted during my time there to Captain, although he wasn't
active anymore. And actually, at some point right before, right during
the start of the pandemic was threatened to be shipped to Africa, to
work on some kind of anti-pirate thing. And so there was talk about how
I might take over the lab for a year. [...] This guy has security

<p>Alex Jones keeps talking about how the globalists are always trying
to recruit him to their side, like how one time he traveled to NYC to
meet with David Rothkopf who was the head of Kissinger Associates and
who invited him to join their side, but he refused the offer. And Alex
says that he keeps receiving offers to join secret Illuminati parties
but he always refuses them. Even though actually he's probably going to
parties at DUMBs where he's sacrificing children to Xenu with George
Soros.</p>
<p>In a stream where JC was talking about how Andrew Huff is probably
controlled opposition, JC said that he has been offered some <span

through with: <span class="quote">"And that's again why I think we have
to use the utmost scrutiny and the utmost skepticism when approaching

be very careful because I don't think we can take him at his word.
Whatever it is, he could be mostly a good guy, just like Robert Malone

occasionally cheats but is otherwise a great guy - I mean, is he really

And in any case, JC received a monthly salary of 7,000 USD from CHD

I wonder if it came with some strings attached. And even though Couey is
supposed to have been fired by the CHD, he might still be getting funded

<p>I previously thought that Housatonic got connected to George Webb
because they were doing the same type of investigative research on
COVID. However Housatonic was frequently talking to George Webb on
Twitter in 2019, and in 2019 before Housatonic had his own YouTube
channel, he appeared several times on John O'Loughlin's channel.
[<a href=https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1130150776016396293>https://x.com/leytedriver/status/1130150776016396293</a>]
In February 2019, O'Loughlin tagged Housatonic and George Webb in a
tweet where he wrote: <span class="quote">"George's videos on Periscope
are available for replay, but Twitter doesn't always post them here.
This is yesterday's Live at National Harbor, where George and I decide

So George Webb was involved in launching the YouTube channel where
Housatonic did his alt media debut. O'Loughlin is the son of a
high-level FBI agent. And he has done several videos in person with
George Webb, because I believe both of them live somewhere in the DC
area, which in itself is suspicious because the headquarters of the FBI,
CIA, and NSA are all located in the DC area (and the former NSA spy Dan
Sirotkin also grew up in the DC area and he still lives in the DC area).
George Webb is getting scoops about uranium deals, but nuclear energy
was one of the topics that Housatonic was focused on before COVID, and
for example O'Loughlin posted this tweet in 2019: <span

Uranium's value as an energy storage medium. Now Kazakhstan has the

Snowden's resume said that he was an <span class="quote">"expert in

gained access to the documents he leaked while he worked at Dell.</p>
<p>In 2019 Housatonic presented himself as a whistleblower who said that
the story that Hillary Clinton's email server was run out of an old
bathroom closet was false, and actually the email server was provided by
a company called Datto where he worked as a director of competitive
intelligence, and in October 2015 the server was retrieved from a data
center by Peter Strzok and other people from the FBI. However I don't
understand what his big revelation was supposed to be, because much of
the information he revealed had already been public since 2015, and his
claim that Peter Strzok personally retrieved the server seems to have
been based on speculation by a Twitter user called TruthinGov2016.</p>
<p>The DNC emails and Hillary's emails were one of the main subjects
George Webb covered before COVID, and they were also the main topic that
QAnon's predecessor FBIAnon posted about on 4chan.

Some people were saying that Seth Rich leaked DNC emails he gained
access to while he was working as IT staff for DNC, even though
Wikipedia says they were released by Russian hackers instead. George
Webb was also peddling an original theory that part of the leaked files
were released by Eric Braverman who was the CEO of the Clinton
Foundation. In early 2020 there were dozens of different theories about
the origin of COVID (including that the virus was brought to Wuhan by
Maatje Benassi), and in the same way in the Pizzagate era there were
dozens of different theories about who released the Clinton and DNC
emails, but in both cases a part of the theories were probably
disinformation that was designed to keep people chasing false leads.</p>
<p>George Webb built up a much of his early following by covering the
Seth Rich story, and Jason Goodman and George Webb came up with the
whole <span class="quote">"who spoofed the Seth Rich files"</span> LARP.

Avisa also coordinated campaigns to discredit invididual people on
behalf of their clients, which sounds similar to the reputation
management services of Thomas Schoenberger's ShadowBox company. A press
release about Avisa described them as <span class="quote">"a global risk

thought his business of offering affordable backup services to citizen

Webb or Jason Goodman? I guess Steve Kirsch also calls himself a

they're both tech guys so they probably wouldn't need help with

the whistle about Hillary's emails</a>
</h3>
<p>In April 2019 Mark Kulacz posted a video where he said the following:
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf%2d%5fjI>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpvuAf%2d%5fjI</a>
/ mirror
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnrWKMlVp00>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnrWKMlVp00</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an accidental backup of Hillary Clinton's emails to an
offsite backup server. That whole picture that you see regarding the
email backups - and like in a bathroom server - that thing is a total
hoax. It is not true, it's not the truth.</p>
<p>The specific situation is that there was a backup device, a physical
backup device from Datto Corporation used. It was paid for by the
service provider that Hillary Clinton was using. And that system was
making essentially hourly full disk image backups of her email server to
an offsite location.</p>
<p>A disk image backup is one where the entire image of the disk,
including all of the blocks that are on the disk drives - the solid
state drives, whether it be a solid state or a mechanical hard drive,
everything - all the metadata, all the files, system metadata,
everything necessary to reconstruct that system is backed up on hourly
basis. That means that even if the data is logically deleted - well, you
know what, unless the data is actually scrubbed - even if the data is
scrubbed on the disk, there are backup copies and backups have a
retention of up to several years.</p>
<p>So even though Hillary Clinton's email server was bleached, bitted,
even though that was the case, several years each hourly backup is going
to be maintained. And before they did the bleached bit, the logical file
deletions of the emails - those - that data would have been backed up as
well. This stuff is all backed up to shared servers, which have a
certain number of clients, which are in the cloud that Datto Corporation
was maintaining.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that - and that was digging in through some,
one of those FBI reports. I happened to notice that there was a guy in
there named Peter Strzok. I thought it was just bad handwriting or
something. S-T-R-Z-O-K. And I started doing some digging. This is
around, let's see here, 2017. And it appears as though Peter Strzock was
called in to handle the situation as part of that whole FBI probe. And
you can actually go through the documents for yourself and ensure enough
back on October - make sure I got the date here - October 5th or October
6th, he and several other people went to the offsite data center and
physically picked up the actual physical server that had those backup
copies on it. Ever since October 2015, the FBI has had <em>the</em>
server with <em>the</em> backup copies on it.</p>
<p>You can look at the FBI file, you can look at the serial number of
the system, it's a 36-drive system, I believe the manufacturer would
have been a super micro.</p>
<p>Of course, this means that all of the data that's on that system from
other companies, which of course would have had the backup to it because
these are our shared systems, would have also had their data unknowingly
confiscated and owned and in position - in possession of - the FBI would
have had that data in their possession. How awful is that?</p>

<p>However I don't understand what his big revelation was supposed to
be, because the story that FBI acquired the backup server from Datto had
been public information since 2015. An article by Daily Caller from
October 2015 said:
[<a href=https://dailycaller.com/2015/10/06/employees-at-hillarys-it-company-worried-they-were-being-asked-to-cover-up-shady-st/>https://dailycaller.com/2015/10/06/employees-at-hillarys-it-company-worried-they-were-being-asked-to-cover-up-shady-st/</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employees at the Denver-based IT company that Hillary Clinton hired
in 2013 to manage her private email network expressed concern that they
were <span class="quote">"covering up"</span> something <span
class="quote">"shady."</span></p>
<p>That's according to a letter sent Monday by Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron
Johnson to Austin McChord, the CEO of Datto Inc., a Connecticut-based
computer cloud storage company.</p>
<p>According to Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and
Government Affairs Committee, a Clinton family company called the
Clinton Executive Services Corp. hired the Denver company, Platte River
Networks, on May 31, 2013 to oversee Clinton's private email network.
Platte River in turn hired Datto to create a virtual backup server of
Clinton's emails.</p>
<p>During most of her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton used a
server that she housed in her Chappaqua, N.Y. home. But data from that
device was transferred to a Datto server controlled by Platte River,
which housed the new hardware at a New Jersey data center.</p>
<p>The FBI seized that server in August after the Intelligence Community
inspector general discovered that Clinton aides had sent her two <span
class="quote">"top secret"</span> emails. Clinton has claimed that she
did not send or receive classified information on her server.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Johnson's letter also provides evidence that Datto may have copies of
Clinton emails, raising hopes that the records could be compared to the
55,000 pages of documents Clinton turned over in December. Clinton has
said that she has turned over all of her work-related emails, though
many observers have questioned the claim.</p>
<p>The FBI has already reportedly recovered some data from Clinton's
server, despite claims she and her attorney have made that no
information exists on the hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought that the new information Kulacz revealed might
have been that the server was personally seized by Peter Strzok. However
Kulacz had already mentioned the theory that Strzok seized the server in
a Twitter thread in 2018:
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520>http://web.archive.org/web/20180120165625/https://x.com/HousatonicITS/status/954173497168875520</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-1.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>The source he cited was a Twitter thread from 2017, where the
hypothesis that Strzok seized the server was based on how Strzok had
signed the letter to Datto which requested handing over the server (but
I think it's poor evidence that he would've personally went to the site
to retrieve the server):
[<a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20180126013331/https://x.com/TruthinGov2016/status/945016245803470848>http://web.archive.org/web/20180126013331/https://x.com/TruthinGov2016/status/945016245803470848</a>]</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-2.jpg width=600>
</div>
<p>Kulacz included the hashtags <span class="quote">"Qanon"</span> and
<span class="quote">"TheStorm"</span> in the last tweet of his thread
about Peter Strzok:</p>
<div>
<img src=i/yt-datto-3.jpg width=500>
</div>
<p>I don't know if Kulacz revealed more details about the Datto story
somewhere else, because many of his oldest videos have now been deleted
and his old Twitter account has been deleted. And I also don't know if
he is supposed to have first come out as a whistleblower about the story
in the video from April 2019 or earlier. But at least in the video from
April 2019 he didn't seem to reveal any new information. And his claim
that Peter Strzok personally retrieved the server seems to have been
based on speculation by someone else on Twitter.</p>

<p>This video featured an audio clip where Terris Renfro said: <span

[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMyTOQdNkDU&t=4m40s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMyTOQdNkDU&amp;t=4m40s</a>]
At the start of the video there was a clip of an old video that Renfro
did with Brian Word and Schoenberger, where Renfro said that he was
friends with Word and he had done videos for Schoenberger.</p>
<p>However it was third-hand information so I don't know if it's
correct, and people associated with Cicada are notorious for starting
false rumors and fabricating screenshots.</p>
<p>The same video featured screenshots of a Twitter DM conversation
where Schoenberger is supposed to have said: <span class="quote">"I was
thrown into something called Is5142 or Stargate. Bruce rescued me in
1980"</span>, and next he wrote <span class="quote">"Keep that private
please....I was recruited because I see the future.."</span>
[<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMyTOQdNkDU&t=7m50s>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMyTOQdNkDU&amp;t=7m50s</a>]
I'm not sure if the first letter in Is5142 is i or L, but I didn't find
any results by googling for <code>"ls5142" "stargate"</code> either way.
Next the person Schoenberger is supposed to have had the DM conversation
wrote this about George Webb's brother Dave Acton: <span
class="quote">"Holy shit! Dave Acton once said he was involved in Remote
Viewing in the AF is it like that?"</span> And then Schoenberger is
supposed to have posted messages that said <span
class="quote">"Yes"</span>, <span class="quote">"I was there start
baby.. Their number 1...."</span>, and <span class="quote">"I escape their
clutches...and now unleash my prophecy to the world, hidden within puzzles
and music...."</span>. However I don't know if the screenshots are real,
and the circle of people around Schoenberger are known to fabricate
screenshots. And if Schoenberger is supposed to be such a genius then
why did he write like a moron? I also didn't find any other source which
would've said that Dave Acton was involved with remote viewing.</p>
<p>Brian Word may have also done work for Schoenberger's cyber
harrassment company called Shadowbox, because the same video featured a
screenshot of an email from 2018 that Thomas Schoenberger is supposed to
have sent to Ed Butowsky, where he wrote: <span class="quote">"This is
my dear buddy Brian. He is willing to help with Shadowbox and can even
come out to help. He is honest, and very smart. He does incredible video
work and is a great attack dog."</span>

However I don't know if the screenshot is fake or what its source is, or
if Brian actually refers to Brian Word.</p>
<p>Other people linked to Cicada also have a connection to remote
viewing. Iona Miller's old bio said: <span class="quote">"Iona is on the
editorial board of JNLRMI, which scientifically investigates quantum
biophysics and psi phenomena including remote healing and remote

Richard Alan Miller's bio seems mostly fictional, but he wrote about
himself that <span class="quote">"He conducted ESP experiments with
astronaut Edgar Mitchell on the dark side of the Moon, and he developed
early protocols and trained Navy Seals in ESP and Super Soldier
techniques."</span>

<p>Trevor Fitzgibbon was previously the main PR guy for Assange,

<p>Fitzgibbon's LinkedIn profile used to say: <span
class="quote">"Working with the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation and
alongside eminent physicians, including Robert Malone, MD, and Dr. Peter
McCullough, Trevor secures high-profile placements, including Joe Rogan,
CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and the Today Show."</span> So I don't
know if he was responsible for getting Malone or McCullough on
Rogan.</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon's LinkedIn profile says: <span class="quote">"His clients
have ranged from the pro-RFK Jr. super PAC American Values 24 to
America's Future and HHS whistleblowers who exposed child trafficking at
the border."</span> Earlier it also said: <span class="quote">"In 2012,
FitzGibbon Helped Take Down Backpage.com Over Child Sex

fighting child sex trafficking, just like David Lopez, Leigh Dundas,
Steve Slepcevik, Robert David Steele, and Sacha Stone.</p>

up in court with <span class="quote">"lawfare"</span>, and trolling them
and their associates online.</p>
<p>For the trolling, we have Thomas and his associates. And for the

<p>In 2016, Trevor helped create #Unity4J, ostensibly as a way to build

bringing people from opposite sides of the political spectrum together,

and attempting to poison progressives with conservative conspiracies.
Legends like Australian Greens' Senator Scott Ludlum were sharing a
platform with people like Cassandra Fairbanks, Jimmy Dore, Kim Dotcom,
and our favourite former Naval Intelligence Officer, Jack Posobiec.</p>
<p>Trevor also appears to do PR for some of the jabronies in the VIPS,

<p>When I searched for <span class="quote">"Trevor Fitzgibbon"</span> on

done with different hosts on TNT Radio. TNT Radio might be some kind of
a pro-Communist operation, because they host shows by several advocates
of a multipolar world order, like Matthew Ehret, Hrvoje Moric from
Geopolitics and Empire, and Jerm Warfare.</p>
<p>An article by the Guardian said that in 2022 TNT Radio launched a
written publication called The Intelligencer, but much of their content
was written by Trevor Fitzgibbon:
[<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/intelligencer-pro-russia-website-trump>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/intelligencer-pro-russia-website-trump</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working alongside contributors for Kremlin state media, the former
Donald Trump policy aide George Papadopoulos, his wife, Simona
Mangiante, and others have become editorial board members of the website
Intelligencer, which is increasingly becoming a source of news for those
in the rightwing ecosystem.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>its articles have been shared on social media by the conspiracist
Alex Jones and former Trump aide Roger Stone.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Although much of the website's content focuses on issues relating to
American politics, the site actually began in Australia, with a
little-known media outlet called TNT Radio, which launched in 2022. Show
hosts and guests frequently deny climate change, discuss culture war
issues in the US, espouse pro-Russian viewpoints on the war in Ukraine,
and spread conspiracy theories about Covid-19.</p>
<p>Jennifer Squires, one of the station's owners, explained in an
interview that Intelligencer began as a way for TNT Radio to have a
written publication to complement its radio station. To develop the new
site, Squires said she turned to George Eliason, an American journalist
who has lived in eastern Ukraine for more than 10 years. Eliason, who
already had a show on TNT Radio at the time, has formerly appeared on RT
and blames Kyiv for the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>nearly half of Intelligencer's board members are either former aides,
surrogates or fake electors for Trump's previous two campaigns.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known ex-Trump official is Papadopoulos, who
served as a foreign policy aide on Trump's 2016 campaign. In 2018, he
pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a
Kremlin-linked professor who told him Russia had dirt on Hilary
Clinton.</p>
<p>Mangiante, his wife, has written several posts for the site about
debunked conspiracy theories involving the Bidens and Ukraine. In
January, she posted an interview with a former Ukrainian lawmaker,
Andrii Derkach, who repeated false claims of bribery about the Biden
family in Ukraine. In 2020, the US placed sanctions on Derkach, calling
him an active Russian agent; Derkach, who now is running for political
office in Russia, previously met with Rudy Giuliani and purported to
offer evidence of corruption against the Bidens.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Intelligencer appears to be one of several
[Russia-friendly] operations targeting the upcoming US elections,
leveraging a network of far-right figures and disinformation
tactics,"</span> Olga Lautman, a senior fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, said.</p>
<p>Mangiante, along with fellow board member Igor Lopatonok, appears to
have parlayed this work into a new documentary about the Hunter Biden
laptop saga called Hunter's Laptop: Requiem for Ukraine. According to
social media posts, the documentary premiered on 5 September at the
Trump International hotel in Chicago. Eliason wrote the script, which
was filmed by Lopatonok, who has frequently collaborated with Oliver
Stone on prior anti-Ukrainian documentaries and fawning films of
dictators.</p>
<p><span class="quote">"Mr Lopatonok wanted fresh eyes from an
investigative journalist and a different perspective for the
story,"</span> Eliason said. <span class="quote">"Through the combined
interviews, we were able to plumb deeper and raise questions that had
not been asked before."</span></p>
<p>Eliason also said that the address listed on Intelligencer's website
was provided by Lopatonok. Lopatonok did not respond to requests for
comment. However, he now appears to have implemented part of his
business in Moscow. According to Russian corporate records, Lopatonok
and his wife, Vera Tomilova, also an Intelligencer board member,
registered a Global 3 Pictures LLC in Moscow in February.</p>
<p>According to invitations for the Hunter Biden documentary premiere,
the event was hosted by the Christian Orthodox Coalition, an
organization which claims to educate Orthodox Christians on social and
cultural issues. Four of the organization's board members are also board
members of Intelligencer, including Papadopoulos, Mangiante and
Lopatonok.</p>
<p>The fourth board member is Olga Ravasi, who was formerly the
chairwoman of Serbs for Trump in 2020 and currently runs the Serbian
American Voters Alliance political action committee. In March,
Intelligencer posted about a Serbs for Trump kick-off event in Wisconsin
with the state's Republican senator Ron Johnson and former Trump acting
director of national intelligence Ric Grenell.</p>
<p>Three other editorial board members also have close connections to
the Trump campaigns. Leah Hoopes and Greg Stenstrom, both from
Pennsylvania, have written a book falsely alleging the 2020 election was
stolen. Both of them have been litigants in court cases challenging the
results of the election in Pennsylvania, and Hoopes was one of
Pennsylvania's fake electors, who falsely signed paperwork saying that
Trump had won the election.</p>
<p>Tyler Nixon, Roger Stone's personal attorney, also serves on the
board and hosts his own show on TNT Radio. <span class="red">The former
Radio Sputnik journalist Lee Stranahan is also involved.</span></p>
<p>Nixon, Hoopes, Stenstrom and Stranahan did not respond to requests
for comment.</p>
<p><span class="red">Most of the site's content appears to be created by
Eliason, and Trevor Fitzgibbon, who was the spokesperson for American
Values 2024, a Super Pac that supported Robert F Kennedy Jr's
presidential campaign.</span> The website has several posts promoting
Kennedy's campaign.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, the site has even more direct ties to Russia beyond its
content. One of its board members is Anna Soroka, an adviser to Leonid
Pasechnik, the head of the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic. In
February 2023, the US sanctioned Pasechnik, calling him the <span

<p>When Malone sued Peter and Ginger Breggin and Jane Ruby for
defamation for 25 million USD, he was represented by Steven Biss. Biss
previously represented Robert David Steele when RDS sued Jason Goodman
for defamation for 24 million USD.</p>
<p>In 2024 Jason Goodman interviewed Robert Malone about
fifth-generation warfare.

The term <span class="quote">"fifth-generation warfare"</span> may have
been coined by Robert David Steele, because in a book titled <span
class="quote">"The Handbook of Fifth-Generation Warfare"</span>, there
is a timeline which describes the origins of the term <span
class="quote">"fifth-generation warfare"</span>, where the very first
entry is about a press release by Robert David Steele from 2003.

<p>In 2018 Biss represented Trevor Fitzgibbon when Fitzgibbon sued
Snowden's lawyer Jesselyn Radack for defamation, but the court ruled in
Fitzgibbon's favor and ordered Radack to pay him about 100,000 USD.
[<a href=https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.445376/gov.uscourts.vaed.445376.62.0.pdf>https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.445376/gov.uscourts.vaed.445376.62.0.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>In 2021 Biss represented Mike Flynn's brother Jack Flynn who sued CNN
for defamation for 75 million USD.

CNN aired footage of him and Mike swearing an oath of allegiance which
included the phrase <span class="quote">"where we go one, we go
all"</span>, but Jack Flynn claimed that CNN falsely presented him as a
follower of Qanon and the oath wasn't related to Q.</p>
<p>In 2019 Biss represented Svetlana Lokhova when she sued Stefan Halper
for 25 million USD for defamation. Halper had accused her of being a
Russian spy and having an affair with Mike Flynn in order to compromise
Flynn on behalf of Russian intelligence.

<p>In 2020 Biss filed a subpoena on behalf of the congressman Devin
Nunes in order to identify the owner of an anonymous Twitter account
which made fun of him called DevinCow.

Nunes is a protege of Mike Flynn, the CEO of Truth Social, and a former
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Biss has also represented
Kash Patel who was Nunes's senior aide in the House Intelligence
Committee, and who according to the New York Times was the primary
author of the Nunes memo which criticized the FBI's actions during the
Russian collusion investigation.

So I checked where the farm operated by the Finders cult was located.

<p>I may have discovered the meaning of the number 3301, but I haven't
seen it proposed by anyone else. 3301 is the 463rd prime number, and
puzzles by Cicada 3301 often involve prime numbers. I found an article
published by The Order of the Thelemic Golden Dawn which included 463
among a list of 32 Thelemic numbers: <span class="quote">"463 =
RA-HOOR-KHVIT (Lord of the New Aeon). 463=Tav-Samekh-Gimel, the three
Paths of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life. 463=MTH HShQD (A Rod of
Almond = the Middle Pillar)."</span>
[<a href=https://www.praemonstro.com/thelemic-astrology-copy>https://www.praemonstro.com/thelemic-astrology-copy</a>]</p>
<p>In an article published in 1993, Dave Cherubim who was a member the
Order of the Thelemic Golden Dawn wrote: <span class="quote">"The
numbers of the Paths of the Middle Pillar are 13 (Gimel), 25 (Samekh)
and 32 (Tav). The sum of these numbers is 70. 70 is the value of the
Hebrew letter Ayin which corresponds with <span class="quote">'Path
26'</span> on the Tree of Life. It is the Path of the Exalted Phallus
and the Pillar itself is a symbol of the erect Phallus. It is the Path
of the Atu of Thoth called <span class="quote">'The Devil'</span>. The
Devil is Pan, the God of Sexual Lust or Phallic Energy; and He is
Baphomet, the Supreme Hieroglyph of the True Self of Man. The sum of the
numbers of the Hebrew letters of each Path of the Middle Pillar is 463
(Tav = 400, Samekh = 60, and Gimel = 3). 463 is the numerical value of
RA-HOOR-KHVIT (Lord of the New Aeon) and it is the number of MTH HShQD
(A Rod of Almond). Note in this connection that Ra-Hoor-Khuit is, in the
Thelemic Qabalah, the God of Kether. Also note that Almond is attributed
to Kether on the Tree of Life, and Kether is the Crown of the Middle
Pillar. The Middle Pillar is, in point of fact, a symbol of the nature
of Kether unfolded as the Universe."</span>

<p>The article by David Cherubim I linked above said: <span
class="quote">"The well-known Golden Dawn magician Francis Israel
Regardie regarded the Middle Pillar as containing the secret of the
Great Work. He considered the Middle Pillar Exercise as being of utmost
value, not only to the aspirant but to the Adept as well. Such was his
high regard for the Middle Pillar Exercise that he even used it to
initiate certain aspirants."</span> The article also said: <span
class="quote">"The Middle Pillar is integration; it is the point of
equilibrium between the two Pillars of the Tree of Life; it is the point
of balance between the two extremes or polarities of the Universe. [...]
Without integration the aspirant can in no manner realize the Great Work
of the Sages. Thus, in the Neophyte Ceremony of the Thelemic Order of
the Golden Dawn, it is proclaimed in the Lecture of Balance, <span
class="quote">'Equilibrium is the basis of the Great
Work.'</span>"</span> However in one of her articles about St. Germain,
Iona Miller also wrote that the Great Work involved finding an
equilibrium between the two opposing forces: <span
class="quote">"Alchemy is a mystical method of self-perfection, by the
symbolical exteriorization of the spiritual processes, by projecting
spiritual interior elements on an exterior plane, the metals. In this
way, the Great Work is ambivalent: a holding of the tension of the
opposites, interior and exterior, unifying the Microcosm and the
Macrocosm and thus annihilating <span class="quote">'Creation'</span>
(the dualistic, split world), reiterating the primordial Unity."</span>

<p>In a book titled <span class="quote">"The Magical and Ritual Use of
Herbs"</span>, Richard Alan Miller recommended people to read a book by
Israel Regardie: <span class="quote">"The first use of sex within the
rituals of western traditions of magic began with the Ordo Templi
Orientis (O.T.O.), an 800-year-old Masonic order in Germany. Members had
studied the Hindu traditions of Tantra and found that the energy
contained in those rituals was greater than in any other known
technique. At the turn of the century, Aleister Crowley became their new
Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.) and rewrote those rituals for a more
contemporary application. For a clear picture of this technique, it is
recommended that the student first read chapter 16 of The Tree of Life
by Israel Regardie, followed by pages 82-86 of Liber Aleph, The Book of
Wisdom or Folly by Aleister Crowley."</span>

<p>When someone on Reddit asked what the meaning of the number 3301 was,
another user posted a cryptic answer which said that <span
class="quote">"3301 is an inspired number forming the division bell
matrix, forming one as path"</span>.
[<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/cicada/comments/abz0hu/why_3301_is_there_something_special_about_this/>https://www.reddit.com/r/cicada/comments/abz0hu/why_3301_is_there_something_special_about_this/</a>]
So the answer said that the number 3301 is related to a path, like how
in Thelema the number 463 signifies a path on the Tree of Life. Division
Bell was an album by Pink Floyd released in 1994, which contained a
hidden puzzle according to a Usenet post by someone with the name
Publius, and as a kind of a Q proof of its time, during one Pink Floyd
concert there were lights in front of the stage which spelled out the
text <span class="quote">"Enigma Publius"</span>.

I thought the <span class="quote">"division bell matrix"</span> might
refer to the Kabbalistic Tree of Life figure, which kind of looks like a
bell divided in two, or which looks like a matrix with multiple columns
and multiple rows, even though I didn't find any source which would've
referred to the Tree of Life figure as a <span class="quote">"division
